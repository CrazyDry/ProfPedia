Keyword and Keyphrase Extraction Using Centrality Measures on  Collocation Networks

  Keyword and keyphrase extraction is an important problem in natural languageprocessing, with applications ranging from summarization to semantic search todocument clustering. Graph-based approaches to keyword and keyphrase extractionavoid the problem of acquiring a large in-domain training corpus by applyingvariants of PageRank algorithm on a network of words. Although graph-basedapproaches are knowledge-lean and easily adoptable in online systems, itremains largely open whether they can benefit from centrality measures otherthan PageRank. In this paper, we experiment with an array of centralitymeasures on word and noun phrase collocation networks, and analyze theirperformance on four benchmark datasets. Not only are there centrality measuresthat perform as well as or better than PageRank, but they are much simpler(e.g., degree, strength, and neighborhood size). Furthermore, centrality-basedmethods give results that are competitive with and, in some cases, better thantwo strong unsupervised baselines.

Entity-Specific Sentiment Classification of Yahoo News Comments

  Sentiment classification is widely used for product reviews and in onlinesocial media such as forums, Twitter, and blogs. However, the problem ofclassifying the sentiment of user comments on news sites has not been addressedyet. News sites cover a wide range of domains including politics, sports,technology, and entertainment, in contrast to other online social sites such asforums and review sites, which are specific to a particular domain. A userassociated with a news site is likely to post comments on diverse topics (e.g.,politics, smartphones, and sports) or diverse entities (e.g., Obama, iPhone, orGoogle). Classifying the sentiment of users tied to various entities may helpobtain a holistic view of their personality, which could be useful inapplications such as online advertising, content personalization, and politicalcampaign planning. In this paper, we formulate the problem of entity-specificsentiment classification of comments posted on news articles in Yahoo News andpropose novel features that are specific to news comments. Experimental resultsshow that our models outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

Privacy Prediction of Images Shared on Social Media Sites Using Deep  Features

  Online image sharing in social media sites such as Facebook, Flickr, andInstagram can lead to unwanted disclosure and privacy violations, when privacysettings are used inappropriately. With the exponential increase in the numberof images that are shared online every day, the development of effective andefficient prediction methods for image privacy settings are highly needed. Theperformance of models critically depends on the choice of the featurerepresentation. In this paper, we present an approach to image privacyprediction that uses deep features and deep image tags as featurerepresentations. Specifically, we explore deep features at various neuralnetwork layers and use the top layer (probability) as an auto-annotationmechanism. The results of our experiments show that models trained on theproposed deep features and deep image tags substantially outperform baselinessuch as those based on SIFT and GIST as well as those that use "bag of tags" asfeatures.

A Search/Crawl Framework for Automatically Acquiring Scientific  Documents

  Despite the advancements in search engine features, ranking methods,technologies, and the availability of programmable APIs, current-dayopen-access digital libraries still rely on crawl-based approaches foracquiring their underlying document collections. In this paper, we propose anovel search-driven framework for acquiring documents for scientific portals.Within our framework, publicly-available research paper titles and author namesare used as queries to a Web search engine. Next, research papers and sourcesof research papers are identified from the search results using accurateclassification modules. Our experiments highlight not only the performance ofour individual classifiers but also the effectiveness of our overallSearch/Crawl framework. Indeed, we were able to obtain approximately 0.665million research documents through our fully-automated framework using about0.076 million queries. These prolific results position Web search as aneffective alternative to crawl methods for acquiring both the actual documentsand seed URLs for future crawls.

Dynamic Deep Multi-modal Fusion for Image Privacy Prediction

  With millions of images that are shared online on social networking sites,effective methods for image privacy prediction are highly needed. In thispaper, we propose an approach for fusing object, scene context, and image tagsmodalities derived from convolutional neural networks for accurately predictingthe privacy of images shared online. Specifically, our approach identifies theset of most competent modalities on the fly, according to each new target imagewhose privacy has to be predicted. The approach considers three stages topredict the privacy of a target image, wherein we first identify theneighborhood images that are visually similar and/or have similar sensitivecontent as the target image. Then, we estimate the competence of the modalitiesbased on the neighborhood images. Finally, we fuse the decisions of the mostcompetent modalities and predict the privacy label for the target image.Experimental results show that our approach predicts the sensitive (or private)content more accurately than the models trained on individual modalities(object, scene, and tags) and prior privacy prediction works. Also, ourapproach outperforms strong baselines, that train meta-classifiers to obtain anoptimal combination of modalities.

Image Privacy Prediction Using Deep Neural Networks

  Images today are increasingly shared online on social networking sites suchas Facebook, Flickr, Foursquare, and Instagram. Despite that current socialnetworking sites allow users to change their privacy preferences, this is oftena cumbersome task for the vast majority of users on the Web, who facedifficulties in assigning and managing privacy settings. Thus, automaticallypredicting images' privacy to warn users about private or sensitive contentbefore uploading these images on social networking sites has become a necessityin our current interconnected world.  In this paper, we explore learning models to automatically predictappropriate images' privacy as private or public using carefully identifiedimage-specific features. We study deep visual semantic features that arederived from various layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well astextual features such as user tags and deep tags generated from deep CNNs.Particularly, we extract deep (visual and tag) features from four pre-trainedCNN architectures for object recognition, i.e., AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-16, andResNet, and compare their performance for image privacy prediction. Results ofour experiments on a Flickr dataset of over thirty thousand images show thatthe learning models trained on features extracted from ResNet outperform thestate-of-the-art models for image privacy prediction. We further investigatethe combination of user tags and deep tags derived from CNN architectures usingtwo settings: (1) SVM on the bag-of-tags features; and (2) text-based CNN. Ourresults show that even though the models trained on the visual features performbetter than those trained on the tag features, the combination of deep visualfeatures with image tags shows improvements in performance over the individualfeature sets.
