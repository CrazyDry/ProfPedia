A Bayesian Approach to Tackling Hard Computational Problems

  We are developing a general framework for using learned Bayesian models fordecision-theoretic control of search and reasoningalgorithms. We illustrate theapproach on the specific task of controlling both general and domain-specificsolvers on a hard class of structured constraint satisfaction problems. Asuccessful strategyfor reducing the high (and even infinite) variance inrunning time typically exhibited by backtracking search algorithms is to cutoff and restart the search if a solution is not found within a certainamount oftime. Previous work on restart strategies have employed fixed cut off values.We show how to create a dynamic cut off strategy by learning a Bayesian modelthat predicts the ultimate length of a trial based on observing the earlybehavior of the search algorithm. Furthermore, we describe the generalconditions under which a dynamic restart strategy can outperform thetheoretically optimal fixed strategy.

Tales of Two Cities: Using Social Media to Understand Idiosyncratic  Lifestyles in Distinctive Metropolitan Areas

  Lifestyles are a valuable model for understanding individuals' physical andmental lives, comparing social groups, and making recommendations for improvingpeople's lives. In this paper, we examine and compare lifestyle behaviors ofpeople living in cities of different sizes, utilizing freely available socialmedia data as a large-scale, low-cost alternative to traditional surveymethods. We use the Greater New York City area as a representative for largecities, and the Greater Rochester area as a representative for smaller citiesin the United States. We employed matrix factor analysis as an unsupervisedmethod to extract salient mobility and work-rest patterns for a largepopulation of users within each metropolitan area. We discovered interestinghuman behavior patterns at both a larger scale and a finer granularity than ispresent in previous literature, some of which allow us to quantitativelycompare the behaviors of individuals of living in big cities to those living insmall cities. We believe that our social media-based approach to lifestyleanalysis represents a powerful tool for social computing in the big data age.

Analyzing Uncivil Speech Provocation and Implicit Topics in Online  Political News

  Online news has made dissemination of information a faster and more efficientprocess. Additionally, the shift from a print medium to an online interface hasenabled user interactions, creating a space to mutually understand the readerresponses generated by the consumption of news articles. Intermittently, thepositive environment is transformed into a hate-spewing contest, with theamount and target of incivility varying depending on the specific news websitein question. In this paper, we develop methods to study the emergence ofincivility within the reader communities in news sites. First, we create adataset of political news articles and their reader comments from partisan newssites. Then, we train classifiers to predict different aspects of uncivilspeech in comments. We apply these classifiers to predict whether a newsarticle is likely to provoke a substantial portion of reader commentscontaining uncivil language by analyzing only the article's content. Finally,we devise a technique to "read between the lines" --- finding the topics ofdiscussions that an article triggers among its readers without frequent,explicit mentions of these topics in its content.

Job-related discourse on social media

  Working adults spend nearly one third of their daily time at their jobs. Inthis paper, we study job-related social media discourse from a community ofusers. We use both crowdsourcing and local expertise to train a classifier todetect job-related messages on Twitter. Additionally, we analyze the linguisticdifferences in a job-related corpus of tweets between individual users vs.commercial accounts. The volumes of job-related tweets from individual usersindicate that people use Twitter with distinct monthly, daily, and hourlypatterns. We further show that the moods associated with jobs, positive andnegative, have unique diurnal rhythms.

Reasoning Under the Principle of Maximum Entropy for Modal Logics K45,  KD45, and S5

  We propose modal Markov logic as an extension of propositional Markov logicto reason under the principle of maximum entropy for modal logics K45, KD45,and S5. Analogous to propositional Markov logic, the knowledge base consists ofweighted formulas, whose weights are learned from data. However, in contrast toMarkov logic, in our framework we use the knowledge base to define aprobability distribution over non-equivalent epistemic situations (pointedKripke structures) rather than over atoms, and use this distribution to assignprobabilities to modal formulas. As in all probabilistic representations, thecentral task in our framework is inference. Although the size of the statespace grows doubly exponentially in the number of propositions in the domain,we provide an algorithm that scales only exponentially in the size of theknowledge base. Finally, we briefly discuss the case of languages with aninfinite number of propositions.

Predicting Acute Kidney Injury at Hospital Re-entry Using  High-dimensional Electronic Health Record Data

  Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a sudden decline in kidney function, is associatedwith increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and hospital cost. SinceAKI is sometimes preventable, there is great interest in prediction. Mostexisting studies consider all patients and therefore restrict to featuresavailable in the first hours of hospitalization. Here, the focus is instead onrehospitalized patients, a cohort in which rich longitudinal features fromprior hospitalizations can be analyzed. Our objective is to provide a riskscore directly at hospital re-entry. Gradient boosting, penalized logisticregression (with and without stability selection), and a recurrent neuralnetwork are trained on two years of adult inpatient EHR data (3,387 attributesfor 34,505 patients who generated 90,013 training samples with 5,618 cases and84,395 controls). Predictions are internally evaluated with 50 iterations of5-fold grouped cross-validation with special emphasis on calibration, ananalysis of which is performed at the patient as well as hospitalization level.Error is assessed with respect to diagnosis, race, age, gender, AKIidentification method, and hospital utilization. In an additional experiment,the regularization penalty is severely increased to induce parsimony andinterpretability. Predictors identified for rehospitalized patients are alsoreported with a special analysis of medications that might be modifiable riskfactors. Insights from this study might be used to construct a predictive toolfor AKI in rehospitalized patients. An accurate estimate of AKI risk athospital entry might serve as a prior for an admitting provider or anotherpredictive algorithm.

Inferring Fine-grained Details on User Activities and Home Location from  Social Media: Detecting Drinking-While-Tweeting Patterns in Communities

  Nearly all previous work on geo-locating latent states and activities fromsocial media confounds general discussions about activities, self-reports ofusers participating in those activities at times in the past or future, andself-reports made at the immediate time and place the activity occurs.Activities, such as alcohol consumption, may occur at different places andtypes of places, and it is important not only to detect the local regions wherethese activities occur, but also to analyze the degree of participation in themby local residents. In this paper, we develop new machine learning basedmethods for fine-grained localization of activities and home locations fromTwitter data. We apply these methods to discover and compare alcoholconsumption patterns in a large urban area, New York City, and a more suburbanand rural area, Monroe County. We find positive correlations between the rateof alcohol consumption reported among a community's Twitter users and thedensity of alcohol outlets, demonstrating that the degree of correlation variessignificantly between urban and suburban areas. While our experiments arefocused on alcohol use, our methods for locating homes and distinguishingtemporally-specific self-reports are applicable to a broad range of behaviorsand latent states.

Location-Based Reasoning about Complex Multi-Agent Behavior

  Recent research has shown that surprisingly rich models of human activity canbe learned from GPS (positional) data. However, most effort to date hasconcentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical properties of groupsof people. Moreover, prior work focused solely on modeling actual successfulexecutions (and not failed or attempted executions) of the activities ofinterest. We, in contrast, take on the task of understanding humaninteractions, attempted interactions, and intentions from noisy sensor data ina fully relational multi-agent setting. We use a real-world game of capture theflag to illustrate our approach in a well-defined domain that involves manydistinct cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domainusing Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory thatjointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, suchas a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model combines constraints imposedby the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by therules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically soundfashion. We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect amulti-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of theactivity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the futurebehaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have precededit. Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed multi-agentactivities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts at the sameactivities, our system automatically learns an augmented model that is capableof recognizing success and failure, as well as goals of peoples actions withhigh accuracy. We compare our approach with other alternatives and show thatour unified model, which takes into account not only relationships amongindividual players, but also relationships among activities over the entirelength of a game, although more computationally costly, is significantly moreaccurate. Finally, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling unsuccessfulattempts boosts performance on other important recognition tasks.
