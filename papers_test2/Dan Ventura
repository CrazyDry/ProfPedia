Quantum Harmonic Sieve: Learning DNF with a Classical Example Oracle

  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to a problem with*efficiently* predicting the large fourier coefficients. It is being reworkedand will be resubmitted in the near future.

Initializing the Amplitude Distribution of a Quantum State

  To date, quantum computational algorithms have operated on a superposition ofall basis states of a quantum system. Typically, this is because it is assumedthat some function f is known and implementable as a unitary evolution.However, what if only some points of the function f are known? It then becomesimportant to be able to encode only the knowledge that we have about f. Thispaper presents an algorithm that requires a polynomial number of elementaryoperations for initializing a quantum system to represent only the m knownpoints of a function f.

A Quantum Computational Learning Algorithm

  An interesting classical result due to Jackson allows polynomial-timelearning of the function class DNF using membership queries. Since in mostpractical learning situations access to a membership oracle is unrealistic,this paper explores the possibility that quantum computation might allow alearning algorithm for DNF that relies only on example queries. A naturalextension of Fourier-based learning into the quantum domain is presented. Thealgorithm requires only an example oracle, and it runs in O(sqrt(2^n)) time, aresult that appears to be classically impossible. The algorithm is unique amongquantum algorithms in that it does not assume a priori knowledge of a functionand does not operate on a superposition that includes all possible states.

Quantum Associative Memory

  This paper combines quantum computation with classical neural network theoryto produce a quantum computational learning algorithm. Quantum computation usesmicroscopic quantum level effects to perform computational tasks and hasproduced results that in some cases are exponentially faster than theirclassical counterparts. The unique characteristics of quantum theory may alsobe used to create a quantum associative memory with a capacity exponential inthe number of neurons. This paper combines two quantum computational algorithmsto produce such a quantum associative memory. The result is an exponentialincrease in the capacity of the memory when compared to traditional associativememories such as the Hopfield network. The paper covers necessary high-levelquantum mechanical and quantum computational ideas and introduces a quantumassociative memory. Theoretical analysis proves the utility of the memory, andit is noted that a small version should be physically realizable in the nearfuture.

Multiple Star Systems in the Orion Nebula

  This work presents an interferometric study of the massive-binary fraction inthe Orion Trapezium Cluster with the recently comissioned GRAVITY instrument.We observe a total of 16 stars of mainly OB spectral type. We find threepreviously unknown companions for $\theta ^1$ Ori B, $\theta ^2$ Ori B, and$\theta ^2$ Ori C. We determine a separation for the previously suspectedcompanion of NU Ori. We confirm four companions for $\theta ^1$ Ori A, $\theta^1$ Ori C, $\theta ^1$ Ori D, and $\theta ^2$ Ori A, all with substantiallyimproved astrometry and photometric mass estimates. We refine the orbit of theeccentric high-mass binary $\theta ^1$ Ori C and we are able to derive a neworbit for $\theta ^1$ Ori D. We find a system mass of 21.7 $M_{\odot}$ and aperiod of $53$ days. Together with other previously detected companions seen inspectroscopy or direct imaging, eleven of the 16 high-mass stars are multiplesystems. We obtain a total number of 22 companions with separations up to 600AU. The companion fraction of the early B and O stars in our sample is about 2,significantly higher than in earlier studies of mostly OB associations. Theseparation distribution hints towards a bimodality. Such a bimodality has beenpreviously found in A stars, but rarely in OB binaries, which up to this pointhave been assumed to be mostly compact with a tail of wider companions. We alsodo not find a substantial population of equal-mass binaries. The observeddistribution of mass ratios declines steeply with mass, and like the directstar counts, indicates that our companions follow a standard power law initialmass function. Again, this is in contrast to earlier findings of flat massratio distributions in OB associations. We exclude collision as a dominantformation mechanism but find no clear preference for core accretion orcompetitive accretion.

The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment: Exploring Fundamental Symmetries  of the Universe

  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early Universe, thedynamics of the supernova bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary forlife and whether protons eventually decay --- these mysteries at the forefrontof particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the earlyevolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. TheLong-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developedplan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNEis conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensityneutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at FermiNational Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstreamof the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployedas a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground ResearchFacility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine inLead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source atFermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrinocharge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yetcost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and canaccommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptionalcombination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, andpotential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facilityfor the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from aroundthe globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year programof exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview ofLBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physicsworldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it willpossess.
