Solving POMDPs by Searching in Policy Space

  Most algorithms for solving POMDPs iteratively improve a value function thatimplicitly represents a policy and are said to search in value function space.This paper presents an approach to solving POMDPs that represents a policyexplicitly as a finite-state controller and iteratively improves the controllerby search in policy space. Two related algorithms illustrate this approach. Thefirst is a policy iteration algorithm that can outperform value iteration insolving infinitehorizon POMDPs. It provides the foundation for a new heuristicsearch algorithm that promises further speedup by focusing computational efforton regions of the problem space that are reachable, or likely to be reached,from a start state.

Suboptimality Bounds for Stochastic Shortest Path Problems

  We consider how to use the Bellman residual of the dynamic programmingoperator to compute suboptimality bounds for solutions to stochastic shortestpath problems. Such bounds have been previously established only in the specialcase that "all policies are proper," in which case the dynamic programmingoperator is known to be a contraction, and have been shown to be easilycomputable only in the more limited special case of discounting. Under thecondition that transition costs are positive, we show that suboptimality boundscan be easily computed even when not all policies are proper. In the generalcase when there are no restrictions on transition costs, the analysis is morecomplex. But we present preliminary results that show such bounds are possible.

The Expected Size of the Rule k Dominating Set

  Rule k is a localized approximation algorithm that finds a small connecteddominating set in a graph. We estimate the expected size of the Rule kdominating set for the model of random unit disk graphs constructed from nrandom points in an s_n by s_n square region of the plane.

Probabilistic Analysis of Rule 2

  Li and Wu proposed Rule 2, a localized approximation algorithm that attemptsto find a small connected dominating set in a graph. Here we study theasymptotic performance of Rule 2 on random unit disk graphs formed from nrandom points in an s_n by s_n square region of the plane. If s_n is below thethreshold for connectivity, then Rule 2 produces a dominating set whoseexpected size is O(n/(loglog n)^{3/2}). We conjecture that this bound is notoptimal.

Sparse Stochastic Finite-State Controllers for POMDPs

  Bounded policy iteration is an approach to solving infinite-horizon POMDPsthat represents policies as stochastic finite-state controllers and iterativelyimproves a controller by adjusting the parameters of each node using linearprogramming. In the original algorithm, the size of the linear programs, andthus the complexity of policy improvement, depends on the number of parametersof each node, which grows with the size of the controller. But in practice, thenumber of parameters of a node with non-zero values is often very small, anddoes not grow with the size of the controller. Based on this observation, wedevelop a version of bounded policy iteration that leverages the sparsestructure of a stochastic finite-state controller. In each iteration, itimproves a policy by the same amount as the original algorithm, but with muchbetter scalability.

Gabor Transforms on the Sphere with Applications to CMB Power Spectrum  Estimation

  The Fourier transform of a dataset apodised with a window function is knownas the Gabor transform. In this paper we extend the Gabor transform formalismto the sphere with the intention of applying it to CMB data analysis. The Gaborcoefficients on the sphere known as the pseudo power spectrum is studied forwindows of different size. By assuming that the pseudo power spectrumcoefficients are Gaussian distributed, we formulate a likelihood ansatz usingthese as input parameters to estimate the full sky power spectrum from a patchon the sky. Since this likelihood can be calculated quickly without having toinvert huge matrices, this allows for fast power spectrum estimation. By usingthe pseudo power spectrum from several patches on the sky together, the fullsky power spectrum can be estimated from full-sky or nearly full-skyobservations.

Robust, frequency-stable and accurate mid-IR laser spectrometer based on  frequency comb metrology of quantum cascade lasers up-converted in  orientation-patterned GaAs

  We demonstrate a robust and simple method for measurement, stabilization andtuning of the frequency of cw mid-infrared (MIR) lasers, in particular ofquantum cascade lasers. The proof of principle is performed with a quantumcascade laser at 5.4 \mu m, which is upconverted to 1.2 \mu m by sum-frequencygeneration in orientation-patterned GaAs with the output of a standardhigh-power cw 1.5 \mu m fiber laser. Both the 1.2 \mu m and the 1.5 \mu m wavesare measured by a standard Er:fiber frequency comb. Frequency measurement atthe 100 kHz-level, stabilization to sub-10 kHz level, controlled frequencytuning and long-term stability are demonstrated.

Solving Multistage Influence Diagrams using Branch-and-Bound Search

  A branch-and-bound approach to solving influ- ence diagrams has beenpreviously proposed in the literature, but appears to have never beenimplemented and evaluated - apparently due to the difficulties of computingeffective bounds for the branch-and-bound search. In this paper, we describehow to efficiently compute effective bounds, and we develop a practicalimplementa- tion of depth-first branch-and-bound search for influence diagramevaluation that outperforms existing methods for solving influence diagramswith multiple stages.

The HEALPix Primer

  HEALPix is a Hierarchical, Equal Area, and iso-Latitude Pixelisation of thesphere designed to support efficiently  - local operations on the pixel set,  - a hierarchical tree structure for multi-resolution applications, and  - the global Fast Spherical Harmonic transform.  The HEALPix concept and the mathematical software based on it introduced inthis primer meet the challenges which future high resolution and large volumeCMB data sets including the MAP and Planck mission products will present.

Neighbourhood Structures: Bisimilarity and Basic Model Theory

  Neighbourhood structures are the standard semantic tool used to reason aboutnon-normal modal logics. The logic of all neighbourhood models is calledclassical modal logic. In coalgebraic terms, a neighbourhood frame is acoalgebra for the contravariant powerset functor composed with itself, denotedby 2^2. We use this coalgebraic modelling to derive notions of equivalencebetween neighbourhood structures. 2^2-bisimilarity and behavioural equivalenceare well known coalgebraic concepts, and they are distinct, since 2^2 does notpreserve weak pullbacks. We introduce a third, intermediate notion whosewitnessing relations we call precocongruences (based on pushouts). We giveback-and-forth style characterisations for 2^2-bisimulations andprecocongruences, we show that on a single coalgebra, precocongruences capturebehavioural equivalence, and that between neighbourhood structures,precocongruences are a better approximation of behavioural equivalence than2^2-bisimulations. We also introduce a notion of modal saturation forneighbourhood models, and investigate its relationship with definability andimage-finiteness. We prove a Hennessy-Milner theorem for modally saturated andfor image-finite neighbourhood models. Our main results are an analogue of VanBenthem's characterisation theorem and a model-theoretic proof of Craiginterpolation for classical modal logic.

Improving the Scalability of Optimal Bayesian Network Learning with  External-Memory Frontier Breadth-First Branch and Bound Search

  Previous work has shown that the problem of learning the optimal structure ofa Bayesian network can be formulated as a shortest path finding problem in agraph and solved using A* search. In this paper, we improve the scalability ofthis approach by developing a memory-efficient heuristic search algorithm forlearning the structure of a Bayesian network. Instead of using A*, we propose afrontier breadth-first branch and bound search that leverages the layeredstructure of the search graph of this problem so that no more than two layersof the graph, plus solution reconstruction information, need to be stored inmemory at a time. To further improve scalability, the algorithm stores most ofthe graph in external memory, such as hard disk, when it does not fit in RAM.Experimental results show that the resulting algorithm solves significantlylarger problems than the current state of the art.

Solving Limited-Memory Influence Diagrams Using Branch-and-Bound Search

  A limited-memory influence diagram (LIMID) generalizes a traditionalinfluence diagram by relaxing the assumptions of regularity and no-forgetting,allowing a wider range of decision problems to be modeled. Algorithms forsolving traditional influence diagrams are not easily generalized to solveLIMIDs, however, and only recently have exact algorithms for solving LIMIDsbeen developed. In this paper, we introduce an exact algorithm for solvingLIMIDs that is based on branch-and-bound search. Our approach is related to theapproach of solving an influence diagram by converting it to an equivalentdecision tree, with the difference that the LIMID is converted to a muchsmaller decision graph that can be searched more efficiently.

MASTER of the CMB Anisotropy Power Spectrum: A Fast Method for  Statistical Analysis of Large and Complex CMB Data Sets

  We describe a fast and accurate method for estimation of the cosmic microwavebackground (CMB) anisotropy angular power spectrum --- Monte Carlo ApodisedSpherical Transform EstimatoR. Originally devised for use in the interpretationof the Boomerang experimental data, MASTER is both a computationally efficientmethod suitable for use with the currently available CMB data sets (alreadylarge in size, despite covering small fractions of the sky, and affected byinhomogeneous and correlated noise), and a very promising application for theanalysis of very large future CMB satellite mission products.

HEALPix -- a Framework for High Resolution Discretization, and Fast  Analysis of Data Distributed on the Sphere

  HEALPix -- the Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelization -- is aversatile data structure with an associated library of computational algorithmsand visualization software that supports fast scientific applicationsexecutable directly on very large volumes of astronomical data and large areasurveys in the form of discretized spherical maps. Originally developed toaddress the data processing and analysis needs of the present generation ofcosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments (e.g. BOOMERanG, WMAP), HEALPixcan be expanded to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise inconfrontation with the observational output of future missions and experiments,including e.g. Planck, Herschel, SAFIR, and the Beyond Einstein CMBpolarization probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and constraintsto be met in order to implement a sufficient framework for the efficientdiscretization and fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere,and summarise how they are satisfied by HEALPix.

A Heuristic Search Approach to Planning with Continuous Resources in  Stochastic Domains

  We consider the problem of optimal planning in stochastic domains withresource constraints, where the resources are continuous and the choice ofaction at each step depends on resource availability. We introduce the HAO*algorithm, a generalization of the AO* algorithm that performs search in ahybrid state space that is modeled using both discrete and continuous statevariables, where the continuous variables represent monotonic resources. Likeother heuristic search algorithms, HAO* leverages knowledge of the start stateand an admissible heuristic to focus computational effort on those parts of thestate space that could be reached from the start state by following an optimalpolicy. We show that this approach is especially effective when resourceconstraints limit how much of the state space is reachable. Experimentalresults demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain that motivates ourresearch: automated planning for planetary exploration rovers.

Symbolic Generalization for On-line Planning

  Symbolic representations have been used successfully in off-line planningalgorithms for Markov decision processes. We show that they can also improvethe performance of on-line planners. In addition to reducing computation time,symbolic generalization can reduce the amount of costly real-world interactionsrequired for convergence. We introduce Symbolic Real-Time Dynamic Programming(or sRTDP), an extension of RTDP. After each step of on-line interaction withan environment, sRTDP uses symbolic model-checking techniques to generalizesits experience by updating a group of states rather than a single state. Weexamine two heuristic approaches to dynamic grouping of states and show thatthey accelerate the planning process significantly in terms of both CPU timeand the number of steps of interaction with the environment.

Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from Paleoclimate  Data, Climate Modeling, and Modern Observations that 2°C Global Warming  is Dangerous

  We use numerical climate simulations, paleoclimate data, and modernobservations to study the effect of growing ice melt from Antarctica andGreenland. Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifyingfeedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Coldmeltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in theSouthern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance andheat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surfacecooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on theSouthern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation,and increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contactwith the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize thatice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea levelseveral meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linearresponse. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level risein about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near thelower end of the 10-40 year range, but the record is too short to confirm thenature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, helpexplain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role incontrolling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on globaltemperature and sea level. The millennial (500-2000 year) time scale of deepocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO2 change and thus thetime scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but thispaleo millennial time scale should not be misinterpreted as the time scale forice sheet response to a rapid large human-made climate forcing.

Policy Iteration for Decentralized Control of Markov Decision Processes

  Coordination of distributed agents is required for problems arising in manyareas, including multi-robot systems, networking and e-commerce. As a formalframework for such problems, we use the decentralized partially observableMarkov decision process (DEC-POMDP). Though much work has been done on optimaldynamic programming algorithms for the single-agent version of the problem,optimal algorithms for the multiagent case have been elusive. The maincontribution of this paper is an optimal policy iteration algorithm for solvingDEC-POMDPs. The algorithm uses stochastic finite-state controllers to representpolicies. The solution can include a correlation device, which allows agents tocorrelate their actions without communicating. This approach alternates betweenexpanding the controller and performing value-preserving transformations, whichmodify the controller without sacrificing value. We present two efficientvalue-preserving transformations: one can reduce the size of the controller andthe other can improve its value while keeping the size fixed. Empirical resultsdemonstrate the usefulness of value-preserving transformations in increasingvalue while keeping controller size to a minimum. To broaden the applicabilityof the approach, we also present a heuristic version of the policy iterationalgorithm, which sacrifices convergence to optimality. This algorithm furtherreduces the size of the controllers at each step by assuming that probabilitydistributions over the other agents actions are known. While this assumptionmay not hold in general, it helps produce higher quality solutions in our testproblems.

Anatomy of a Crash

  Transportation networks constitute a critical infrastructure enabling thetransfers of passengers and goods, with a significant impact on the economy atdifferent scales. Transportation modes, whether air, road or rail, are coupledand interdependent. The frequent occurrence of perturbations on one or severalmodes disrupts passengers' entire journeys, directly and through rippleeffects. The present paper provides a case report of the Asiana Crash in SanFrancisco International Airport on July 6th 2013 and its repercussions on themultimodal transportation network. It studies the resulting propagation ofdisturbances on the transportation infrastructure in the United States. Theperturbation takes different forms and varies in scale and time frame :cancellations and delays snowball in the airspace, highway traffic near theairport is impacted by congestion in previously never congested locations, andtransit passenger demand exhibit unusual traffic peaks in between airports inthe Bay Area. This paper, through a case study, aims at stressing theimportance of further data-driven research on interdependent infrastructurenetworks for increased resilience. The end goal is to form the basis foroptimization models behind providing more reliable passenger door-to-doorjourneys.

Performance of a Large-area GEM Detector Read Out with Wide Radial  Zigzag Strips

  A 1-meter-long trapezoidal Triple-GEM detector with wide readout strips wastested in hadron beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility in October 2013. Thereadout strips have a special zigzag geometry and run along the radialdirection with an azimuthal pitch of 1.37 mrad to measure the azimuthalphi-coordinate of incident particles. The zigzag geometry of the readoutreduces the required number of electronic channels by a factor of threecompared to conventional straight readout strips while preserving good angularresolution. The average crosstalk between zigzag strips is measured to be anacceptable 5.5%. The detection efficiency of the detector is (98.4+-0.2)%. Whenthe non-linearity of the zigzag-strip response is corrected with trackinformation, the angular resolution is measured to be (193+-3) urad, whichcorresponds to 14% of the angular strip pitch. Multiple Coulomb scatteringeffects are fully taken into account in the data analysis with the help of astand-alone Geant4 simulation that estimates interpolated track errors.

Two Transiting Low Density Sub-Saturns from K2

  We report the discovery and confirmation of two sub-Saturn planets orbiting abright (V = 11.3), metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.42 $\pm$ 0.04 dex) G3 dwarf in the K2Campaign 2 field. The planets are 5.68 $\pm$ 0.56 Earth-radii and 7.82 $\pm$0.72 Earth-radii and have orbital periods of 20.8851 $\pm$ 0.0003 d and42.3633$\pm$0.0006 d, near to the 2:1 mean-motion resonance. We obtained 32radial velocities (RVs) with Keck/HIRES and detected the reflex motion due toEPIC-203771098b and c. These planets have masses of 21.0 $\pm$ 5.4 Earth-massesand 27.0 $\pm$ 6.9 Earth-masses, respectively. With low densities of 0.63 $\pm$0.25 g/cc and 0.31 $\pm$ 0.12 g/cc, respectively, the planets require thickenvelopes of H/He to explain their large sizes and low masses. Interiorstructure models predict that the planets have fairly massive cores of 17.6$\pm$ 4.3 Earth-masses and 16.1 $\pm$ 4.2 Earth-masses, respectively. They mayhave formed exterior to their present locations, accreted their H/He envelopesat large orbital distances, and migrated in as a resonant pair. The proximityto resonance, large transit depths, and host star brightness offer richopportunities for TTV follow-up. Finally, the low surface gravities of theEPIC-203771098 planets make them favorable targets for transmissionspectroscopy by HST, Spitzer, and JWST.

The First Kepler Mission Planet Confirmed With The Hobby-Eberly  Telescope: Kepler-15b, a Hot Jupiter Enriched In Heavy Elements

  We report the discovery of Kepler-15b, a new transiting exoplanet detected byNASA's Kepler mission. The transit signal with a period of 4.94 days wasdetected in the quarter 1 (Q1) Kepler photometry. For the first time, we haveused the High-Resolution-Spectrograph (HRS) at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET)to determine the mass of a Kepler planet via precise radial velocity (RV)measurements. The 24 HET/HRS radial velocities (RV) and 6 additionalmeasurements from the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT)reveal a Doppler signal with the same period and phase as the transitephemeris. We used one HET/HRS spectrum of Kepler-15 taken without the iodinecell to determine accurate stellar parameters. The host star is a metal-rich([Fe/H]=0.36+/-0.07) G-type main sequence star with T_eff=5515+/-124 K. Theamplitude of the RV-orbit yields a mass of the planet of 0.66+/-0.1 M_Jup. Theplanet has a radius of 0.96+/-0.06 R_Jup and a mean bulk density of 0.9+/-0.2g/cm^3. The planetary radius resides on the lower envelope for transitingplanets with similar mass and irradiation level. This suggests significantenrichment of the planet with heavy elements. We estimate a heavy element massof 30-40 M_Earth within Kepler-15b.

4MOST - 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope

  The 4MOST consortium is currently halfway through a Conceptual Design studyfor ESO with the aim to develop a wide-field (>3 square degree, goal >5 squaredegree), high-multiplex (>1500 fibres, goal 3000 fibres) spectroscopic surveyfacility for an ESO 4m-class telescope (VISTA). 4MOST will run permanently onthe telescope to perform a 5 year public survey yielding more than 20 millionspectra at resolution R~5000 ({\lambda}=390-1000 nm) and more than 2 millionspectra at R~20,000 (395-456.5 nm & 587-673 nm). The 4MOST design is especiallyintended to complement three key all-sky, space-based observatories of primeEuropean interest: Gaia, eROSITA and Euclid. Initial design and performanceestimates for the wide-field corrector concepts are presented. We consider twofibre positioner concepts, a well-known Phi-Theta system and a new R-Thetaconcept with a large patrol area. The spectrographs are fixed configurationtwo-arm spectrographs, with dedicated spectrographs for the high- andlow-resolution. A full facility simulator is being developed to guide trade-offdecisions regarding the optimal field-of-view, number of fibres needed, and therelative fraction of high-to-low resolution fibres. Mock catalogues withtemplate spectra from seven Design Reference Surveys are simulated to verifythe science requirements of 4MOST. The 4MOST consortium aims to deliver thefull 4MOST facility by the end of 2018 and start delivering high-level dataproducts for both consortium and ESO community targets a year later with yearlyincrements.

Energy Estimation of Cosmic Rays with the Engineering Radio Array of the  Pierre Auger Observatory

  The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is part of the Pierre AugerObservatory and is used to detect the radio emission of cosmic-ray air showers.These observations are compared to the data of the surface detector stations ofthe Observatory, which provide well-calibrated information on the cosmic-rayenergies and arrival directions. The response of the radio stations in the 30to 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction ofthe incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area isdetermined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolatedusing a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries dueto interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components.The spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement ofthe energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in theAERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV airshower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy-- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energyestimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against thesurface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimatorscales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherentemission. We find an energy resolution of the radio reconstruction of 22% forthe data set and 17% for a high-quality subset containing only events with atleast five radio stations with signal.

Measurement of the cosmic ray spectrum above $4{\times}10^{18}$ eV using  inclined events detected with the Pierre Auger Observatory

  A measurement of the cosmic-ray spectrum for energies exceeding$4{\times}10^{18}$ eV is presented, which is based on the analysis of showerswith zenith angles greater than $60^{\circ}$ detected with the Pierre AugerObservatory between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013. The measured spectrumconfirms a flux suppression at the highest energies. Above $5.3{\times}10^{18}$eV, the "ankle", the flux can be described by a power law $E^{-\gamma}$ withindex $\gamma=2.70 \pm 0.02 \,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.1\,\text{(sys)}$ followed bya smooth suppression region. For the energy ($E_\text{s}$) at which thespectral flux has fallen to one-half of its extrapolated value in the absenceof suppression, we find$E_\text{s}=(5.12\pm0.25\,\text{(stat)}^{+1.0}_{-1.2}\,\text{(sys)}){\times}10^{19}$eV.

Measurement of the Radiation Energy in the Radio Signal of Extensive Air  Showers as a Universal Estimator of Cosmic-Ray Energy

  We measure the energy emitted by extensive air showers in the form of radioemission in the frequency range from 30 to 80 MHz. Exploiting the accurateenergy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we obtain a radiation energy of15.8 \pm 0.7 (stat) \pm 6.7 (sys) MeV for cosmic rays with an energy of 1 EeVarriving perpendicularly to a geomagnetic field of 0.24 G, scalingquadratically with the cosmic-ray energy. A comparison with predictions fromstate-of-the-art first-principle calculations shows agreement with ourmeasurement. The radiation energy provides direct access to the calorimetricenergy in the electromagnetic cascade of extensive air showers. Comparison withour result thus allows the direct calibration of any cosmic-ray radio detectoragainst the well-established energy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

An improved limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos  from the Pierre Auger Observatory

  Neutrinos in the cosmic ray flux with energies near 1 EeV and above aredetectable with the Surface Detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Wereport here on searches through Auger data from 1 January 2004 until 20 June2013. No neutrino candidates were found, yielding a limit to the diffuse fluxof ultra-high energy neutrinos that challenges the Waxman-Bahcall boundpredictions. Neutrino identification is attempted using the broadtime-structure of the signals expected in the SD stations, and is efficientlydone for neutrinos of all flavors interacting in the atmosphere at large zenithangles, as well as for "Earth-skimming" neutrino interactions in the case oftau neutrinos. In this paper the searches for downward-going neutrinos in thezenith angle bins $60^\circ-75^\circ$ and $75^\circ-90^\circ$ as well as forupward-going neutrinos, are combined to give a single limit. The $90\%$ C.L.single-flavor limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos with an$E^{-2}$ spectrum in the energy range $1.0 \times 10^{17}$ eV - $2.5 \times10^{19}$ eV is $E_\nu^2 dN_\nu/dE_\nu < 6.4 \times 10^{-9}~ {\rm GeV~ cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~ sr^{-1}}$.
