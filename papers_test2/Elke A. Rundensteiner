Summarization and Matching of Density-Based Clusters in Streaming  Environments

  Density-based cluster mining is known to serve a broad range of applicationsranging from stock trade analysis to moving object monitoring. Although methodsfor efficient extraction of density-based clusters have been studied in theliterature, the problem of summarizing and matching of such clusters witharbitrary shapes and complex cluster structures remains unsolved. Therefore,the goal of our work is to extend the state-of-art of density-based clustermining in streams from cluster extraction only to now also support analysis andmanagement of the extracted clusters. Our work solves three major technicalchallenges. First, we propose a novel multi-resolution cluster summarizationmethod, called Skeletal Grid Summarization (SGS), which captures the keyfeatures of density-based clusters, covering both their external shape andinternal cluster structures. Second, in order to summarize the extractedclusters in real-time, we present an integrated computation strategy C-SGS,which piggybacks the generation of cluster summarizations within the onlineclustering process. Lastly, we design a mechanism to efficiently executecluster matching queries, which identify similar clusters for given cluster ofanalyst's interest from clusters extracted earlier in the stream history. Ourexperimental study using real streaming data shows the clear superiority of ourproposed methods in both efficiency and effectiveness for cluster summarizationand cluster matching queries to other potential alternatives.
