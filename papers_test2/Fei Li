  The Li intercalation potential of LiMPO4 and LiMSiO4 compounds with M = Fe,Mn, Co, and Ni is computed with the GGA+U method. It is found that thisapproach is considerably more accurate than standard LDA or GGA methods. Thecalculated potentials for LiFePO4, LiMnPO4 and LiCoOPO4 agree to within 0.1 Vwith experimental results. The LiNiPO4 potential is predicted to be above 5 V.The potentials of the silicate materials are all found to be rather high, butLiFeSiO4 and LiCoSiO4 have negligible volume change upon Li extraction.

Online Maximizing Weighted Throughput In A Fading Channel

  We consider online scheduling weighted packets with time constraints over afading channel. Packets arrive at the transmitter in an online manner. Eachpacket has a value and a deadline by which it should be sent. The fade state ofthe channel determines the throughput obtained per unit of time and thechannel's quality may change over time. In this paper, we design onlinealgorithms to maximize weighted throughput, defined as the total value of thepackets sent by their respective deadlines. Competitive ratio is employed tomeasure an online algorithm's performance. For this problem and one of itsvariants, we present two online algorithms with competitive ratios 2.618 and 2respectively.

  Based on the mutually unbiased bases, the mutually unbiased measurements andthe general symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valuedmeasures, we propose three separability criteria for $d$-dimensional bipartitequantum systems, which are more powerful than the corresponding ones introducedin [C. Spengler, M. Huber, S. Brierley, T. Adaktylos, and B.C. Hiesmayr, Phys.Rev. A \textbf{86}, 022311 (2012); B. Chen, T. Ma, and S.M. Fei, Phys. Rev. A\textbf{89}, 064302 (2014); B. Chen, T. Li, and S.M. Fei, arXiv:1406.7820v1[quant-ph] (2014)]. Some states such as Werner states and Bell-diagonal statesare used to further illustrate the efficiency of the presented criteria.

On this basis, wesolve all the generalized Hamming weights of these linear codes.

Bayesian method for inferring the impact of geographical distance on  intensity of communication

  Both theoretical models and empirical findings suggest that the intensity ofcommunication among groups of people declines with their degree of geographicalseparation. There is some evidence that rather than decaying uniformly withdistance, the intensity of communication might decline at different rates forshorter and longer distances. Using Bayesian LASSO for model selection, weintroduce a statistical model for estimating the rate of communication declinewith geographic distance that allows for discontinuities in this rate. We applyour method to an anonymized mobile phone communication dataset. Our results arepotentially useful in settings where understanding social and spatial mixing ofpeople is important, such as in cluster randomized trials design.

  The Estrada index of a graph $G$ is defined as$EE(G)=\sum_{i=1}^ne^{\lambda_i}$, where $\lambda_1,$ $ \lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $G$. In this paper,we characterize the unique bipartite graph with maximum Estrada index amongbipartite graphs with given matching number and given vertex-connectivity,edge-connectivity, respectively.

Configurational electronic entropy and the phase diagram of  mixed-valence oxides: the case of Li$_x$FePO$_4$

  We demonstrate that configurational electronic entropy, previously neglected,in {\it ab initio} thermodynamics of materials can qualitatively modify thefinite-temperature phase stability of mixed-valence oxides. Whiletransformations from low-T ordered or immiscible states are almost alwaysdriven by configurational disorder (i.e. random occupation of lattice sites bymultiple species), in FePO$_4$--LiFePO$_4$ the formation of a solid solution isalmost entirely driven by electronic, rather than ionic configurationalentropy. We argue that such an electronic entropic mechanism may be relevant tomost other mixed-valence systems.

Hölder Continuity of the Solution for a Class of Nonlinear SPDE  Arising from One Dimensional Superprocesses

  The H\"older continuity of the solution to a nonlinear stochastic partialdifferential equation arising from one dimensional super process is obtained.It is proved that the H\"older exponent in time variable is as close as to 1/4,improving the result of 1/10 in a recent paper by Li et al [3]. The method isto use the Malliavin calculus. The H\"older continuity in spatial variable x ofexponent 1/2 is also obtained by using this new approach. This H\"oldercontinuity result is sharp since the corresponding linear heat equation has thesame H\"older continuity.

In termsof these mean values of quantum mechanical observables a measurable lower boundof the convex-roof extension of the negativity is derived.

  Determining the quantum circuit complexity of a unitary operation is animportant problem in quantum computation. By using the mathematical techniquesof Riemannian geometry, we investigate the efficient quantum circuits inquantum computation with $n$ qutrits. We show that the optimal quantum circuitsare essentially equivalent to the shortest path between two points in a certaincurved geometry of $SU(3^n)$. As an example, three-qutrit systems areinvestigated in detail.

The experimental realizations ofthese quantum gates are explicitly presented.

On the dynamics of a family of renormalization transformations

  We study the family of renormalization transformations of the generalized$d$--dimensional diamond hierarchical Potts model in statistical mechanic andprove that their Julia sets and non-escaping loci are always connected, where$d\geq 2$. In particular, we prove that their Julia sets can never be aSierpi\'{n}ski carpet if the parameter is real. We show that the Julia set is aquasicircle if and only if the parameter lies in the unbounded capture domainof these models. Moreover, the asymptotic formula of the Hausdorff dimension ofthe Julia set is calculated as the parameter tends to infinity.

Unextendible maximally entangled bases in dxd

  We investigate the unextendible maximally entangled bases in$\mathbb{C}^{d}\bigotimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$ and present a $30$-number UMEBconstruction in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\bigotimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$. For higherdimensional case, we show that for a given $N$-number UMEB in$\mathbb{C}^{d}\bigotimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$, there is a $\widetilde{N}$-number,$\widetilde{N}=(qd)^2-(d^2-N)$, UMEB in$\mathbb{C}^{qd}\bigotimes\mathbb{C}^{qd}$ for any $q\in\mathbb{N}$. As anexample, for $\mathbb{C}^{12n}\bigotimes\mathbb{C}^{12n}$ systems, we show thatthere are at least two sets of UMEBs which are not equivalent.

Towards Grothendieck Constants and LHV Models in Quantum Mechanics

  We adopt a continuous model to estimate the Grothendieck constants. Ananalytical formula to compute the lower bounds of Grothendieck constants hasbeen explicitly derived for arbitrary orders, which improves previous bounds.Moreover, our lower bound of the Grothendieck constant of order three gives arefined bound of the threshold value for the nonlocality of the two-qubitWerner states.

Quantum Nonlocality of Arbitrary Dimensional Bipartite States

  We study the nonlocality of arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum states.By computing the maximal violation of a set of multi-setting Bell inequalities,an analytical and computable lower bound has been derived for general two-qubitstates. This bound gives the necessary condition that a two-qubit state admitsno local hidden variable models. The lower bound is shown to be better thanthat from the CHSH inequality in judging the nonlocality of some quantumstates. The results are generalized to the case of high dimensional quantumstates, and a sufficient condition for detecting the non-locality has beenpresented.

On the Hessian of Shape Matching Energy

  In this technical report we derive the analytic form of the Hessian matrixfor shape matching energy. Shape matching is a useful technique for meshlessdeformation, which can be easily combined with multiple techniques in real-timedynamics. Nevertheless, it has been rarely applied in scenarios where implicitintegrators are required, and hence strong viscous damping effect, thoughpopular in simulation systems nowadays, is forbidden for shape matching. Thereason lies in the difficulty to derive the Hessian matrix of the shapematching energy. Computing the Hessian matrix correctly, and stably, is the keyto more broadly application of shape matching in implicitly-integrated systems.

Component-Enhanced Chinese Character Embeddings

  Distributed word representations are very useful for capturing semanticinformation and have been successfully applied in a variety of NLP tasks,especially on English. In this work, we innovatively develop twocomponent-enhanced Chinese character embedding models and their bigramextensions. Distinguished from English word embeddings, our models explore thecompositions of Chinese characters, which often serve as semantic indictorsinherently. The evaluations on both word similarity and text classificationdemonstrate the effectiveness of our models.

A Unified Stochastic Particle Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook Method for  Multiscale Gas Flows

  The stochastic particle method based on Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) orellipsoidal statistical BGK (ESBGK) model approximates the pairwise collisionsin the Boltzmann equation using a relaxation process. Therefore, it is moreefficient to simulate gas flows at small Knudsen numbers than the counterpartsbased on the original Boltzmann equation, such as the Direct Simulation MonteCarlo (DSMC) method. However, the traditional stochastic particle BGK methoddecouples the molecular motions and collisions in analogy to the DSMC method,and hence its transport properties deviate from physical values as the timestep increases. This defect significantly affects its computational accuracyand efficiency for the simulation of multiscale flows, especially when thetransport processes in the continuum regime is important. In the present paper,we propose a unified stochastic particle ESBGK (USP-ESBGK) method by combiningthe molecular convection and collision effects. In the continuum regime, theproposed method can be applied using large temporal-spatial discretization andapproaches to the Navier-Stokes solutions accurately. Furthermore, it iscapable to simulate both the small scale non-equilibrium flows and large scalecontinuum flows within a unified framework efficiently and accurately. Theapplications of USP-ESBGK method to a variety of benchmark problems, includingCouette flow, thermal Couette flow, Poiseuille flow, Sod tube flow, cavityflow, and flow through a slit, demonstrated that it is a promising tool tosimulate multiscale gas flows ranging from rarefied to continuum regime.
