Infinitely many non-radial sign-changing solutions for a Fractional  Laplacian equation with critical nonlinearity

  In this work, the following fractional Laplacian problem with pure criticalnonlinearity is considered \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}(-\Delta)^{s} u=|u|^{\frac{4s}{N-2s}}u, &\mbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \\ u\in\mathcal{D}^{s,2}(\mathbb{R}^N), \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where$s\in (0,1)$, $N$ is a positive integer with $N\geq 3$, $(-\Delta)^{s}$ is thefractional Laplacian operator. We will prove that this problem has infinitelymany non-radial sign-changing solutions.

FeII and FeI emission in IRAS 07598+6508 and PHL 1092

  One of the puzzles in understanding the spectra of active galactic nuclei(AGN) is the origin of the FeII emission. FeI emission, if present, will helpreveal the physical conditions of the emitting gas. In an attempt to verify thepresence of FeI lines, high S/N spectra of two FeII-strong quasars, IRAS07598-6508 and PHL 1092, were obtained at the Multiple Mirror Telescope and theSteward 2.3 m Telescope. We have identified emission lines of FeI and TiII. Thesource of energy for FeII, FeI and TiII emission is probably not fromionization by the photon continuum, but heat. The high rate of energygeneration and the presence of both high and low velocity gas indicate that theheat is generated not over a large area, but a narrow band in accretion disk,in which the rotational speed decreases rapidly.

Orlicz-Sobolev versus Holder local minimizer and multiplicity results  for quasilinear elliptic equations

  We study the following boundary value problem (P)\ \ \ \ \{-\mathrm{div}(a(|\nabla u|)\nabla u)=f(x,u),\ & in $\Omega$, u=0, & on$\partial\Omega$} with nonhomogeneous principal part. By assuming thenonlinearity $f(x, t)$ being subcritical growth, some abstract results ofproblem (P) are obtained: (1) Regularity; (2) Orlicz-Sobolev versus H\"{o}lderlocal minimizer; (3) Strong comparison principle. Applying these abstractresults and critical point theory, we prove the existence of multiple solutionsof problem (P) in an Orlicz-Sobolev space.

On SchrÃ¶dinger equations with periodic potentials and with nonperiodic  nonlinearities

  We consider the Schr\"{o}dinger equation $-\Delta u +V(x)u=f(x, u)$, where$V$ is periodic and $f$ is non-periodic, 0 is a boundary point of thecontinuous spectrum of $A:=-\Delta +V(x)$. We use M. Willem and W. M. Zou'slinking theorem and M. Schechter's method to establish an existence result forthis problem in weak superlinear cases. In a sense, we enrich a recent resultof M. Willem and W.M. Zou [M. Willem and W.M. Zou, On a Schr\"{o}dingerEquation with Periodic Potential and Spectrum Point Zero,Indiana Univ. Math. J.2003].

The cone Moser-Trudinger inequalities and theirapplications

  In this article, we firstly study the cone Moser-Trudinger inequalities andtheir best exponents $\alpha_2$ on both bounded and unbounded domains$\mathbb{R}^2_{+}$. Then, using the cone Moser-Trudinger inequalities, we studythe existence of weak solutions to the nonlinear equation \begin{equation*}\left\{\begin{array}{ll} -\Delta_{\mathbb{B}} u=f(x, u), &\mbox{in}\ x\in\mbox{int} (\mathbb{B}), \\ u= 0, &\mbox{on}\ \partial\mathbb{B}, \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $\Delta_{\mathbb{B}}$ is Fuchsian type Laplaceoperator investigated with totally characteristic degeneracy on the boundary$x_1 =0$, and the nonlinearity $f$ has the subcritical exponential growth orthe critical exponential growth.

Standing waves for the Chern-Simons-Schrodinger equation with critical  exponential growth

  In this paper, by combing the variational methods and Trudinger-Moserinequality, we study the existence and multiplicity of the positive standingwave for the following Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation}-\Delta u+u+\lambda\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{h(s)}{s}u^{2}(s)ds+\frac{h^{2}(\vertx\vert)}{\vert x\vert^{2}}\right)u=f(x,u)+\epsilon k(x)\quad\quad\text{in}\,\,\mathbb{R}^2, \\ \end{equation} where$h(s)=\int_{0}^{s}\frac{l}{2}u^{2}(l)dl$, $\lambda>0$ and the nonlinearity$f:\mathbb{R}^2\times \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ behaves like$\text{exp}(\alpha\vert u\vert^{2})$ as $\vert u\vert\rightarrow \infty$. Forthe case $\epsilon=0$, we can get a mountain-pass type solution.

The Decay Rate of Patterson-Sullivan Measures with Potential Functions  and Critical Exponents

  Basing upon the recent development of the Patterson-Sullivan measures with aH\"older continuous nonzero potential function, we use tools of both dynamicsof geodesic flows and geometric properties of negatively curved manifolds topresent a new formula illustrating the relation between the exponential decayrate of Patterson-Sullivan measures with a H\"older continuous potentialfunction and the corresponding critical exponent.

On the mixing and Bernoulli properties for geodesic flows on rank 1  manifolds without focal points

  If $(M,g)$ is a smooth compact rank $1$ Riemannian manifold without focalpoints, it is shown that the measure $\mu_{\max}$ of maximal entropy for thegeodesic flow is unique. In this article, we study the statistic properties andprove that this unique measure $\mu_{\max}$ is mixing. Stronger conclusion thatthe geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle $SM$ with respect to $\mu_{\max}$is Bernoulli is acquired provided $M$ is a compact surface with genus greaterthan one and no focal points.

Collective Motion of Inelastic Particles between Two Oscillating Walls

  This study theoretically considers the motion of N identical inelasticparticles between two oscillating walls. The particles' average energyincreases abruptly at certain critical filling fractions, wherein the systemchanges into a solid-like phase with particles clustered in their compact form.Molecular dynamics simulations of the system show that the critical fillingfraction is a decreasing function of vibration amplitude independent ofvibration frequency, which is consistent with previous experimental results.This study considers the entire group of particles as a giant pseudo-particlewith an effective size and an effective coefficient of restitution. TheN-particles system is then analytically treated as a one-particle problem. Thecritical filling fraction's dependence on vibration amplitude can be explainedas a necessary condition for a stable resonant solution. The fluctuation to thesystem's mean flow energy is also studied to show the relation between thegranular temperature and the system phase.

Nontrivial solutions for semilinear elliptic systems via Orlicz-Sobolev  theory

  In this paper, the semilinear elliptic systems with Dirichlet boundary valueare considered \begin{align} \left\{\begin{array}{ll}  -\Delta v=f(u) & \mathrm{in}\ \Omega,  -\Delta u=g(v) & \mathrm{in}\ \Omega, u=0, \ v=0 & \mathrm{on}\\partial\Omega, \end{array} \right. \end{align}  We extend the notion of subcritical growth from polynomial growth toN-function growth. Under N-function growth, nontrivial solutions are obtainedvia Orlicz-Sobolev spaces and variational methods. It's also noteworthy thatthe nonlinear term $g(v)$ does not have to satisfy the usualAmbrosetti-Rabinowitz condition. So, in a sense, we enrich recent results of D.~G. de Figueiredo, J. ~M. do {\'O} and B. ~Ruf [D. ~G. de Figueiredo, J.M. do{\'O}, B. ~Ruf, An {O}rlicz-space approach to superlinear elliptic systems, J.Funct. Anal. 224 (2005) 471--496].

The energy identity of Sacks-Uhlenbeck operator and infinitely many  solutions for Brezis-Nirenberg problem

  Let $\Omega$ be a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\geq 3$,$1<\alpha$, $2^{\ast}=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ and $\{u_\alpha\}\subsetH_{0}^{1,2\alpha}(\Omega)$ be a critical point of the functional\begin{equation*} I_{\alpha,\lambda}(u)=\frac{1}{2\alpha}\int\limits_{\Omega}[(1+|\nabla u|^2)^{\alpha}-1]dx-\frac{\lambda}{2}\int\limits_{\Omega}u^2dx-\frac{1}{2^{\ast}}\int\limits_{\Omega}|u|^{2^{\ast}}dx.\end{equation*} In this paper, we obtain the limit behaviour of $u_\alpha$ ($\alpha\rightarrow 1$), energy identity, Pohozaev identity, some integralestimates, etc. And using these results, we prove infinitely many solutions forthe following Brezis-Nirenberg problem for $N\geq 7$: \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned}  &-\Delta u=|u|^{2^{\ast}-2}u+\lambda u\ \ \ \mbox{in}\ \Omega,\\ &u=0,\ \\mbox{on}\ \partial\Omega. \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*}

Field-induced Domain Reorientation and Polarization Rotation of <110>  Oriented Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 Single Crystals

  Polarization hysteresis loops, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperaturedependent dielectric constant under different electric fields for <110>oriented 0.7 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.3PbTiO3 single crystals were measured. Thefield-induced phase transition and the process of depolarization werediscussed. The results show that with the electric field increasing, thecrystal form changes along via polar-axis reorientation and polarizationrotation. However, the depolarization process is not just the reversal of thepolarization process. It is noticed that just from the temperature dependentdielectric behavior is not enough to judge the processes of the E-field inducedphase transition.

Experimental Implementaton of Dense Coding Using Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance

  Quantum dense coding has been demonstrated experimentally in terms of quantumlogic gates and circuits in quantum computation and NMR technique. Two bits ofinformation have been transmitted through manipulating one of the maximallyentangled two-state quantum pair, which is completely consistent with theoriginal ideal of Bennett-Wiesner proposal. Although information transmissionhappens between spins over inter-atomic distance, the scheme of entanglementtransformation and measurement can be used in other processes of quantuminformation and quantum computing.

Experimental realization of a highly structured search algorithm

  The highly structured search algorithm proposed by Hogg[Phys.Rev.Lett.80,2473(1998)] is implemented experimentally for the 1-SAT problem in a singlesearch step by using nuclear magnetic resonance technique with two-qubitsample. It is the first demonstration of the Hogg's algorithm, and can bereadily extended to solving 1-SAT problem for more qubits in one step if theappropriate samples possessing more qubits are experimentally feasible.

On the ergodicity of geodesic flows on surfaces without focal points

  In this article, we study the ergodicity of the geodesic flows on surfaceswith no focal points. Let $M$ be a smooth connected and closed surface equippedwith a $C^\infty$ Riemannian metric $g$, whose genus $\mathfrak{g} \geq 2$.Suppose that $(M,g)$ has no focal points. We prove that the geodesic flow onthe unit tangent bundle of $M$ is ergodic with respect to the Liouvillemeasure, under the assumption that the set of points on $M$ with negativecurvature has at most finitely many connected components.

Electrical homogeneity of large-area chemical vapor deposited multilayer  hexagonal boron nitride sheets

  Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a two dimensional (2D) layered insulatorwith superior dielectric performance that offers excellent interaction withother 2D materials (e.g. graphene, MoS2). Large-area h-BN can be readily grownon metallic substrates via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), but the impact oflocal inhomogeneities on the electrical properties of the h-BN and their effectin electronic devices is unknown. Here it is shown that the electricalproperties of h-BN stacks grown on polycrystalline Pt vary a lot depending onthe crystalline orientation of the Pt grain, but within the same grain theelectrical properties of the h-BN are very homogeneous. The reason is that thethickness of the CVD-grown h-BN stack is different on each Pt grain. Conductiveatomic force microscopy (CAFM) maps show that the tunneling current across theh-BN stack fluctuates up to 3 orders of magnitude from one Pt grain to another.However, probe station experiments reveal that the variability of electronicdevices fabricated within the same Pt grain is surprisingly small. Ascutting-edge electronic devices are ultra-scaled, and as the size of themetallic substrate grains can easily exceed 100 {\mu}m (in diameter), CVD-grownh-BN stacks may be useful to fabricate electronic devices with low variability.

Superconductivity at 22.3 K in SrFe2-xIrxAs2

  By substituting the Fe with the 5d-transition metal Ir in SrFe2As2, we havesuccessfully synthesized the superconductor SrFe2-xIrxAs2 with Tc = 22.3 K at x= 0.5. X-ray diffraction indicates that the material has formed theThCr2Si2-type structure with a space group I4/mmm. The temperature dependenceof resistivity and dc magnetization both reveal sharp superconductingtransitions at around 22 K. An estimate on the diamagnetization signal revealsa high Meissner shielding volume. Interestingly, the normal state resistivityexhibits a roughly linear behavior up to 300 K. The superconducting transitionsat different magnetic fields were also measured yielding a slope of -dHc2/dT =3.8 T/K near Tc. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula, the uppercritical field at zero K is found to be about 58 T. Counting the possiblenumber of electrons doped into the system in SrFe2-xIrxAs2, we argue that thesuperconductivity in the Ir-doped system is different from the Co-doped case,which should add more ingredients to the underlying physics of the ironpnictide superconductors.

Superconductivity and phase diagrams in 4d- and 5d-metal-doped iron  arsenides SrFe_{2-x}M_xAs_2 (M = Rh, Ir, Pd)

  By substituting the Fe with the 4d and 5d-transition metals Rh, Ir and Pd inSrFe_2As_2, we have successfully synthesized a series of superconductorsSrFe_{2-x}M_xAs_2 (M = Rh, Ir and Pd) and explored the phase diagrams of them.The systematic evolution of the lattice constants indicated that part of the Feions were successfully replaced by the transition metals Rh, Ir and Pd. Byincreasing the doping content of Rh, Ir and Pd, the antiferromagnetic state ofthe parent phase is suppressed progressively and superconductivity is induced.The general phase diagrams were obtained and found to be similar to the case ofdoping Co and Ni to the Fe sites. However, the detailed structure of the phasediagram, in terms of how fast to suppress the antiferromagnetic order andinduce the superconductivity, varies from one kind of doped element to another.Regarding the close values of the maximum superconducting transitiontemperatures in doping Co, Rh and Ir which locate actually in the same columnin the periodic table of elements but have very different masses, we argue thatthe superconductivity is intimately related to the suppression of the AF order,rather than the electron-phonon coupling.

Poisson Vector Graphics (PVG) and Its Closed-Form Solver

  This paper presents Poisson vector graphics, an extension of the popularfirst-order diffusion curves, for generating smooth-shaded images. Armed withtwo new types of primitives, namely Poisson curves and Poisson regions, PVG caneasily produce photorealistic effects such as specular highlights, coreshadows, translucency and halos. Within the PVG framework, users specify coloras the Dirichlet boundary condition of diffusion curves and control tone byoffsetting the Laplacian, where both controls are simply done by mouse clickand slider dragging. The separation of color and tone not only follows thebasic drawing principle that is widely adopted by professional artists, butalso brings three unique features to PVG, i.e., local hue change, ease ofextrema control, and permit of intersection among geometric primitives, makingPVG an ideal authoring tool.  To render PVG, we develop an efficient method to solve 2D Poisson's equationswith piecewise constant Laplacians. In contrast to the conventional finiteelement method that computes numerical solutions only, our method expresses thesolution using harmonic B-spline, whose basis functions can be constructedlocally and the control coefficients are obtained by solving a small sparselinear system. Our closed-form solver is numerically stable and it supportsrandom access evaluation, zooming-in of arbitrary resolution and anti-aliasing.Although the harmonic B-spline based solutions are approximate, computationalresults show that the relative mean error is less than 0.3%, which cannot bedistinguished by naked eyes.

Spin-orbit gap of graphene: First-principles calculations

  Even though graphene is a low energy system consisting of the two dimensionalhoneycomb lattice of carbon atoms, its quasi-particle excitations are fullydescribed by the 2+1 dimensional relativistic Dirac equation. In this paper weshow that while the spin-orbit interaction in graphene is of the order of $4meV$, it opens up a gap of the order of $10^{-3} meV$ at the Dirac points. Wepresent the first principle calculation of the spin-orbit gap, and explain thebehavior in terms of a simple tight-binding model. Our result also shows thatthe recently predicted quantum spin Hall effect in graphene can only occur atunrealistically low temperature.

Experimental Test of Complementarity by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  Techniques

  We have tested complementarity for the ensemble-averaged spin states ofnuclei $^{13}$C in the molecule of $^{13}$CHCl$_{3}$ by the use of the spinstates of another nuclei $^{1}$H as the path marker. It turns out that thewave-particle duality holds when one merely measures the probability density ofquantum states, and that the wave- and particle-like behavior is simultaneouslyobserved with the help of measuring populations and coherence in a singlenuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) experiment. Effects of path-marking schemes andcauses of the appearance and disappearance of the wave behavior are analysed.

On-chip three-dimensional high-Q microcavities fabricated by femtosecond  laser direct writing

  We report on the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) high-Q whisperinggallery microcavities on a fused silica chip by femtosecond lasermicrofabriction, enabled by the 3D nature of femtosecond laser direct writing.The processing mainly consists of formation of freestanding microdisks byfemtosecond laser direct writing and subsequent wet chemical etching. CO2 laserannealing is followed to smooth the microcavity surface. Microcavities witharbitrary tilting angle, lateral and vertical positioning are demonstrated, andthe quality (Q)-factor of a typical microcavity is measured to be up to1.07x10^6, which is currently limited by the low spatial resolution of motionstage used during the laser patterning and can be improved with motion stagesof higher resolutions.

Low-threshold whispering-gallery-mode microlasers fabricated in a Nd:  glass substrate by three-dimensional femtosecond laser micromachining

  We report on fabrication of whispering-gallery-mode microlasers in a Nd:glasschip by femtosecond laser three-dimensional (3D) micromachining. Mainfabrication procedures include the fabrication of freestanding microdiskssupported by thin pillars by femtosecond laser ablation of the glass substrateimmersed in water, followed by CO2 laser annealing for surface smoothing.Lasing is observed at a pump threshold as low as ~69 {\mu}W at room temperaturewith a continuous-wave laser diode operating at 780nm. This technique allowsfor fabrication of microcavities of high quality factors in various dielectricmaterials such as glasses and crystals.

Fabrication of three-dimensional microdisk resonators in calcium  fluoride by femtosecond laser micromachining

  We report on fabrication of on-chip calcium fluoride (CaF2) microdiskresonators using water-assisted femtosecond laser micromachining. Focused ionbeam (FIB) milling is used to create ultra-smooth sidewalls. The quality(Q)-factors of the fabricated microresonators are measured to be 4.2x10^4 atwavelengths near 1550 nm. The Q factor is mainly limited by the scattering fromthe bottom surface of the disk whose roughness remains high due to thefemtosecond laser micromachining process. This technique facilitates formationof on-chip microresonators on various kinds of bulk crystalline materials,which can benefit a wide range of applications such as nonlinear optics,quantum optics, and chip-level integration of photonic devices.

The effect of heterogeneity on flocking behavior and systemic risk

  The goal of this paper is to study organized flocking behavior and systemicrisk in heterogeneous mean-field interacting diffusions. We illustrate in anumber of case studies the effect of heterogeneity in the behavior of systemicrisk in the system, i.e., the risk that several agents default simultaneouslyas a result of interconnections. We also investigate the effect ofheterogeneity on the "flocking behavior" of different agents, i.e., when agentswith different dynamics end up following very similar paths and follow closelythe mean behavior of the system. Using Laplace asymptotics, we derive anasymptotic formula for the tail of the loss distribution as the number ofagents grows to infinity. This characterizes the tail of the loss distributionand the effect of the heterogeneity of the network on the tail lossprobability.

Direct identification of monolayer rhenium diselenide by an individual  diffraction pattern

  In the current extensive studies of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),compared to hexagonal layered materials, like graphene, hBN and MoS2, lowsymmetry layered 2D crystals showed great potential for applications inanisotropic devices. Rhenium diselenide (ReSe2) has the bulk space group P1 andbelongs to triclinic crystal system with a deformed cadmium iodide typestructure. Here we unambiguously determined monolayer and its verticalorientation of rhenium diselenide membrane with an individual electrondiffraction pattern, which could be applicable to low symmetry crystal systems,including both triclinic and monoclinic lattices, as long as their thirdunit-cell basis vector is not perpendicular to basal plane. Atomically resolvedimage from probe corrected annular dark field scanning transmission electronmicroscope (ADF-STEM) was employed to validate layer number. Finally,experimental results were well explained by kinematical electron diffractiontheory and corresponding simulations.

Long-Term Ensemble Learning of Visual Place Classifiers

  This paper addresses the problem of cross-season visual place classification(VPC) from a novel perspective of long-term map learning. Our goal is to enabletransfer learning efficiently from one season to the next, at a small constantcost, and without wasting the robot's available long-term-memory by memorizingvery large amounts of training data. To realize a good tradeoff betweengeneralization and specialization abilities, we employ an ensemble ofconvolutional neural network (DCN) classifiers and consider the task ofscheduling (when and which classifiers to retrain), given a previous season'sDCN classifiers as the sole prior knowledge. We present a unified framework forretraining scheduling and discuss practical implementation strategies.Furthermore, we address the task of partitioning a robot's workspace intoplaces to define place classes in an unsupervised manner, rather than usinguniform partitioning, so as to maximize VPC performance. Experiments using thepublicly available NCLT dataset revealed that retraining scheduling of a DCNclassifier ensemble is crucial and performance is significantly increased byusing planned scheduling.

Spatio-Temporal Pricing for Ridesharing Platforms

  Ridesharing platforms match drivers and riders to trips, using dynamic pricesto balance supply and demand. A challenge is to set prices that areappropriately smooth in space and time, so that drivers will choose to accepttheir dispatched trips, rather than drive to another area or wait for higherprices or a better trip. We work in a complete information, discrete time,multi-period, multi-location model, and introduce the Spatio-Temporal Pricing(STP) mechanism. The mechanism is incentive-aligned, in that it is asubgame-perfect equilibrium for drivers to accept their dispatches. Themechanism is also welfare-optimal, envy-free, individually rational, budgetbalanced and core-selecting from any history onward. The proof of incentivealignment makes use of the $M^\natural$ concavity of min-cost flow objectives.We also give an impossibility result, that there can be no dominant-strategymechanism with the same economic properties. An empirical analysis conducted insimulation suggests that the STP mechanism can achieve significantly highersocial welfare than a myopic pricing mechanism.

Designing the Game to Play: Optimizing Payoff Structure in Security  Games

  Effective game-theoretic modeling of defender-attacker behavior is becomingincreasingly important. In many domains, the defender functions not only as aplayer but also the designer of the game's payoff structure. We studyStackelberg Security Games where the defender, in addition to allocatingdefensive resources to protect targets from the attacker, can strategicallymanipulate the attacker's payoff under budget constraints in weighted L^p-normform regarding the amount of change. Focusing on problems with weightedL^1-norm form constraint, we present (i) a mixed integer linear program-basedalgorithm with approximation guarantee; (ii) a branch-and-bound based algorithmwith improved efficiency achieved by effective pruning; (iii) a polynomial timeapproximation scheme for a special but practical class of problems. Inaddition, we show that problems under budget constraints in L^0-norm form andweighted L^\infty-norm form can be solved in polynomial time. We provide anextensive experimental evaluation of our proposed algorithms.

The Impact of Humanoid Affect Expression on Human Behavior in a  Game-Theoretic Setting

  With the rapid development of robot and other intelligent and autonomousagents, how a human could be influenced by a robot's expressed mood when makingdecisions becomes a crucial question in human-robot interaction. In this pilotstudy, we investigate (1) in what way a robot can express a certain mood toinfluence a human's decision making behavioral model; (2) how and to whatextent the human will be influenced in a game theoretic setting. Morespecifically, we create an NLP model to generate sentences that adhere to aspecific affective expression profile. We use these sentences for a humanoidrobot as it plays a Stackelberg security game against a human. We investigatethe behavioral model of the human player.

Tractable Graph Matching via Soft Seeding

  The graph matching problem aims to discover a latent correspondence betweenthe vertex sets of two observed graphs. This problem has proven to be quitechallenging, with few satisfying methods that are computationally tractable andwidely applicable. The FAQ algorithm has proven to have good performance onbenchmark problems and works with a indefinite relaxation of the problem. Dueto the indefinite relaxation, FAQ is not guaranteed to find the global maximum.However, if prior information is known about the true correspondence, this canbe leveraged to initialize the algorithm near the truth. We show that givencertain properties of this initial matrix, with high probability the FAQalgorithm will converge in two steps to the truth under a flexible model forpairs of random graphs. Importantly, this result implies that there will be nolocal optima near the global optima, providing a method to assess performance.

The intrinsic relations of quantum resources in multiparticle systems

  Quantum resources play crucial roles for displaying superiority in manyquantum communication and computation tasks. To reveal the intrinsic relationshidden in these quantum resources, many efforts have been made in recent years.In this work, we investigate the correlations of the tripartite W-type statesbased on bipartite quantum resources. The interrelations among the degree ofcoherence, concurrence, Bell nonlocality and purity are presented. ConsideringBell nonlocal and Bell local (satisfied the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holtinequality) states for the two-qubit subsystems derived from the tripartiteW-type states, we find exact lower and upper boundaries of the degree ofcoherence versus concurrence. Interestingly, exact relation among the degree ofcoherence, concurrence and purity is obtained. Moreover, coherence is alsoclosely related to entanglement in two specific scenarios: the tripartiteW-type state under decoherence and a practical system for a renormalizedspin-1/2 chain.

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Green Security Games with Real-Time  Information

  Green Security Games (GSGs) have been proposed and applied to optimizepatrols conducted by law enforcement agencies in green security domains such ascombating poaching, illegal logging and overfishing. However, real-timeinformation such as footprints and agents' subsequent actions upon receivingthe information, e.g., rangers following the footprints to chase the poacher,have been neglected in previous work. To fill the gap, we first propose a newgame model GSG-I which augments GSGs with sequential movement and the vitalelement of real-time information. Second, we design a novel deep reinforcementlearning-based algorithm, DeDOL, to compute a patrolling strategy that adaptsto the real-time information against a best-responding attacker. DeDOL is builtupon the double oracle framework and the policy-space response oracle, solvinga restricted game and iteratively adding best response strategies to it throughtraining deep Q-networks. Exploring the game structure, DeDOL usesdomain-specific heuristic strategies as initial strategies and constructsseveral local modes for efficient and parallelized training. To our knowledge,this is the first attempt to use Deep Q-Learning for security games.

On the Patterson-Sullivan measure for geodesic flows on rank $1$  manifolds without focal points

  In this article, we consider the geodesic flow on a compact rank $1$Riemannian manifold $M$ without focal points, whose universal cover is denotedby $X$. On the ideal boundary $X(\infty)$ of $X$, we show the existence anduniqueness of the Busemann density, which is realized via thePatterson-Sullivan measure. Based on the the Patterson-Sullivan measure, weshow that the geodesic flow on $M$ has a unique invariant measure of maximalentropy. We also obtain the asymptotic growth rate of the volume of geodesicspheres in $X$ and the growth rate of the number of closed geodesics on $M$.These results generalize the work of Margulis and Knieper in the case ofnegative and nonpositive curvature respectively.

Towards Thwarting Social Engineering Attacks

  Social engineering attacks represent an increasingly important attack vectorgrowing in use by sophisticated hackers to compromise organizations. Water-holeattacks, in particular, have been leveraged in many recent high profile hacks.These attacks compromise a legitimate website to execute drive-by downloadattacks by redirecting users to another domain with an exploit kit. To preventwater-hole attacks, organizations use a slew of countermeasures that alter theenvironment information given by employees visiting websites. In this paper, weexplore this domain and introduce a game-theoretic model that captures the mostrelevant aspects for an organization protecting itself from a water-holeattack. This model provides a foundation for an organization to implement anautomated protection policy that uses technological based countermeasures. Ourmain contributions are (1) the Social Engineering Deception Game model, (2)detailed analysis of the game model, (3) an algorithm to solve for the optimalprotection policy, (4) heuristics to improve the scalability of our approach,and (5) detailed experiments that analyze the application of our approach.

Artificial Intelligence for Social Good

  The Computing Community Consortium (CCC), along with the White House Officeof Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the Association for theAdvancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), co-sponsored a public workshopon Artificial Intelligence for Social Good on June 7th, 2016 in Washington, DC.This was one of five workshops that OSTP co-sponsored and held around thecountry to spur public dialogue on artificial intelligence, machine learning,and to identify challenges and opportunities related to AI. In the AI forSocial Good workshop, the successful deployments and the potential use of AI invarious topics that are essential for social good were discussed, including butnot limited to urban computing, health, environmental sustainability, andpublic welfare. This report highlights each of these as well as a number ofcrosscutting issues.

Feature Learning Viewpoint of AdaBoost and a New Algorithm

  The AdaBoost algorithm has the superiority of resisting overfitting.Understanding the mysteries of this phenomena is a very fascinating fundamentaltheoretical problem. Many studies are devoted to explaining it from statisticalview and margin theory. In this paper, we illustrate it from feature learningviewpoint, and propose the AdaBoost+SVM algorithm, which can explain theresistant to overfitting of AdaBoost directly and easily to understand.Firstly, we adopt the AdaBoost algorithm to learn the base classifiers. Then,instead of directly weighted combination the base classifiers, we regard themas features and input them to SVM classifier. With this, the new coefficientand bias can be obtained, which can be used to construct the final classifier.We explain the rationality of this and illustrate the theorem that when thedimension of these features increases, the performance of SVM would not beworse, which can explain the resistant to overfitting of AdaBoost.

High-throughput, high-resolution registration-free generated adversarial  network microscopy

  We combine generative adversarial network (GAN) with light microscopy toachieve deep learning super-resolution under a large field of view (FOV). Byappropriately adopting prior microscopy data in an adversarial training, theneural network can recover a high-resolution, accurate image of new specimenfrom its single low-resolution measurement. Its capacity has been broadlydemonstrated via imaging various types of samples, such as USAF resolutiontarget, human pathological slides, fluorescence-labelled fibroblast cells, anddeep tissues in transgenic mouse brain, by both wide-field and light-sheetmicroscopes. The gigapixel, multi-color reconstruction of these samplesverifies a successful GAN-based single image super-resolution procedure. Wealso propose an image degrading model to generate low resolution images fortraining, making our approach free from the complex image registration duringtraining dataset preparation. After a welltrained network being created, thisdeep learning-based imaging approach is capable of recovering a large FOV (~95mm2), high-resolution (~1.7 {\mu}m) image at high speed (within 1 second),while not necessarily introducing any changes to the setup of existingmicroscopes.

Electronic structure of FeS

  Here we report the electronic structure of FeS, a recently identifiediron-based superconductor. Our high-resolution angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy studies show two hole-like ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) and twoelectron-like ($\eta$ and $\delta$) Fermi pockets around the Brillouin zonecenter and corner, respectively, all of which exhibit moderate dispersion along$k_z$. However, a third hole-like band ($\gamma$) is not observed, which isexpected around the zone center from band calculations and is common iniron-based superconductors. Since this band has the highest renormalizationfactor and is known to be the most vulnerable to defects, its absence in ourdata is likely due to defect scattering --- and yet superconductivity can existwithout coherent quasiparticles in the $\gamma$ band. This may help resolve thecurrent controversy on the superconducting gap structure of FeS. Moreover, bycomparing the $\beta$ bandwidths of various iron chalcogenides, including FeS,FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, FeSe, and FeSe$_{1-x}$ Te$_x$, we find that the $\beta$bandwidth of FeS is the broadest. However, the band renormalization factor ofFeS is still quite large, when compared with the band calculations, whichindicates sizable electron correlations. This explains why the unconventionalsuperconductivity can persist over such a broad range of isovalent substitutionin FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.

Video Labeling for Automatic Video Surveillance in Security Domains

  Beyond traditional security methods, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) havebecome an important surveillance tool used in security domains to collect therequired annotated data. However, collecting annotated data from videos takenby UAVs efficiently, and using these data to build datasets that can be usedfor learning payoffs or adversary behaviors in game-theoretic approaches andsecurity applications, is an under-explored research question. This paperpresents VIOLA, a novel labeling application that includes (i) a workloaddistribution framework to efficiently gather human labels from videos in asecured manner; (ii) a software interface with features designed for labelingvideos taken by UAVs in the domain of wildlife security. We also present theevolution of VIOLA and analyze how the changes made in the development processrelate to the efficiency of labeling, including when seemingly obviousimprovements did not lead to increased efficiency. VIOLA enables collectingmassive amounts of data with detailed information from challenging securityvideos such as those collected aboard UAVs for wildlife security. VIOLA willlead to the development of new approaches that integrate deep learning forreal-time detection and response.

What game are we playing? End-to-end learning in normal and extensive  form games

  Although recent work in AI has made great progress in solving large,zero-sum, extensive-form games, the underlying assumption in most past work isthat the parameters of the game itself are known to the agents. This paperdeals with the relatively under-explored but equally important "inverse"setting, where the parameters of the underlying game are not known to allagents, but must be learned through observations. We propose a differentiable,end-to-end learning framework for addressing this task. In particular, weconsider a regularized version of the game, equivalent to a particular form ofquantal response equilibrium, and develop 1) a primal-dual Newton method forfinding such equilibrium points in both normal and extensive form games; and 2)a backpropagation method that lets us analytically compute gradients of allrelevant game parameters through the solution itself. This ultimately lets uslearn the game by training in an end-to-end fashion, effectively by integratinga "differentiable game solver" into the loop of larger deep networkarchitectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning method inseveral settings including poker and security game tasks.

Exploiting Data and Human Knowledge for Predicting Wildlife Poaching

  Poaching continues to be a significant threat to the conservation of wildlifeand the associated ecosystem. Estimating and predicting where the poachers havecommitted or would commit crimes is essential to more effective allocation ofpatrolling resources. The real-world data in this domain is often sparse, noisyand incomplete, consisting of a small number of positive data (poaching signs),a large number of negative data with label uncertainty, and an even largernumber of unlabeled data. Fortunately, domain experts such as rangers canprovide complementary information about poaching activity patterns. However,this kind of human knowledge has rarely been used in previous approaches. Inthis paper, we contribute new solutions to the predictive analysis of poachingpatterns by exploiting both very limited data and human knowledge. We proposean approach to elicit quantitative information from domain experts through aquestionnaire built upon a clustering-based division of the conservation area.In addition, we propose algorithms that exploit qualitative and quantitativeinformation provided by the domain experts to augment the dataset and improvelearning. In collaboration with World Wild Fund for Nature, we show thatincorporating human knowledge leads to better predictions in a conservationarea in Northeastern China where the charismatic species is Siberian Tiger. Theresults show the importance of exploiting human knowledge when learning fromlimited data.

On the Inducibility of Stackelberg Equilibrium for Security Games

  Strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) is the standard solution concept ofStackelberg security games. As opposed to the weak Stackelberg equilibrium(WSE), the SSE assumes that the follower breaks ties in favor of the leader andthis is widely acknowledged and justified by the assertion that the defendercan often induce the attacker to choose a preferred action by making aninfinitesimal adjustment to her strategy. Unfortunately, in security games withresource assignment constraints, the assertion might not be valid; it ispossible that the defender cannot induce the desired outcome. As a result, manyresults claimed in the literature may be overly optimistic. To remedy, we firstformally define the utility guarantee of a defender strategy and provideexamples to show that the utility of SSE can be higher than its utilityguarantee. Second, inspired by the analysis of leader's payoff by Von Stengeland Zamir (2004), we provide the solution concept called the inducibleStackelberg equilibrium (ISE), which owns the highest utility guarantee andalways exists. Third, we show the conditions when ISE coincides with SSE andthe fact that in general case, SSE can be extremely worse with respect toutility guarantee. Moreover, introducing the ISE does not invalidate existingalgorithmic results as the problem of computing an ISE polynomially reduces tothat of computing an SSE. We also provide an algorithmic implementation forcomputing ISE, with which our experiments unveil the empirical advantage of theISE over the SSE.

Large Scale Learning of Agent Rationality in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games

  With the recent advances in solving large, zero-sum extensive form games,there is a growing interest in the inverse problem of inferring underlying gameparameters given only access to agent actions. Although a recent work providesa powerful differentiable end-to-end learning frameworks which embed a gamesolver within a deep-learning framework, allowing unknown game parameters to belearned via backpropagation, this framework faces significant limitations whenapplied to boundedly rational human agents and large scale problems, leading topoor practicality. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose aframework that is applicable for more practical settings. First, seeking tolearn the rationality of human agents in complex two-player zero-sum games, wedraw upon well-known ideas in decision theory to obtain a concise andinterpretable agent behavior model, and derive solvers and gradients forend-to-end learning. Second, to scale up to large, real-world scenarios, wepropose an efficient first-order primal-dual method which exploits thestructure of extensive-form games, yielding significantly faster computationfor both game solving and gradient computation. When tested on randomlygenerated games, we report speedups of orders of magnitude over previousapproaches. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on bothreal-world one-player settings and synthetic data.

Entanglement of two quantum memories via metropolitan-scale fibers

  Quantum internet will enable a number of revolutionary applications, such asdistributed quantum computing, large-scale quantum communication andcooperative operation of atomic clocks. It relies on entanglement of remotequantum memories over long distances. Yet, maximal reported distance achievedso far was merely about 1 km and experimental challenges for long distanceremains. Here, by using cavity enhancement to create bright atom-photonentanglement and harnessing quantum frequency conversion to shift the atomicwavelength to telecom, we create atom-atom entanglement over 22 kmfield-deployed fibers via two-photon interference. Moreover, by exploiting aconcatenated phase-locking scheme, we use single-photon interference toentangle two atomic ensembles by transmission over 50 km coiled fibers. Ourwork demonstrates full-functional segments for atomic quantum networks atmetropolitan scale, and pave the way towards establishing atomic entanglementover many nodes and over much longer distance in a scalable way.

Millimeter Spectral Line Mapping Observations Toward Four Massive Star  Forming HII Regions

  We present spectral line mapping observations toward four massivestar-forming regions (Cepheus A, DR21S, S76E and G34.26+0.15), with the IRAM 30meter telescope at 2 mm and 3 mm bands. Totally 396 spectral lines from 51molecules, one helium recombination line, ten hydrogen recombination lines, and16 unidentified lines were detected in these four sources. An emission line ofnitrosyl cyanide (ONCN, 14$_{0,14}$-13$_{0,13}$) was detected in G34.26+0.15,as first detection in massive star-forming regions. We found that the$c$-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ and NH$_{2}$D show enhancement in shocked regions assuggested by evidences of SiO and/or SO emission. Column density and rotationaltemperature of CH$_{3}$CN were estimated with the rotational diagram method forall four sources. Isotope abundance ratios of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C were derivedusing HC$_{3}$N and its $^{13}$C isotopologue, which were around 40 in all fourmassive star-forming regions and slightly lower than the local interstellarvalue ($\sim$65). $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O abundance ratios inthese sources were also derived using double isotopic method, which wereslightly lower than that in local interstellar medium. Except for Cep A,$^{33}$S/$^{34}$S ratio in the other three targets were derived, which weresimilar to that in the local interstellar medium. The column density ratios ofN(DCN)/N(HCN) and N(DCO$^{+}$)/N(HCO$^{+}$) in these sources were more than twoorders of magnitude higher than the elemental [D]/[H] ratio, which is1.5$\times$10$ ^{-5}$. Our results show the later stage sources, G34.26+0.15 inparticular, present more molecular species than earlier stage ones. Evidence ofshock activity is seen in all stages studied.
