Learning Time Series Detection Models from Temporally Imprecise Labels

  In this paper, we consider a new low-quality label learning problem: learningtime series detection models from temporally imprecise labels. In this problem,the data consist of a set of input time series, and supervision is provided bya sequence of noisy time stamps corresponding to the occurrence of positiveclass events. Such temporally imprecise labels commonly occur in areas likemobile health research where human annotators are tasked with labeling theoccurrence of very short duration events. We propose a general learningframework for this problem that can accommodate different base classifiers andnoise models. We present results on real mobile health data showing that theproposed framework significantly outperforms a number of alternatives includingassuming that the label time stamps are noise-free, transforming the probleminto the multiple instance learning framework, and learning on labels that weremanually re-aligned.

Modeling Irregularly Sampled Clinical Time Series

  While the volume of electronic health records (EHR) data continues to grow,it remains rare for hospital systems to capture dense physiological datastreams, even in the data-rich intensive care unit setting. Instead, typicalEHR records consist of sparse and irregularly observed multivariate timeseries, which are well understood to present particularly challenging problemsfor machine learning methods. In this paper, we present a new deep learningarchitecture for addressing this problem based on the use of a semi-parametricinterpolation network followed by the application of a prediction network. Theinterpolation network allows for information to be shared across multipledimensions during the interpolation stage, while any standard deep learningmodel can be used for the prediction network. We investigate the performance ofthis architecture on the problems of mortality and length of stay prediction.

Integrating Propositional and Relational Label Side Information for  Hierarchical Zero-Shot Image Classification

  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is one of the most extreme forms of learning fromscarce labeled data. It enables predicting that images belong to classes forwhich no labeled training instances are available. In this paper, we present anew ZSL framework that leverages both label attribute side information and asemantic label hierarchy. We present two methods, lifted zero-shot predictionand a custom conditional random field (CRF) model, that integrate both forms ofside information. We propose benchmark tasks for this framework that focus onmaking predictions across a range of semantic levels. We show that liftedzero-shot prediction can dramatically outperform baseline methods when makingpredictions within specified semantic levels, and that the probabilitydistribution provided by the CRF model can be leveraged to yield furtherperformance improvements when making unconstrained predictions over thehierarchy.

Learning Tree-Structured Detection Cascades for Heterogeneous Networks  of Embedded Devices

  In this paper, we present a new approach to learning cascaded classifiers foruse in computing environments that involve networks of heterogeneous andresource-constrained, low-power embedded compute and sensing nodes. We presenta generalization of the classical linear detection cascade to the case oftree-structured cascades where different branches of the tree execute ondifferent physical compute nodes in the network. Different nodes have access todifferent features, as well as access to potentially different computation andenergy resources. We concentrate on the problem of jointly learning theparameters for all of the classifiers in the cascade given a fixed cascadearchitecture and a known set of costs required to carry out the computation ateach node.To accomplish the objective of joint learning of all detectors, wepropose a novel approach to combining classifier outputs during training thatbetter matches the hard cascade setting in which the learned system will bedeployed. This work is motivated by research in the area of mobile health whereenergy efficient real time detectors integrating information from multiplewireless on-body sensors and a smart phone are needed for real-time monitoringand delivering just- in-time adaptive interventions. We apply our framework totwo activity recognition datasets as well as the problem of cigarette smokingdetection from a combination of wrist-worn actigraphy data and respirationchest band data.
