The Size Distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects

  We describe analytical and numerical collisional evolution calculations forthe size distribution of icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt. For a wide range ofbulk properties, initial masses, and orbital parameters, our results yieldpower-law cumulative size distributions, N_C propto r^{-q}, with q_L = 3.5 forlarge bodies with radii of 10-100 km, and q_s = 2.5-3 for small bodies withradii lesss than 0.1-1 km. The transition between the two power laws occurs ata break radius of 1-30 km. The break radius is more sensitive to the initialmass in the Kuiper Belt and the amount of stirring by Neptune than the bulkproperties of individual Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). Comparisons withobservations indicate that most models can explain the observed sky surfacedensity of KBOs for red magnitudes, R = 22-27. For R < 22 and R > 28, the modelsurface density is sensitive to the amount of stirring by Neptune, suggestingthat the size distribution of icy planets in the outer solar system providesindependent constraints on the formation of Neptune.

Complete projective connections

  The first examples of complete projective connections are uncovered: normalprojective connections on surfaces whose geodesics are all closed and embeddedare complete, as are normal projective connections induced from complete affineconnections with slowly decaying positive Ricci curvature.

An existing, ecologically-successful genus of collectively intelligent  artificial creatures

  People sometimes worry about the Singularity [Vinge, 1993; Kurzweil, 2005],or about the world being taken over by artificially intelligent robots. Ibelieve the risks of these are very small. However, few people recognize thatwe already share our world with artificial creatures that participate asintelligent agents in our society: corporations. Our planet is inhabited by twodistinct kinds of intelligent beings --- individual humans and corporateentities --- whose natures and interests are intimately linked. To co-existwell, we need to find ways to define the rights and responsibilities of bothindividual humans and corporate entities, and to find ways to ensure thatcorporate entities behave as responsible members of society.

Stellar encounters as the origin of distant solar system objects in  highly eccentric orbits

  The discovery of Sedna places new constraints on the origin and evolution ofour solar system. Here we investigate the possibility that a close encounterwith another star produced the observed edge of the Kuiper belt, at roughly 50AU, and the highly elliptical orbit of Sedna. We show that a passing starprobably scattered Sedna from the Kuiper Belt into its observed orbit. Thelikelihood that a planet at 60-80 AU can be scattered into Sedna's orbit isroughly 50%; this estimate depends critically on the geometry of the flyby.Even more interesting, though, is the roughly 10% chance that Sedna wascaptured from the outer disk of the passing star. Most captures have very highinclination orbits; detection of these objects would confirm the presence ofextrasolar planets in our own Solar System.

Formation and Collisional Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects

  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for theformation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the mainpredictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamicalperturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify theevolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory requirebetter KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadlyconsistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantialcollisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are importantproblems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroidssuggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identificationof more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provideadditional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding anddynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivatecalculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation andevolution.

Levy Flights of Binary Orbits due to Impulsive Encounters

  We examine the evolution of an almost circular Keplerian orbit interactingwith unbound perturbers. We calculate the change in eccentricity and angularmomentum that results from a single encounter, assuming the timescale for theinteraction is shorter than the orbital period. The orbital perturbations areincorporated into a Boltzmann equation that allows for eccentricitydissipation. We present an analytic solution to the Boltzmann equation thatdescribes the distribution of orbital eccentricity and relative inclination asa function of time. The eccentricity and inclination of the binary do notevolve according to a normal random walk but perform a Levy flight. The slopeof the mass spectrum of perturbers dictates whether close gravitationalscatterings are more important than distant tidal ones. When close scatteringsare important, the mass spectrum sets the slope of the eccentricity andinclination distribution functions. We use this general framework to understandthe eccentricities of several Kuiper belt systems: Pluto, 2003 EL 61, and Eris.We use the model of Tholen et al (2007) to separate the non-Kepleriancomponents of the orbits of Pluto's outer moons Nix and Hydra from the motionexcited by interactions with other Kuiper belt objects. Our distribution isconsistent with the observations of Nix, Hydra, and the satellites of 2003 EL61 and Eris. We address applications of this work to objects outside of thesolar system, such as extrasolar planets around their stars and millisecondpulsars.

Development of the Arizona Robotic Telescope Network

  The Arizona Robotic Telescope Network (ARTN) project is a long term effort todevelop a system of telescopes to carry out a flexible program of PI observing,survey projects, and time domain astrophysics including monitoring, rapidresponse, and transient/target-of-opportunity followup. Steward Observatoryoperates and shares in several 1-3m class telescopes with quality sites andinstrumentation, largely operated in classical modes. Science programs suitedto these telescopes are limited by scheduling flexibility and people-power ofavailable observers. Our goal is to adapt these facilities for multipleco-existing queued programs, interrupt capability, remote/robotic operation,and delivery of reduced data. In the long term, planning for the LSST era, weenvision an automated system coordinating across multiple telescopes and sites,where alerts can trigger followup, classification, and triggering of furtherobservations if required, such as followup imaging that can triggerspectroscopy. We are updating telescope control systems and software toimplement this system in stages, beginning with the Kuiper 61'' and VaticanObservatory 1.8-m telescopes. The Kuiper 61'' and its Mont4K camera can now becontrolled and queue-scheduled by the RTS2 observatory control software, andoperated from a remote room at Steward. We discuss science and technicalrequirements for ARTN, and some of the challenges in adapting heterogenouslegacy facilities, scheduling, data pipelines, and maintaining capabilities fora diverse user base.

Modeling the Formation of the Family of the Dwarf Planet Haumea

  The dwarf planet (136108) Haumea has an intriguing combination of uniquephysical properties: near-breakup spin, two regular satellites, and anunexpectedly compact family. While these properties indicate formation bycollision, there is no self-consistent and reasonably probable formationhypothesis that can connect the unusually rapid spin and the low relativevelocities of Haumea family members ("Haumeans"). We explore and test theproposed formation hypotheses (catastrophic collision, graze-and-merge, andsatellite collision). We flexibly parameterize the properties of the collision(e.g., the collision location) and use simple models for the three-dimensionalvelocity ejection field expected from each model to generate simulatedfamilies. These are compared to observed Kuiper Belt Objects using Bayesianparameter inference, including a mixture model that allows for interlopers fromthe background population. After testing our methodology, we find the bestmatch to the observed Haumeans is an isotropic ejection field with a typicalvelocity of 150 m s$^{-1}$. The graze-and-merge and satellite collisionhypotheses are disfavored. Including these constraints, we discuss theformation hypotheses in detail, including variations, some of which are tested.Some new hypotheses are proposed (a cratering collision and a collision whereHaumea's upper layers are "missing") and scrutinized. We do not identify asatisfactory formation hypothesis, but we do propose several avenues ofadditional investigation. In addition, we identify many new candidate Haumeansand dynamically confirm 7 of them as consistent with the observed family. Weconfirm that Haumeans have a shallow size distribution and discuss implicationsfor the identification of new Haumeans.

A 40 Myr Old Gaseous Circumstellar Disk at 49 Ceti: Massive CO-Rich  Comet Clouds at Young A-Type Stars

  The gaseous molecular disk that orbits the main sequence A-type star 49 Cetihas been known since 1995, but the stellar age and the origin of the observedcarbon monoxide molecules have been unknown. We now identify 49 Ceti as amember of the 40 Myr old Argus Association and present a colliding comet modelto explain the high CO concentrations seen at 49 Ceti and the 30 Myr old A-typestar HD 21997. The model suggests that massive -- 400 Earth mass -- analogs ofthe Sun's Kuiper Belt are in orbit about some A-type stars, that these largemasses are composed primarily of comet-like objects, and that these objects arerich in CO and perhaps also CO2. We identify additional early-type members ofthe Argus Association and the Tucana/Horologium and Columba Associations; someof these stars display excess mid-infrared emission as measured with theWidefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).

A Nonlinear Constrained Optimization Framework for Comfortable and  Customizable Motion Planning of Nonholonomic Mobile Robots - Part II

  In this series of papers, we present a motion planning framework for planningcomfortable and customizable motion of nonholonomic mobile robots such asintelligent wheelchairs and autonomous cars. In Part I, we presented themathematical foundation of our framework, where we model motion discomfort as aweighted cost functional and define comfortable motion planning as a nonlinearconstrained optimization problem of computing trajectories that minimize thisdiscomfort given the appropriate boundary conditions and constraints.  In this paper, we discretize the infinite-dimensional optimization problemusing conforming finite elements. We describe shape functions to handledifferent kinds of boundary conditions and the choice of unknowns to obtain asparse Hessian matrix. We also describe in detail how any trajectorycomputation problem can have infinitely many locally optimal solutions and ourmethod of handling them. Additionally, since we have a nonlinear andconstrained problem, computation of high quality initial guesses is crucial forefficient solution. We show how to compute them.

Scalability and Resilience of Software-Defined Networking: An Overview

  Software-Defined Networking (SDN) allows to control the available networkresources by an intelligent and centralized authority in order to optimizetraffic flows in a flexible manner. However, centralized control may facescalability issues when the network size or the number of traffic flowsincreases. Also, a centralized controller may form a single point of failure,thereby affecting the network resilience.  This article provides an overview of SDN that focuses on (1) scalabilityconcerning the increased control overhead faced by a central controller, and(2) resiliency in terms of protection against controller failure, networktopology failure and security in terms of malicious attacks.

Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence Courses

  The recent surge in interest in ethics in artificial intelligence may leavemany educators wondering how to address moral, ethical, and philosophicalissues in their AI courses. As instructors we want to develop curriculum thatnot only prepares students to be artificial intelligence practitioners, butalso to understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts thatartificial intelligence will have on society. In this article we providepractical case studies and links to resources for use by AI educators. We alsoprovide concrete suggestions on how to integrate AI ethics into a generalartificial intelligence course and how to teach a stand-alone artificialintelligence ethics course.

OSS (Outer Solar System): A fundamental and planetary physics mission to  Neptune, Triton and the Kuiper Belt

  The present OSS mission continues a long and bright tradition by associatingthe communities of fundamental physics and planetary sciences in a singlemission with ambitious goals in both domains. OSS is an M-class mission toexplore the Neptune system almost half a century after flyby of the Voyager 2spacecraft. Several discoveries were made by Voyager 2, including the GreatDark Spot (which has now disappeared) and Triton's geysers. Voyager 2 revealedthe dynamics of Neptune's atmosphere and found four rings and evidence of ringarcs above Neptune. Benefiting from a greatly improved instrumentation, it willresult in a striking advance in the study of the farthest planet of the SolarSystem. Furthermore, OSS will provide a unique opportunity to visit a selectedKuiper Belt object subsequent to the passage of the Neptunian system. It willconsolidate the hypothesis of the origin of Triton as a KBO captured byNeptune, and improve our knowledge on the formation of the Solar system. Theprobe will embark instruments allowing precise tracking of the probe duringcruise. It allows to perform the best controlled experiment for testing, indeep space, the General Relativity, on which is based all the models of Solarsystem formation. OSS is proposed as an international cooperation between ESAand NASA, giving the capability for ESA to launch an M-class mission towardsthe farthest planet of the Solar system, and to a Kuiper Belt object. Theproposed mission profile would allow to deliver a 500 kg class spacecraft. Thedesign of the probe is mainly constrained by the deep space gravity test inorder to minimise the perturbation of the accelerometer measurement.

A Nonlinear Constrained Optimization Framework for Comfortable and  Customizable Motion Planning of Nonholonomic Mobile Robots - Part I

  In this series of papers, we present a motion planning framework for planningcomfortable and customizable motion of nonholonomic mobile robots such asintelligent wheelchairs and autonomous cars. In this first one we present themathematical foundation of our framework.  The motion of a mobile robot that transports a human should be comfortableand customizable. We identify several properties that a trajectory must havefor comfort. We model motion discomfort as a weighted cost functional anddefine comfortable motion planning as a nonlinear constrained optimizationproblem of computing trajectories that minimize this discomfort given theappropriate boundary conditions and constraints. The optimization problem isinfinite-dimensional and we discretize it using conforming finite elements. Wealso outline a method by which different users may customize the motion toachieve personal comfort.  There exists significant past work in kinodynamic motion planning, to thebest of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive formulation ofkinodynamic motion planning for a nonholonomic mobile robot as a nonlinearoptimization problem that includes all of the following - a careful analysis ofboundary conditions, continuity requirements on trajectory, dynamicconstraints, obstacle avoidance constraints, and a robust numericalimplementation.  In this paper, we present the mathematical foundation of the motion planningframework and formulate the full nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Wedescribe, in brief, the discretization method using finite elements and theprocess of computing initial guesses for the optimization problem. Details ofthe above two are presented in Part II of the series.

Object Manipulation Learning by Imitation

  We aim to enable robot to learn object manipulation by imitation. Givenexternal observations of demonstrations on object manipulations, we believethat two underlying problems to address in learning by imitation is 1) segmenta given demonstration into skills that can be individually learned and reused,and 2) formulate the correct RL (Reinforcement Learning) problem that onlyconsiders the relevant aspects of each skill so that the policy for each skillcan be effectively learned. Previous works made certain progress in thisdirection, but none has taken private information into account. The publicinformation is the information that is available in the external observationsof demonstration, and the private information is the information that are onlyavailable to the agent that executes the actions, such as tactile sensations.Our contribution is that we provide a method for the robot to automaticallysegment the demonstration of object manipulations into multiple skills, andformulate the correct RL problem for each skill, and automatically decidewhether the private information is an important aspect of each skill based oninteraction with the world. Our experiment shows that our robot learns to pickup a block, and stack it onto another block by imitating an observeddemonstration. The evaluation is based on 1) whether the demonstration isreasonably segmented, 2) whether the correct RL problems are formulated, 3) andwhether a good policy is learned.

Back to "Normal" for the Disintegrating Planet Candidate KIC 12557548 b

  KIC 12557548 b is first of a growing class of intriguing disintegratingplanet candidates, which lose mass in the form of a metal rich vapor thatcondenses into dust particles. Here, we follow up two perplexing observationsof the system: 1) the transits appeared shallower than average in 2013 and 2014and 2) the parameters derived from a high resolution spectrum of the stardiffered from other results using photometry and low resolution spectroscopy.We observe 5 transits of the system with the 61-inch Kuiper telescope in 2016and show that they are consistent with photometry from the Kepler spacecraft in2009-2013, suggesting that the dusty tail has returned to normal length andmass. We also evaluate high resolution archival spectra from the Subaru HDSspectrograph and find them to be consistent with a main-sequence Teff=4440 +/-70 K star in agreement with the photometry and low resolution spectroscopy.This disfavors the hypothesis that planet disintegration affected the analysisof prior high resolution spectra of this star. We apply Principal ComponentAnalysis to the Kepler long cadence data to understand the modes ofdisintegration. There is a tentative 491 day periodicity of the secondprincipal component, which corresponds to possible long-term evolution of thedust grain sizes, though the mechanism on such long timescales remains unclear.

Identification of Main Sequence Stars with Mid-Infrared Excesses Using  GLIMPSE: Beta-Pictoris Analogs?

  Spitzer IRAC 3.6-8 micron photometry obtained as part of the GLIMPSE surveyhas revealed mid-infrared excesses for 33 field stars with known spectral typesin a 1.2 sq. degree field centered on the southern Galactic HII region RCW49.These stars comprise a subset of 184 stars with known spectral classification,most of which were pre-selected to have unusually red IR colors. We proposethat the mid-IR excesses are caused by circumstellar dust disks that are eithervery late remnants of stellar formation or debris disks generated by planetformation. Of these 33 stars, 29 appear to be main-sequence stars based onoptical spectral classifications. Five of the 29 main-sequence stars are O or Bstars with excesses that can be plausibly explained by thermal bremsstrahlungemission, and four are post main-sequence stars. The lone O star is an O4V((f))at a spectrophotometric distance of 3233+ 540- 535 pc and may be the earliestmember of the Westerlund 2 cluster. Of the remaining 24 main-sequence stars, 18have SEDs that are consistent with hot dusty debris disks, a possible signatureof planet formation. Modeling the excesses as blackbodies demonstrates that theblackbody components have fractional bolometric disk-to-star luminosity ratios,LIR/L*, ranging from 10^-3 to 10^-2 with temperatures ranging from 220 to 820K. The inferred temperatures are more consistent with asteroid belts ratherthan the cooler temperatures expected for Kuiper belts. Mid-IR excesses arefound in all spectral types from late B to early K.

Disk Radii and Grain Sizes in Herschel-Resolved Debris Disks

  (Abridged) The radii of debris disks and the sizes of their dust grains aretracers of the formation mechanisms and physical processes operating in thesesystems. We use a sample of 34 debris disks spatially resolved in variousHerschel programs to constrain them. While we modeled disks with both warm andcold components, we focus our analysis only on the cold outer disks, i.e.Kuiper-belt analogs. The disk radii derived from the resolved images reveal alarge dispersion, but no significant trend with the stellar luminosity, whichargues against ice lines as a dominant player in setting the debris disk sizes.Fixing the disk radii to those inferred from the resolved images, we model thespectral energy distributions to determine the dust temperatures and the grainsize distributions. While the dust temperature systematically increases towardsearlier spectral types, its ratio to the blackbody temperature at the diskradius decreases with the stellar luminosity. This is explained by an increaseof typical grain sizes towards more luminous stars. The sizes are compared tothe radiation pressure blowout limit $s_\text{blow}$ that is proportional tothe stellar luminosity-to-mass ratio and thus also increases towards earlierspectral classes. The grain sizes in the disks of G- to A-stars are inferred tobe several times $s_\text{blow}$ at all stellar luminosities, in agreement withcollisional models of debris disks. The sizes, measured in the units of$s_\text{blow}$, appear to decrease with the luminosity, which may besuggestive of the disk's stirring level increasing towards earlier-type stars.

Incidence of debris discs around FGK stars in the solar neighbourhood

  Debris discs are a consequence of the planet formation process and constitutethe fingerprints of planetesimal systems. Their solar system's counterparts arethe asteroid and Edgeworth-Kuiper belts. The aim of this paper is to providerobust numbers for the incidence of debris discs around FGK stars in the solarneighbourhood. The full sample of 177 FGK stars with d<20 pc proposed for theDUNES survey is presented. Herschel/PACS observations at 100 and 160 microncomplemented with data at 70 micron, and at 250, 350 and 500 micron SPIREphotometry, were obtained. The 123 objects observed by the DUNES collaborationwere presented in a previous paper. The remaining 54 stars, shared with theDEBRIS consortium and observed by them, and the combined full sample arestudied in this paper. The incidence of debris discs per spectral type isanalysed and put into context together with other parameters of the sample,like metallicity, rotation and activity, and age.  The subsample of 105 stars with d<15 pc containing 23 F, 33 G and 49 K stars,is complete for F stars, almost complete for G stars and contains a substantialnumber of K stars to draw solid conclusions on objects of this spectral type.The incidence rates of debris discs per spectral type 0.26 (6 objects withexcesses out of 23 F stars), 0.21 (7 out of 33 G stars) and 0.20 (10 out of 49K stars), the fraction for all three spectral types together being 0.22 (23 outof 105 stars). Uncertainties corresponding to a 95% confidence level are givenin the text for all these numbers. The medians of the upper limits ofL_dust/L_* for each spectral type are 7.8E-7 (F), 1.4E-6 (G) and 2.2E-6 (K);the lowest values being around 4.0E-7. The incidence of debris discs is similarfor active (young) and inactive (old) stars. The fractional luminosity tends todrop with increasing age, as expected from collisional erosion of the debrisbelts.

Secular Dynamics of an Exterior Test Particle: The Inverse Kozai and  Other Eccentricity-Inclination Resonances

  The behavior of an interior test particle in the secular 3-body problem hasbeen studied extensively. A well-known feature is the Lidov-Kozai resonance inwhich the test particle's argument of periapse librates about $\pm 90^\circ$and large oscillations in eccentricity and inclination are possible. Lessexplored is the inverse problem: the dynamics of an exterior test particle andan interior perturber. We survey numerically the inverse secular problem,expanding the potential to hexadecapolar order and correcting an error in thepublished expansion. Four secular resonances are uncovered that persist in full$N$-body treatments (in what follows, $\varpi$ and $\Omega$ are the longitudesof periapse and of ascending node, $\omega$ is the argument of periapse, andsubscripts 1 and 2 refer to the inner perturber and outer test particle): (i)an orbit-flipping quadrupole resonance requiring a non-zero perturbereccentricity $e_1$, in which $\Omega_2-\varpi_1$ librates about $\pm 90^\circ$;(ii) a hexadecapolar resonance (the "inverse Kozai" resonance) for perturbersthat are circular or nearly so and inclined by $I \simeq 63^\circ/117^\circ$,in which $\omega_2$ librates about $\pm 90^\circ$ and which can vary theparticle eccentricity by $\Delta e_2 \simeq 0.2$ and lead to orbit crossing;(iii) an octopole "apse-aligned" resonance at $I \simeq 46^\circ/107^\circ$wherein $\varpi_2 - \varpi_1$ librates about $0^\circ$ and $\Delta e_2$ growswith $e_1$; and (iv) an octopole resonance at $I \simeq 73^\circ/134^\circ$wherein $\varpi_2 + \varpi_1 - 2 \Omega_2$ librates about $0^\circ$ and $\Deltae_2$ can be as large as 0.3 for small $e_1 \neq 0$. The more eccentric theperturber, the more the particle's eccentricity and inclination vary; also,more polar orbits are more chaotic. Our inverse solutions may be applied to theKuiper belt and debris disks, circumbinary planets, and stellar systems.

Learning and Acting in Peripersonal Space: Moving, Reaching, and  Grasping

  The young infant explores its body, its sensorimotor system, and theimmediately accessible parts of its environment, over the course of a fewmonths creating a model of peripersonal space useful for reaching and graspingobjects around it. Drawing on constraints from the empirical literature oninfant behavior, we present a preliminary computational model of this learningprocess, implemented and evaluated on a physical robot. The learning agentexplores the relationship between the configuration space of the arm, sensingjoint angles through proprioception, and its visual perceptions of the hand andgrippers. The resulting knowledge is represented as the peripersonal space(PPS) graph, where nodes represent states of the arm, edges represent safemovements, and paths represent safe trajectories from one pose to another. Inour model, the learning process is driven by intrinsic motivation. Whenrepeatedly performing an action, the agent learns the typical result, but alsodetects unusual outcomes, and is motivated to learn how to make those unusualresults reliable. Arm motions typically leave the static background unchanged,but occasionally bump an object, changing its static position. The reach actionis learned as a reliable way to bump and move an object in the environment.Similarly, once a reliable reach action is learned, it typically makes aquasi-static change in the environment, moving an object from one staticposition to another. The unusual outcome is that the object is accidentallygrasped (thanks to the innate Palmar reflex), and thereafter moves dynamicallywith the hand. Learning to make grasps reliable is more complex than forreaches, but we demonstrate significant progress. Our current results are stepstoward autonomous sensorimotor learning of motion, reaching, and grasping inperipersonal space, based on unguided exploration and intrinsic motivation.

ATLAS Probe: Breakthrough Science of Galaxy Evolution, Cosmology, Milky  Way, and the Solar System

  ATLAS (Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy) Probe is a conceptfor a NASA probe-class space mission. It is the follow-up space mission toWFIRST, boosting its scientific return by obtaining deep IR slit spectroscopyfor 70% of all galaxies imaged by a 2000 sq deg WFIRST High Latitude Survey atz>0.5. ATLAS will measure accurate and precise redshifts for 200M galaxies outto z < 7, and deliver spectra that enable a wide range of diagnostic studies ofthe physical properties of galaxies over most of cosmic history. ATLAS Probescience spans four broad categories: (1) Revolutionizing galaxy evolutionstudies by tracing the relation between galaxies and dark matter from galaxygroups to cosmic voids and filaments, from the epoch of reionization throughthe peak era of galaxy assembly; (2) Opening a new window into the darkUniverse by weighing the dark matter filaments using 3D weak lensing withspectroscopic redshifts, and obtaining definitive measurements of dark energyand modification of General Relativity using galaxy clustering; (3) Probing theMilky Way's dust-enshrouded regions, reaching the far side of our Galaxy; and(4) Exploring the formation history of the outer Solar System by characterizingKuiper Belt Objects. ATLAS Probe is a 1.5m telescope with a field of view of0.4 sq deg, and uses Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) as slit selectors. Ithas a spectroscopic resolution of R = 1000 over 1-4 microns, and aspectroscopic multiplex factor >5,000. ATLAS is designed to fit within the NASAprobe-class space mission cost envelope; it has a single instrument, atelescope aperture that allows for a lighter launch vehicle, and maturetechnology. ATLAS Probe will lead to transformative science over the entirerange of astrophysics: from galaxy evolution to the dark Universe, from SolarSystem objects to the dusty regions of the Milky Way.
