A New Model of Plan Recognition

  We present a new abductive, probabilistic theory of plan recognition. Thismodel differs from previous plan recognition theories in being centered arounda model of plan execution: most previous methods have been based on plans asformal objects or on rules describing the recognition process. We show that ournew model accounts for phenomena omitted from most previous plan recognitiontheories: notably the cumulative effect of a sequence of observations ofpartially-ordered, interleaved plans and the effect of context on planadoption. The model also supports inferences about the evolution of planexecution in situations where another agent intervenes in plan execution. Thisfacility provides support for using plan recognition to build systems that willintelligently assist a user.

Structured Reachability Analysis for Markov Decision Processes

  Recent research in decision theoretic planning has focussed on making thesolution of Markov decision processes (MDPs) more feasible. We develop a familyof algorithms for structured reachability analysis of MDPs that are suitablewhen an initial state (or set of states) is known. Using compact, structuredrepresentations of MDPs (e.g., Bayesian networks), our methods, which vary inthe tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, produce structured descriptionsof (estimated) reachable states that can be used to eliminate variables orvariable values from the problem description, reducing the size of the MDP andmaking it easier to solve. One contribution of our work is the extension ofideas from GRAPHPLAN to deal with the distributed nature of actionrepresentations typically embodied within Bayes nets and the problem ofcorrelated action effects. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be mademore complete by using k-ary constraints instead of binary constraints. Anothercontribution is the illustration of how the compact representation ofreachability constraints can be exploited by several existing (exact andapproximate) abstraction algorithms for MDPs.
