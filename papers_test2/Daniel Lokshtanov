Parameterized Integer Quadratic Programming: Variables and Coefficients

  In the Integer Quadratic Programming problem input is an n*n integer matrixQ, an m*n integer matrix A and an m-dimensional integer vector b. The task isto find a vector x in Z^n, minimizing x^TQx, subject to Ax <= b. We give afixed parameter tractable algorithm for Integer Quadratic Programmingparameterized by n+a. Here a is the largest absolute value of an entry of Q andA. As an application of our main result we show that Optimal Linear Arrangementis fixed parameter tractable parameterized by the size of the smallest vertexcover of the input graph. This resolves an open problem from the recentmonograph by Downey and Fellows.

Feedback Vertex Set in Mixed Graphs

  A mixed graph is a graph with both directed and undirected edges. We presentan algorithm for deciding whether a given mixed graph on $n$ vertices containsa feedback vertex set (FVS) of size at most $k$, in time $2^{O(k)}k! O(n^4)$.This is the first fixed parameter tractable algorithm for FVS that applies toboth directed and undirected graphs.

The Structure of $W_4$-Immersion-Free Graphs

  We study the structure of graphs that do not contain the wheel on 5 verticesW4 as an immersion, and show that these graphs can be constructed via 1, 2, and3-edge-sums from subcubic graphs and graphs of bounded treewidth.

The complexity of independent set reconfiguration on bipartite graphs

  We settle the complexity of the Independent Set Reconfiguration problem onbipartite graphs under all three commonly studied reconfiguration models. Weshow that under the token jumping or token addition/removal model the problemis NP-complete. For the token sliding model, we show that the problem remainsPSPACE-complete.

Known Algorithms on Graphs of Bounded Treewidth are Probably Optimal

  We obtain a number of lower bounds on the running time of algorithms solvingproblems on graphs of bounded treewidth. We prove the results under the StrongExponential Time Hypothesis of Impagliazzo and Paturi. In particular, assumingthat SAT cannot be solved in (2-\epsilon)^{n}m^{O(1)} time, we show that forany e > 0; {\sc Independent Set} cannot be solved in (2-e)^{tw(G)}|V(G)|^{O(1)}time, {\sc Dominating Set} cannot be solved in (3-e)^{tw(G)}|V(G)|^{O(1)} time,{\sc Max Cut} cannot be solved in (2-e)^{tw(G)}|V(G)|^{O(1)} time, {\sc OddCycle Transversal} cannot be solved in (3-e)^{tw(G)}|V(G)|^{O(1)} time, For any$q \geq 3$, $q$-{\sc Coloring} cannot be solved in (q-e)^{tw(G)}|V(G)|^{O(1)}time, {\sc Partition Into Triangles} cannot be solved in(2-e)^{tw(G)}|V(G)|^{O(1)} time. Our lower bounds match the running times forthe best known algorithms for the problems, up to the e in the base.

An improved isomorphism test for bounded-tree-width graphs

  We give a new fpt algorithm testing isomorphism of $n$-vertex graphs of treewidth $k$ in time $2^{k\operatorname{polylog} (k)}\operatorname{poly} (n)$,improving the fpt algorithm due to Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, andSaurabh (FOCS 2014), which runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^5\logk)}\operatorname{poly} (n)$. Based on an improved version of theisomorphism-invariant graph decomposition technique introduced by Lokshtanov etal., we prove restrictions on the structure of the automorphism groups ofgraphs of tree width $k$. Our algorithm then makes heavy use of the grouptheoretic techniques introduced by Luks (JCSS 1982) in his isomorphism test forbounded degree graphs and Babai (STOC 2016) in his quasipolynomial isomorphismtest. In fact, we even use Babai's algorithm as a black box in one place.  We also give a second algorithm which, at the price of a slightly worserunning time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2 \log k)}\operatorname{poly} (n)$, avoids theuse of Babai's algorithm and, more importantly, has the additional benefit thatit can also used as a canonization algorithm.

A O(c^k n) 5-Approximation Algorithm for Treewidth

  We give an algorithm that for an input n-vertex graph G and integer k>0, intime 2^[O(k)]n either outputs that the treewidth of G is larger than k, orgives a tree decomposition of G of width at most 5k+4. This is the firstalgorithm providing a constant factor approximation for treewidth which runs intime single-exponential in k and linear in n. Treewidth based computations aresubroutines of numerous algorithms. Our algorithm can be used to speed up manysuch algorithms to work in time which is single-exponential in the treewidthand linear in the input size.

Efficient Computation of Representative Sets with Applications in  Parameterized and Exact Algorithms

  We give two algorithms computing representative families of linear anduniform matroids and demonstrate how to use representative families fordesigning single-exponential parameterized and exact exponential timealgorithms. The applications of our approach include  - LONGEST DIRECTED CYCLE  - MINIMUM EQUIVALENT GRAPH (MEG)  - Algorithms on graphs of bounded treewidth  -k-PATH, k-TREE, and more generally, k-SUBGRAPH ISOMORPHISM, where thek-vertex pattern graph is of constant treewidth.

A $2\ell k$ Kernel for $\ell$-Component Order Connectivity

  In the $\ell$-Component Order Connectivity problem ($\ell \in \mathbb{N}$),we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and a non-negative integer$k$ and asks whether there exists a set of vertices $S\subseteq V(G)$ such that$|S|\leq k$ and the size of the largest connected component in $G-S$ is at most$\ell$. In this paper, we give a kernel for $\ell$-Component Order Connectivitywith at most $2\ell k$ vertices that takes $n^{\mathcal{O}(\ell)}$ time forevery constant $\ell$. On the way to obtaining our kernel, we prove ageneralization of the $q$-Expansion Lemma to weighted graphs. Thisgeneralization may be of independent interest.

Planar F-Deletion: Approximation and Optimal FPT Algorithms

  Let F be a finite set of graphs. In the F-Deletion problem, we are given ann-vertex, m-edge graph G and an integer k as input, and asked whether at most kvertices can be deleted from G such that the resulting graph does not contain agraph from F as a minor. F-Deletion is a generic problem and by selectingdifferent sets of forbidden minors F, one can obtain various fundamentalproblems such as Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set or Treewidth t-Deletion.  In this paper we obtain a number of generic algorithmic results about PlanarF-Deletion, when F contains at least one planar graph. The highlights of ourwork are  - A randomized O(nm) time constant factor approximation algorithm for theoptimization version of Planar F-Deletion.  - A randomized O(2^{O(k)} n) time parameterized algorithm for PlanarF-Deletion when F is connected. Here a family F is called connected if everygraph in F is connected. The algorithm can be made deterministic at the cost ofmaking the polynomial factor in the running time n\log^2 n rather than linear.  These algorithms unify, generalize, and improve over a multitude of resultsin the literature. Our main results have several direct applications, but alsothe methods we develop on the way have applicability beyond the scope of thispaper. Our results -- constant factor approximation and FPT algorithms -- arestringed together by a common theme of polynomial time preprocessing.

Faster Exact and Parameterized Algorithm for Feedback Vertex Set in  Tournaments

  A tournament is a directed graph T such that every pair of vertices areconnected by an arc. A feedback vertex set is a set S of vertices in T suchthat T - S is acyclic. In this article we consider the Feedback Vertex Setproblem in tournaments. Here input is a tournament T and integer k, and thetask is to determine whether T has a feedback vertex set of size at most k. Wegive a new algorithm for Feedback Vertex Set in Tournaments. The running timeof our algorithm is upper bounded by O(1.618^k + n^{O(1)}) and by O(1.46^n).Thus our algorithm simultaneously improves over the fastest known parameterizedalgorithm for the problem by Dom et al. running in time O(2^kk^{O(1)} +n^{O(1)}), and the fastest known exact exponential time algorithm by Gaspersand Mnich with running time O(1.674^n).  On the way to prove our main result we prove a new partitioning theorem forundirected graphs. In particular we show that the vertices of any undirectedm-edge graph of maximum degree d can be colored white or black in such a waythat for each of the two colors, the number of edges with both endpoints ofthat color is between m/4-d/2 and m/4+d/4.

Clustering with Local Restrictions

  We study a family of graph clustering problems where each cluster has tosatisfy a certain local requirement. Formally, let $\mu$ be a function on thesubsets of vertices of a graph $G$. In the $(\mu,p,q)$-PARTITION problem, thetask is to find a partition of the vertices into clusters where each cluster$C$ satisfies the requirements that (1) at most $q$ edges leave $C$ and (2)$\mu(C)\le p$. Our first result shows that if $\mu$ is an {\em arbitrary}polynomial-time computable monotone function, then $(\mu,p,q)$-PARTITION can besolved in time $n^{O(q)}$, i.e., it is polynomial-time solvable {\em for everyfixed $q$}. We study in detail three concrete functions $\mu$ (the number ofvertices in the cluster, number of nonedges in the cluster, maximum number ofnon-neighbors a vertex has in the cluster), which correspond to naturalclustering problems. For these functions, we show that $(\mu,p,q)$-PARTITIONcan be solved in time $2^{O(p)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ and in time $2^{O(q)}\cdotn^{O(1)}$ on $n$-vertex graphs, i.e., the problem is fixed-parameter tractableparameterized by $p$ or by $q$.

Slightly Superexponential Parameterized Problems

  A central problem in parameterized algorithms is to obtain algorithms  with running time $f(k)\cdot n^{O(1)}$ such that $f$ is as slow growingfunction of the parameter $k$ as possible. In particular, a large number ofbasic parameterized problems admit parameterized algorithms where $f(k)$ issingle-exponential, that is, $c^k$ for some constant $c$, which makes aimingfor such a running time a natural goal for other problems as well. Howeverthere are still plenty of problems where the $f(k)$ appearing in the best knownrunning time is worse than single-exponential and it remained ``slightlysuperexponential'' even after serious attempts to bring it down. A naturalquestion to ask is whether the $f(k)$ appearing in the running time of thebest-known algorithms is optimal for any of these problems.  In this paper, we examine parameterized problems where $f(k)$ is$k^{O(k)}=2^{O(k\log k)}$ in the best known running time and for a number ofsuch problems, we show that the dependence on $k$ in the running time cannot beimproved to single exponential. (See paper for the longer abstract.)

Bidimensionality and EPTAS

  Bidimensionality theory is a powerful framework for the development ofmetaalgorithmic techniques. It was introduced by Demaine et al. as a tool toobtain sub-exponential time parameterized algorithms for problems on H-minorfree graphs. Demaine and Hajiaghayi extended the theory to obtain PTASs forbidimensional problems, and subsequently improved these results to EPTASs.Fomin et. al related the theory to the existence of linear kernels forparameterized problems. In this paper we revisit bidimensionality theory fromthe perspective of approximation algorithms and redesign the framework forobtaining EPTASs to be more powerful, easier to apply and easier to understand.  Two of the most widely used approaches to obtain PTASs on planar graphs arethe Lipton-Tarjan separator based approach, and Baker's approach. Demaine andHajiaghayi strengthened both approaches using bidimensionality and obtainedEPTASs for a multitude of problems. We unify the two strenghtened approaches tocombine the best of both worlds. At the heart of our framework is adecomposition lemma which states that for "most" bidimensional problems, thereis a polynomial time algorithm which given an H-minor-free graph G as input andan e > 0 outputs a vertex set X of size e * OPT such that the treewidth of G nX is f(e). Here, OPT is the objective function value of the problem in questionand f is a function depending only on e. This allows us to obtain EPTASs on(apex)-minor-free graphs for all problems covered by the previous framework, aswell as for a wide range of packing problems, partial covering problems andproblems that are neither closed under taking minors, nor contractions. To thebest of our knowledge for many of these problems including cycle packing,vertex-h-packing, maximum leaf spanning tree, and partial r-dominating set noEPTASs on planar graphs were previously known.

Faster Parameterized Algorithms using Linear Programming

  We investigate the parameterized complexity of Vertex Cover parameterized bythe difference between the size of the optimal solution and the value of thelinear programming (LP) relaxation of the problem. By carefully analyzing thechange in the LP value in the branching steps, we argue that combiningpreviously known preprocessing rules with the most straightforward branchingalgorithm yields an $O^*((2.618)^k)$ algorithm for the problem. Here $k$ is theexcess of the vertex cover size over the LP optimum, and we write $O^*(f(k))$for a time complexity of the form $O(f(k)n^{O(1)})$, where $f (k)$ growsexponentially with $k$. We proceed to show that a more sophisticated branchingalgorithm achieves a runtime of $O^*(2.3146^k)$.  Following this, using known and new reductions, we give $O^*(2.3146^k)$algorithms for the parameterized versions of Above Guarantee Vertex Cover, OddCycle Transversal, Split Vertex Deletion and Almost 2-SAT, and an$O^*(1.5214^k)$ algorithm for Ko\"nig Vertex Deletion, Vertex Cover Param byOCT and Vertex Cover Param by KVD. These algorithms significantly improve thebest known bounds for these problems. The most notable improvement is the newbound for Odd Cycle Transversal - this is the first algorithm which beats thedependence on $k$ of the seminal $O^*(3^k)$ algorithm of Reed, Smith and Vetta.Finally, using our algorithm, we obtain a kernel for the standardparameterization of Vertex Cover with at most $2k - c \log k$ vertices. Ourkernel is simpler than previously known kernels achieving the same size bound.

Subexponential-time Algorithms for Maximum Independent Set in $P_t$-free  and Broom-free Graphs

  In algorithmic graph theory, a classic open question is to determine thecomplexity of the Maximum Independent Set problem on $P_t$-free graphs, thatis, on graphs not containing any induced path on $t$ vertices. So far,polynomial-time algorithms are known only for $t\le 5$ [Lokshtanov et al., SODA2014, 570--581, 2014], and an algorithm for $t=6$ announced recently [Grzesiket al. Arxiv 1707.05491, 2017]. Here we study the existence ofsubexponential-time algorithms for the problem: we show that for any $t\ge 1$,there is an algorithm for Maximum Independent Set on $P_t$-free graphs whoserunning time is subexponential in the number of vertices. Even for the weightedversion MWIS, the problem is solvable in $2^{O(\sqrt {tn \log n})}$ time on$P_t$-free graphs. For approximation of MIS in broom-free graphs, a similartime bound is proved.  Scattered Set is the generalization of Maximum Independent Set where thevertices of the solution are required to be at distance at least $d$ from eachother. We give a complete characterization of those graphs $H$ for which$d$-Scattered Set on $H$-free graphs can be solved in time subexponential inthe size of the input (that is, in the number of vertices plus the number ofedges): If every component of $H$ is a path, then $d$-Scattered Set on $H$-freegraphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges can be solved in time$2^{O(|V(H)|\sqrt{n+m}\log (n+m))}$, even if $d$ is part of the input.Otherwise, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH), there is no$2^{o(n+m)}$-time algorithm for $d$-Scattered Set for any fixed $d\ge 3$ on$H$-free graphs with $n$-vertices and $m$-edges.

(Meta) Kernelization

  In a parameterized problem, every instance I comes with a positive integer k.The problem is said to admit a polynomial kernel if, in polynomial time, onecan reduce the size of the instance I to a polynomial in k, while preservingthe answer. In this work we give two meta-theorems on kernelzation. The firsttheorem says that all problems expressible in Counting Monadic Second OrderLogic and satisfying a coverability property admit a polynomial kernel ongraphs of bounded genus. Our second result is that all problems that havefinite integer index and satisfy a weaker coverability property admit a linearkernel on graphs of bounded genus. These theorems unify and extend allpreviously known kernelization results for planar graph problems.

Obtaining a Bipartite Graph by Contracting Few Edges

  We initiate the study of the Bipartite Contraction problem from theperspective of parameterized complexity. In this problem we are given a graph$G$ and an integer $k$, and the task is to determine whether we can obtain abipartite graph from $G$ by a sequence of at most $k$ edge contractions. Ourmain result is an $f(k) n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for Bipartite Contraction.Despite a strong resemblance between Bipartite Contraction and the classicalOdd Cycle Transversal (OCT) problem, the methods developed to tackle OCT do notseem to be directly applicable to Bipartite Contraction. Our algorithm is basedon a novel combination of the irrelevant vertex technique, introduced byRobertson and Seymour, and the concept of important separators. Both techniqueshave previously been used as key components of algorithms for fundamentalproblems in parameterized complexity. However, to the best of our knowledge,this is the first time the two techniques are applied in unison.

SeeSite: Efficiently Finding Co-occurring Splice Sites and Exon Splicing  Enhancers

  The problem of identifying splice sites consists of two sub-problems: findingtheir boundaries, and characterizing their sequence markers. Other splicingelements---including, enhancers and silencers---that occur in the intronic andexonic regions play an important role in splicing activity. Existing methodsfor detecting splicing elements are limited to finding either splice sites orenhancers and silencers, even though these elements are well-known to co-occur.We introduce SeeSite, an efficient and accurate tool for detecting splice sitesand their complementary exon splicing enhancers (ESEs).  SeeSite has three stages: graph construction, finding dense subgraphs, andrecovering splice sites and ESEs along with their consensus. The third stepinvolves solving Consensus Sequence with Outliers, an NP-complete stringclustering problem. We prove that our algorithm for this problem outputsnear-optimal solutions in polynomial time. Using SeeSite we demonstrate thatESEs are preferentially associated with weaker splice sites, and splice sitesof a certain canonical form co-occur with specific ESEs.

Tree Deletion Set has a Polynomial Kernel (but no OPT^O(1)  approximation)

  In the Tree Deletion Set problem the input is a graph G together with aninteger k. The objective is to determine whether there exists a set S of atmost k vertices such that G-S is a tree. The problem is NP-complete and evenNP-hard to approximate within any factor of OPT^c for any constant c. In thispaper we give a O(k^4) size kernel for the Tree Deletion Set problem. To thebest of our knowledge our result is the first counterexample to the"conventional wisdom" that kernelization algorithms automatically provideapproximation algorithms with approximation ratio close to the size of thekernel. An appealing feature of our kernelization algorithm is a new algebraicreduction rule that we use to handle the instances on which Tree Deletion Setis hard to approximate.

Minimum Bisection is fixed parameter tractable

  In the classic Minimum Bisection problem we are given as input a graph $G$and an integer $k$. The task is to determine whether there is a partition of$V(G)$ into two parts $A$ and $B$ such that $||A|-|B|| \leq 1$ and there are atmost $k$ edges with one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$. In this paper wegive an algorithm for Minimum Bisection with running time $O(2^{O(k^{3})}n^3\log^3 n)$. This is the first fixed parameter tractable algorithm for MinimumBisection. At the core of our algorithm lies a new decomposition theorem thatstates that every graph $G$ can be decomposed by small separators into partswhere each part is "highly connected" in the following sense: any cut ofbounded size can separate only a limited number of vertices from each part ofthe decomposition. Our techniques generalize to the weighted setting, where weseek for a bisection of minimum weight among solutions that contain at most $k$edges.

Fixed-parameter tractable canonization and isomorphism test for graphs  of bounded treewidth

  We give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that, given a parameter $k$ andtwo graphs $G_1,G_2$, either concludes that one of these graphs has treewidthat least $k$, or determines whether $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic. The runningtime of the algorithm on an $n$-vertex graph is $2^{O(k^5\log k)}\cdot n^5$,and this is the first fixed-parameter algorithm for Graph Isomorphismparameterized by treewidth.  Our algorithm in fact solves the more general canonization problem. We namelydesign a procedure working in $2^{O(k^5\log k)}\cdot n^5$ time that, for agiven graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, either concludes that the treewidth of $G$ isat least $k$, or: * finds in an isomorphic-invariant way a graph$\mathfrak{c}(G)$ that is isomorphic to $G$; * finds an isomorphism-invariantconstruction term --- an algebraic expression that encodes $G$ together with atree decomposition of $G$ of width $O(k^4)$.  Hence, the isomorphism test reduces to verifying whether the computedisomorphic copies or the construction terms for $G_1$ and $G_2$ are equal.

On the Threshold of Intractability

  We study the computational complexity of the graph modification problemsThreshold Editing and Chain Editing, adding and deleting as few edges aspossible to transform the input into a threshold (or chain) graph. In thisarticle, we show that both problems are NP-complete, resolving a conjecture byNatanzon, Shamir, and Sharan (Discrete Applied Mathematics, 113(1):109--128,2001). On the positive side, we show the problem admits a quadratic vertexkernel. Furthermore, we give a subexponential time parameterized algorithmsolving Threshold Editing in $2^{O(\surd k \log k)} + \text{poly}(n)$ time,making it one of relatively few natural problems in this complexity class ongeneral graphs. These results are of broader interest to the field of socialnetwork analysis, where recent work of Brandes (ISAAC, 2014) posits that theminimum edit distance to a threshold graph gives a good measure of consistencyfor node centralities. Finally, we show that all our positive results extend tothe related problem of Chain Editing, as well as the completion and deletionvariants of both problems.

Lower bounds for approximation schemes for Closest String

  In the Closest String problem one is given a family $\mathcal S$ ofequal-length strings over some fixed alphabet, and the task is to find a string$y$ that minimizes the maximum Hamming distance between $y$ and a string from$\mathcal S$. While polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTASes) for thisproblem are known for a long time [Li et al., J. ACM'02], no efficientpolynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS) has been proposed so far. In thispaper, we prove that the existence of an EPTAS for Closest String is in factunlikely, as it would imply that $\mathrm{FPT}=\mathrm{W}[1]$, a highlyunexpected collapse in the hierarchy of parameterized complexity classes. Ourproof also shows that the existence of a PTAS for Closest String with runningtime $f(\varepsilon)\cdot n^{o(1/\varepsilon)}$, for any computable function$f$, would contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

A Linear Time Parameterized Algorithm for Node Unique Label Cover

  The optimization version of the Unique Label Cover problem is at the heart ofthe Unique Games Conjecture which has played an important role in the proof ofseveral tight inapproximability results. In recent years, this problem has beenalso studied extensively from the point of view of parameterized complexity.Cygan et al. [FOCS 2012] proved that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable(FPT) and Wahlstr\"om [SODA 2014] gave an FPT algorithm with an improvedparameter dependence. Subsequently, Iwata, Wahlstr\"om and Yoshida [2014]proved that the edge version of Unique Label Cover can be solved in linearFPT-time. That is, there is an FPT algorithm whose dependence on the input-sizeis linear. However, such an algorithm for the node version of the problem wasleft as an open problem. In this paper, we resolve this question by presentingthe first linear-time FPT algorithm for Node Unique Label Cover.

Below all subsets for Minimal Connected Dominating Set

  A vertex subset $S$ in a graph $G$ is a dominating set if every vertex notcontained in $S$ has a neighbor in $S$. A dominating set $S$ is a connecteddominating set if the subgraph $G[S]$ induced by $S$ is connected. A connecteddominating set $S$ is a minimal connected dominating set if no proper subset of$S$ is also a connected dominating set. We prove that there exists a constant$\varepsilon > 10^{-50}$ such that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has at most$O(2^{(1-\varepsilon)n})$ minimal connected dominating sets. For the same$\varepsilon$ we also give an algorithm with running time$2^{(1-\varepsilon)n}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ to enumerate all minimal connecteddominating sets in an input graph $G$.

Parameterized Complexity and Approximability of Directed Odd Cycle  Transversal

  A directed odd cycle transversal of a directed graph (digraph) $D$ is avertex set $S$ that intersects every odd directed cycle of $D$. In the DirectedOdd Cycle Transversal (DOCT) problem, the input consists of a digraph $D$ andan integer $k$. The objective is to determine whether there exists a directedodd cycle transversal of $D$ of size at most $k$.  In this paper, we settle the parameterized complexity of DOCT whenparameterized by the solution size $k$ by showing that DOCT does not admit analgorithm with running time $f(k)n^{O(1)}$ unless FPT = W[1]. On the positiveside, we give a factor $2$ fixed parameter tractable (FPT) approximationalgorithm for the problem. More precisely, our algorithm takes as input $D$ and$k$, runs in time $2^{O(k^2)}n^{O(1)}$, and either concludes that $D$ does nothave a directed odd cycle transversal of size at most $k$, or produces asolution of size at most $2k$. Finally, we provide evidence that there exists$\epsilon > 0$ such that DOCT does not admit a factor $(1+\epsilon)$FPT-approximation algorithm.

Finding, Hitting and Packing Cycles in Subexponential Time on Unit Disk  Graphs

  We give algorithms with running time $2^{O({\sqrt{k}\log{k}})} \cdotn^{O(1)}$ for the following problems. Given an $n$-vertex unit disk graph $G$and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ contains (1) a path on exactly/at least$k$ vertices, (2) a cycle on exactly $k$ vertices, (3) a cycle on at least $k$vertices, (4) a feedback vertex set of size at most $k$, and (5) a set of $k$pairwise vertex-disjoint cycles. For the first three problems, nosubexponential time parameterized algorithms were previously known. For theremaining two problems, our algorithms significantly outperform the previouslybest known parameterized algorithms that run in time $2^{O(k^{0.75}\log{k})}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. Our algorithms are based on a new kind of tree decompositionsof unit disk graphs where the separators can have size up to $k^{O(1)}$ andthere exists a solution that crosses every separator at most $O(\sqrt{k})$times. The running times of our algorithms are optimal up to the $\log{k}$factor in the exponent, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

Feedback Vertex Set Inspired Kernel for Chordal Vertex Deletion

  Given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, the Chordal Vertex Deletion (CVD)problem asks whether there exists a subset $U\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most$k$ that hits all induced cycles of size at least 4. The existence of apolynomial kernel for CVD was a well-known open problem in the field ofParameterized Complexity. Recently, Jansen and Pilipczuk resolved this questionaffirmatively by designing a polynomial kernel for CVD of size$O(k^{161}\log^{58}k)$, and asked whether one can design a kernel of size$O(k^{10})$. While we do not completely resolve this question, we design asignificantly smaller kernel of size $O(k^{12}\log^{10}k)$, inspired by the$O(k^2)$-size kernel for Feedback Vertex Set. Furthermore, we introduce thenotion of the independence degree of a vertex, which is our main conceptualcontribution.

Covering vectors by spaces: Regular matroids

  Seymour's decomposition theorem for regular matroids is a fundamental resultwith a number of combinatorial and algorithmic applications. In this work wedemonstrate how this theorem can be used in the design of parameterizedalgorithms on regular matroids. We consider the problem of covering a set ofvectors of a given finite dimensional linear space (vector space) by a subspacegenerated by a set of vectors of minimum size. Specifically, in the Space Coverproblem, we are given a matrix M and a subset of its columns T; the task is tofind a minimum set F of columns of M disjoint with T such that that the linearspan of F contains all vectors of T. For graphic matroids this problem isessentially Stainer Forest and for cographic matroids this is a generalizationof Multiway Cut. Our main result is the algorithm with running time2^{O(k)}||M|| ^{O(1)} solving Space Cover in the case when M is a totallyunimodular matrix over rationals, where k is the size of F. In other words, weshow that on regular matroids the problem is fixed-parameter tractableparameterized by the rank of the covering subspace.

Balanced Judicious Partition is Fixed-Parameter Tractable

  The family of judicious partitioning problems, introduced by Bollob\'as andScott to the field of extremal combinatorics, has been extensively studied froma structural point of view for over two decades. This rich realm of problemsaims to counterbalance the objectives of classical partitioning problems suchas Min Cut, Min Bisection and Max Cut. While these classical problems focussolely on the minimization/maximization of the number of edges crossing thecut, judicious (bi)partitioning problems ask the natural question of theminimization/maximization of the number of edges lying in the (two) sides ofthe cut. In particular, Judicious Bipartition (JB) seeks a bipartition that is"judicious" in the sense that neither side is burdened by too many edges, andBalanced JB also requires that the sizes of the sides themselves are "balanced"in the sense that neither of them is too large. Both of these problems weredefined in the work by Bollob\'as and Scott, and have received notablescientific attention since then. In this paper, we shed light on the study ofjudicious partitioning problems from the viewpoint of algorithm design.Specifically, we prove that BJB is FPT (which also proves that JB is FPT).

Reducing CMSO Model Checking to Highly Connected Graphs

  Given a Counting Monadic Second Order (CMSO) sentence $\psi$, theCMSO$[\psi]$ problem is defined as follows. The input to CMSO$[\psi]$ is agraph $G$, and the objective is to determine whether $G\models \psi$. Our maintheorem states that for every CMSO sentence $\psi$, if CMSO$[\psi]$ is solvablein polynomial time on "globally highly connected graphs", then CMSO$[\psi]$ issolvable in polynomial time (on general graphs). We demonstrate the utility ofour theorem in the design of parameterized algorithms. Specifically we showthat technical problem-specific ingredients of a powerful method for designingparameterized algorithms, recursive understanding, can be replaced by ablack-box invocation of our main theorem. We also show that our theorem can beeasily deployed to show fixed parameterized tractability of a wide range ofproblems, where the input is a graph $G$ and the task is to find a connectedinduced subgraph of $G$ such that "few" vertices in this subgraph haveneighbors outside the subgraph, and additionally the subgraph has aCMSO-definable property.

A New Perspective on FO Model Checking of Dense Graph Classes

  We study the first-order (FO) model checking problem of dense graphs, namelythose which have FO interpretations in (or are FO transductions of) some sparsegraph classes. We give a structural characterization of the graph classes whichare FO interpretable in graphs of bounded degree. This characterization allowsus to efficiently compute such an FO interpretation for an input graph. As aconsequence, we obtain an FPT algorithm for successor-invariant FO modelchecking of any graph class which is FO interpretable in (or an FO transductionof) a graph class of bounded degree. The approach we use to obtain theseresults may also be of independent interest.

The Parameterized Complexity of Finding Point Sets with Hereditary  Properties

  We consider problems where the input is a set of points in the plane and aninteger $k$, and the task is to find a subset $S$ of the input points of size$k$ such that $S$ satisfies some property. We focus on properties that dependonly on the order type of the points and are monotone under point removals. Weshow that not all such problems are fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by$k$, by exhibiting a property defined by three forbidden patterns for whichfinding a $k$-point subset with the property is $\mathrm{W}[1]$-complete and(assuming the exponential time hypothesis) cannot be solved in time$n^{o(k/\log k)}$. However, we show that problems of this type arefixed-parameter tractable for all properties that include all collinear pointsets, properties that exclude at least one convex polygon, and propertiesdefined by a single forbidden pattern.

A 2-Approximation Algorithm for Feedback Vertex Set in Tournaments

  A {\em tournament} is a directed graph $T$ such that every pair of verticesis connected by an arc. A {\em feedback vertex set} is a set $S$ of vertices in$T$ such that $T - S$ is acyclic. We consider the {\sc Feedback Vertex Set}problem in tournaments. Here the input is a tournament $T$ and a weightfunction $w : V(T) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and the task is to find a feedbackvertex set $S$ in $T$ minimizing $w(S) = \sum_{v \in S} w(v)$. We give thefirst polynomial time factor $2$ approximation algorithm for this problem.Assuming the Unique Games conjecture, this is the best possible approximationratio achievable in polynomial time.

Kernel(s) for Problems With no Kernel: On Out-Trees With Many Leaves

  The {\sc $k$-Leaf Out-Branching} problem is to find an out-branching (i.e. arooted oriented spanning tree) with at least $k$ leaves in a given digraph. Theproblem has recently received much attention from the viewpoint ofparameterized algorithms {alonLNCS4596,AlonFGKS07fsttcs,BoDo2,KnLaRo}. In thispaper we step aside and take a kernelization based approach to the {\sc$k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} problem. We give the first polynomial kernel for {\scRooted $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching}, a variant of {\sc $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} wherethe root of the tree searched for is also a part of the input. Our kernel hascubic size and is obtained using extremal combinatorics.  For the {\sc $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} problem we show that no polynomialkernel is possible unless polynomial hierarchy collapses to third level%$PH=\Sigma_p^3$ by applying a recent breakthrough result by Bodlaender et al.{BDFH08} in a non-trivial fashion. However our positive results for {\sc Rooted$k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} immediately imply that the seemingly intractable the{\sc $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} problem admits a data reduction to $n$ independent$O(k^3)$ kernels. These two results, tractability and intractability side byside, are the first separating {\it many-to-one kernelization} from {\it Turingkernelization}. This answers affirmatively an open problem regarding "cheatkernelization" raised in {IWPECOPEN08}.

Subexponential parameterized algorithms for planar and apex-minor-free  graphs via low treewidth pattern covering

  We prove the following theorem. Given a planar graph $G$ and an integer $k$,it is possible in polynomial time to randomly sample a subset $A$ of verticesof $G$ with the following properties: (i) $A$ induces a subgraph of $G$ oftreewidth $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k}\log k)$, and (ii) for every connected subgraph$H$ of $G$ on at most $k$ vertices, the probability that $A$ covers the wholevertex set of $H$ is at least $(2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k}\log^2 k)}\cdotn^{\mathcal{O}(1)})^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$.  Together with standard dynamic programming techniques for graphs of boundedtreewidth, this result gives a versatile technique for obtaining (randomized)subexponential parameterized algorithms for problems on planar graphs, usuallywith running time bound $2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k} \log^2 k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The technique can be applied to problems expressible assearching for a small, connected pattern with a prescribed property in a largehost graph, examples of such problems include Directed $k$-Path, Weighted$k$-Path, Vertex Cover Local Search, and Subgraph Isomorphism, among others. Upto this point, it was open whether these problems can be solved insubexponential parameterized time on planar graphs, because they are notamenable to the classic technique of bidimensionality. Furthermore, all ourresults hold in fact on any class of graphs that exclude a fixed apex graph asa minor, in particular on graphs embeddable in any fixed surface.

Beyond Bidimensionality: Parameterized Subexponential Algorithms on  Directed Graphs

  We develop two different methods to achieve subexponential time parameterizedalgorithms for problems on sparse directed graphs. We exemplify our approacheswith two well studied problems.  For the first problem, {\sc $k$-Leaf Out-Branching}, which is to find anoriented spanning tree with at least $k$ leaves, we obtain an algorithm solvingthe problem in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)} n+ n^{O(1)}$ on directed graphswhose underlying undirected graph excludes some fixed graph $H$ as a minor. Forthe special case when the input directed graph is planar, the running time canbe improved to $2^{O(\sqrt{k})}n + n^{O(1)}$. The second example is ageneralization of the {\sc Directed Hamiltonian Path} problem, namely {\sc$k$-Internal Out-Branching}, which is to find an oriented spanning tree with atleast $k$ internal vertices. We obtain an algorithm solving the problem in time$2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)} + n^{O(1)}$ on directed graphs whose underlyingundirected graph excludes some fixed apex graph $H$ as a minor. Finally, weobserve that for any $\epsilon>0$, the {\sc $k$-Directed Path} problem issolvable in time $O((1+\epsilon)^k n^{f(\epsilon)})$, where $f$ is somefunction of $\ve$.  Our methods are based on non-trivial combinations of obstruction theorems forundirected graphs, kernelization, problem specific combinatorial structures anda layering technique similar to the one employed by Baker to obtain PTAS forplanar graphs.

Hitting forbidden minors: Approximation and Kernelization

  We study a general class of problems called F-deletion problems. In anF-deletion problem, we are asked whether a subset of at most $k$ vertices canbe deleted from a graph $G$ such that the resulting graph does not contain as aminor any graph from the family F of forbidden minors.  We obtain a number of algorithmic results on the F-deletion problem when Fcontains a planar graph. We give (1) a linear vertex kernel on graphs excluding$t$-claw $K_{1,t}$, the star with $t$ leves, as an induced subgraph, where $t$is a fixed integer. (2) an approximation algorithm achieving an approximationratio of $O(\log^{3/2} OPT)$, where $OPT$ is the size of an optimal solution ongeneral undirected graphs. Finally, we obtain polynomial kernels for the casewhen F contains graph $\theta_c$ as a minor for a fixed integer $c$. The graph$\theta_c$ consists of two vertices connected by $c$ parallel edges. Eventhough this may appear to be a very restricted class of problems it alreadyencompasses well-studied problems such as {\sc Vertex Cover}, {\sc FeedbackVertex Set} and Diamond Hitting Set. The generic kernelization algorithm isbased on a non-trivial application of protrusion techniques, previously usedonly for problems on topological graph classes.

Contracting Graphs to Paths and Trees

  Vertex deletion and edge deletion problems play a central role inParameterized Complexity. Examples include classical problems like FeedbackVertex Set, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Chordal Deletion. Interestingly, thestudy of edge contraction problems of this type from a parameterizedperspective has so far been left largely unexplored. We consider two basic edgecontraction problems, which we call Path-Contractibility andTree-Contractibility. Both problems take an undirected graph $G$ and an integer$k$ as input, and the task is to determine whether we can obtain a path or anacyclic graph, respectively, by contracting at most $k$ edges of $G$. Our maincontribution is an algorithm with running time $4^{k+O(\log^2 k)} + n^{O(1)}$for Path-Contractibility and an algorithm with running time $4.88^k n^{O(1)}$for Tree-Contractibility, based on a novel application of the color codingtechnique of Alon, Yuster and Zwick. Furthermore, we show thatPath-Contractibility has a kernel with at most $5k+3$ vertices, whileTree-Contractibility does not have a polynomial kernel unless coNP $\subseteq$NP/poly. We find the latter result surprising, because of the strong connectionbetween Tree-Contractibility and Feedback Vertex Set, which is known to have avertex kernel with size $O(k^2)$.

Parameterized Complexity of Directed Steiner Tree on Sparse Graphs

  We study the parameterized complexity of the directed variant of theclassical {\sc Steiner Tree} problem on various classes of directed sparsegraphs. While the parameterized complexity of {\sc Steiner Tree} parameterizedby the number of terminals is well understood, not much is known about theparameterization by the number of non-terminals in the solution tree. All thatis known for this parameterization is that both the directed and the undirectedversions are W[2]-hard on general graphs, and hence unlikely to be fixedparameter tractable FPT. The undirected {\sc Steiner Tree} problem becomes FPTwhen restricted to sparse classes of graphs such as planar graphs, but thetechniques used to show this result break down on directed planar graphs.  In this article we precisely chart the tractability border for {\sc DirectedSteiner Tree} (DST) on sparse graphs parameterized by the number ofnon-terminals in the solution tree. Specifically, we show that the problem isfixed parameter tractable on graphs excluding a topological minor, but becomesW[2]-hard on graphs of degeneracy 2. On the other hand we show that if thesubgraph induced by the terminals is required to be acyclic then the problembecomes FPT on graphs of bounded degeneracy.  We further show that our algorithm achieves the best possible running timedependence on the solution size and degeneracy of the input graph, understandard complexity theoretic assumptions. Using the ideas developed for DST,we also obtain improved algorithms for {\sc Dominating Set} on sparseundirected graphs. These algorithms are asymptotically optimal.

Irrelevant Vertices for the Planar Disjoint Paths Problem

  The Disjoint Paths Problem asks, given a graph $G$ and a set of pairs ofterminals $(s_{1},t_{1}),\ldots,(s_{k},t_{k})$, whether there is a collectionof $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint paths linking $s_{i}$ and $t_{i}$, for$i=1,\ldots,k.$ In their $f(k)\cdot n^{3}$ algorithm for this problem,Robertson and Seymour introduced the irrelevant vertex technique according towhich in every instance of treewidth greater than $g(k)$ there is an"irrelevant" vertex whose removal creates an equivalent instance of theproblem. This fact is based on the celebrated Unique Linkage Theorem, whose -very technical - proof gives a function $g(k)$ that is responsible for animmense parameter dependence in the running time of the algorithm. In thispaper we give a new and self-contained proof of this result that stronglyexploits the combinatorial properties of planar graphs and achieves$g(k)=O(k^{3/2}\cdot 2^{k}).$ Our bound is radically better than the boundsknown for general graphs.

On the Ordered List Subgraph Embedding Problems

  In the (parameterized) Ordered List Subgraph Embedding problem (p-OLSE) weare given two graphs $G$ and $H$, each with a linear order defined on itsvertices, a function $L$ that associates with every vertex in $G$ a list ofvertices in $H$, and a parameter $k$. The question is to decide if we can embed(one-to-one) a subgraph $S$ of $G$ of $k$ vertices into $H$ such that: (1)every vertex of $S$ is mapped to a vertex from its associated list, (2) thelinear orders inherited by $S$ and its image under the embedding are respected,and (3) if there is an edge between two vertices in $S$ then there is an edgebetween their images. If we require the subgraph $S$ to be embedded as aninduced subgraph, we obtain the Ordered List Induced Subgraph Embedding problem(p-OLISE). The p-OLSE and p-OLISE problems model various problems inBioinformatics related to structural comparison/alignment of proteins.  We investigate the complexity of p-OLSE and p-OLISE with respect to thefollowing structural parameters: the width $\Delta_L$ of the function $L$ (sizeof the largest list), and the maximum degree $\Delta_H$ of $H$ and $\Delta_G$of $G$. In terms of the structural parameters under consideration, we draw acomplete complexity landscape of p-OLSE and p-OLISE (and their optimizationversions) with respect to the computational frameworks of classical complexity,parameterized complexity, and approximation.

Parameterized Complexity of Bandwidth on Trees

  The bandwidth of a $n$-vertex graph $G$ is the smallest integer $b$ such thatthere exists a bijective function $f : V(G) \rightarrow \{1,...,n\}$, called alayout of $G$, such that for every edge $uv \in E(G)$, $|f(u) - f(v)| \leq b$.In the {\sc Bandwidth} problem we are given as input a graph $G$ and integer$b$, and asked whether the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $b$. We present tworesults concerning the parameterized complexity of the {\sc Bandwidth} problemon trees.  First we show that an algorithm for {\sc Bandwidth} with running time$f(b)n^{o(b)}$ would violate the Exponential Time Hypothesis, even if the inputgraphs are restricted to be trees of pathwidth at most two. Our lower boundshows that the classical $2^{O(b)}n^{b+1}$ time algorithm by Saxe [SIAM Journalon Algebraic and Discrete Methods, 1980] is essentially optimal.  Our second result is a polynomial time algorithm that given a tree $T$ andinteger $b$, either correctly concludes that the bandwidth of $T$ is more than$b$ or finds a layout of $T$ of bandwidth at most $b^{O(b)}$. This is the firstparameterized approximation algorithm for the bandwidth of trees.

Kernelization and Sparseness: the case of Dominating Set

  We prove that for every positive integer $r$ and for every graph class$\mathcal G$ of bounded expansion, the $r$-Dominating Set problem admits alinear kernel on graphs from $\mathcal G$. Moreover, when $\mathcal G$ is onlyassumed to be nowhere dense, then we give an almost linear kernel on $\mathcalG$ for the classic Dominating Set problem, i.e., for the case $r=1$. Theseresults generalize a line of previous research on finding linear kernels forDominating Set and $r$-Dominating Set. However, the approach taken in thiswork, which is based on the theory of sparse graphs, is radically different andconceptually much simpler than the previous approaches.  We complement our findings by showing that for the closely related ConnectedDominating Set problem, the existence of such kernelization algorithms isunlikely, even though the problem is known to admit a linear kernel on$H$-topological-minor-free graphs. Also, we prove that for any somewhere denseclass $\mathcal G$, there is some $r$ for which $r$-Dominating Set isW[$2$]-hard on $\mathcal G$. Thus, our results fall short of proving a sharpdichotomy for the parameterized complexity of $r$-Dominating Set onsubgraph-monotone graph classes: we conjecture that the border of tractabilitylies exactly between nowhere dense and somewhere dense graph classes.

Reconfiguration on sparse graphs

  A vertex-subset graph problem Q defines which subsets of the vertices of aninput graph are feasible solutions. A reconfiguration variant of avertex-subset problem asks, given two feasible solutions S and T of size k,whether it is possible to transform S into T by a sequence of vertex additionsand deletions such that each intermediate set is also a feasible solution ofsize bounded by k. We study reconfiguration variants of two classicalvertex-subset problems, namely Independent Set and Dominating Set. We denotethe former by ISR and the latter by DSR. Both ISR and DSR are PSPACE-completeon graphs of bounded bandwidth and W[1]-hard parameterized by k on generalgraphs. We show that ISR is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k whenthe input graph is of bounded degeneracy or nowhere-dense. As a corollary, weanswer positively an open question concerning the parameterized complexity ofthe problem on graphs of bounded treewidth. Moreover, our techniques generalizerecent results showing that ISR is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphsand graphs of bounded degree. For DSR, we show the problem fixed-parametertractable parameterized by k when the input graph does not contain largebicliques, a class of graphs which includes graphs of bounded degeneracy andnowhere-dense graphs.

FO Model Checking on Posets of Bounded Width

  Over the past two decades the main focus of research into first-order (FO)model checking algorithms have been sparse relational structures-culminating inthe FPT-algorithm by Grohe, Kreutzer and Siebertz for FO model checking ofnowhere dense classes of graphs [STOC'14], with dense structures starting toattract attention only recently. Bova, Ganian and Szeider [LICS'14] initiatedthe study of the complexity of FO model checking on partially ordered sets(posets). Bova, Ganian and Szeider showed that model checking existential FOlogic is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on posets of bounded width, where thewidth of a poset is the size of the largest antichain in the poset. Theexistence of an FPT algorithm for general FO model checking on posets ofbounded width, however, remained open. We resolve this question in the positiveby giving an algorithm that takes as its input an $n$-element poset $\cal P$ ofwidth $w$ and an FO logic formula $\phi$, and determines whether $\phi$ holdson $\cal P$ in time $f(\phi,w)\cdot n^2$.

Independence and Efficient Domination on $P_6$-free Graphs

  In the Independent set problem, the input is a graph $G$, every vertex has anon-negative integer weight, and the task is to find a set $S$ of pairwisenon-adjacent vertices, maximizing the total weight of the vertices in $S$. Wegive an $n^{O (\log^2 n)}$ time algorithm for this problem on graphs excludingthe path $P_6$ on $6$ vertices as an induced subgraph. Currently, there is noconstant $k$ known for which Independent Set on $P_{k}$-free graphs becomesNP-complete, and our result implies that if such a $k$ exists, then $k > 6$unless all problems in NP can be decided in (quasi)polynomial time.  Using the combinatorial tools that we develop for the above algorithm, wealso give a polynomial-time algorithm for Efficient Dominating Set on$P_6$-free graphs. In this problem, the input is a graph $G$, every vertex hasan integer weight, and the objective is to find a set $S$ of maximum weightsuch that every vertex in $G$ has exactly one vertex in $S$ in its closedneighborhood, or to determine that no such set exists. Prior to our work, theclass of $P_6$-free graphs was the only class of graphs defined by a singleforbidden induced subgraph on which the computational complexity of EfficientDominating Set was unknown.

A faster FPT Algorithm and a smaller Kernel for Block Graph Vertex  Deletion

  A graph $G$ is called a \emph{block graph} if each maximal $2$-connectedcomponent of $G$ is a clique. In this paper we study the Block Graph VertexDeletion from the perspective of fixed parameter tractable (FPT) andkernelization algorithm. In particular, an input to Block Graph Vertex Deletionconsists of a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$ and the objective to checkwhether there exists a subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such thatthe graph induced on $V(G)\setminus S$ is a block graph. In this paper we givean FPT algorithm with running time $4^kn^{O(1)}$ and a polynomial kernel ofsize $O(k^4)$ for Block Graph Vertex Deletion. The running time of our FPTalgorithm improves over the previous best algorithm for the problem that ran intime $10^kn^{O(1)}$ and the size of our kernel reduces over the previouslyknown kernel of size $O(k^9)$. Our results are based on a novel connectionbetween Block Graph Vertex Deletion and the classical {\sc Feedback Vertex Set}problem in graphs without induced $C_4$ and $K_4-e$. To achieve our results wealso obtain an algorithm for {\sc Weighted Feedback Vertex Set} running in time$3.618^kn^{O(1)}$ and improving over the running time of previously knownalgorithm with running time $5^kn^{O(1)}$.

Bidimensionality and Kernels

  Bidimensionality Theory was introduced by [E.D. Demaine, F.V. Fomin,M.Hajiaghayi, and D.M. Thilikos. Subexponential parameterized algorithms ongraphs of bounded genus and H-minor-free graphs, J. ACM, 52 (2005),pp.866--893] as a tool to obtain sub-exponential time parameterized algorithmson H-minor-free graphs. In [E.D. Demaine and M.Hajiaghayi, Bidimensionality:new connections between FPT algorithms and PTASs, in Proceedings of the 16thAnnual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), SIAM, 2005,pp.590--601] this theory was extended in order to obtain polynomial timeapproximation schemes (PTASs) for bidimensional problems. In this work, weestablish a third meta-algorithmic direction for bidimensionality theory byrelating it to the existence of linear kernels for parameterized problems. Inparticular, we prove that every minor (respectively contraction) bidimensionalproblem that satisfies a separation property and is expressible in CountableMonadic Second Order Logic (CMSO), admits a linear kernel for classes of graphsthat exclude a fixed graph (respectively an apex graph) H as a minor. Ourresults imply that a multitude of bidimensional problems g graph classes. Formost of these problems no polynomial kernels on H-minor-free graphs were knownprior to our work.
