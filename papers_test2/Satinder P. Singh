Knowledge Combination in Graphical Multiagent Model

  A graphical multiagent model (GMM) represents a joint distribution over thebehavior of a set of agents. One source of knowledge about agents' behavior maycome from gametheoretic analysis, as captured by several graphical gamerepresentations developed in recent years. GMMs generalize this approach toexpress arbitrary distributions, based on game descriptions or other sources ofknowledge bearing on beliefs about agent behavior. To illustrate theflexibility of GMMs, we exhibit game-derived models that allow probabilisticdeviation from equilibrium, as well as models based on heuristic action choice.We investigate three different methods of integrating these models into asingle model representing the combined knowledge sources. To evaluate thepredictive performance of the combined model, we treat as actual outcome thebehavior produced by a reinforcement learning process. We find that combiningthe two knowledge sources, using any of the methods, provides betterpredictions than either source alone. Among the combination methods, mixingdata outperforms the opinion pool and direct update methods investigated inthis empirical trial.
