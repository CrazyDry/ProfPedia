Using Game Theory to Study the Evolution of Cultural Norms

  We discuss how to use evolutionary game theory (EGT) as a framework forstudying how cultural dynamics and structural properties can influence theevolution of norms and behaviors within a society. We provide a brief tutorialon how EGT works, and discuss what kinds of insights it can provide. We thendescribe three published studies in which we have developed EGT models thathelp explain how structural and external conditions in a society affect theemergence of social norms.

Tipping Points for Norm Change in Human Cultures

  Humans interact with each other on a daily basis by developing andmaintaining various social norms and it is critical to form a deeperunderstanding of how such norms develop, how they change, and how fast theychange. In this work, we develop an evolutionary game-theoretic model based onresearch in cultural psychology that shows that humans in various culturesdiffer in their tendencies to conform with those around them. Using this model,we analyze the evolutionary relationships between the tendency to conform andhow quickly a population reacts when conditions make a change in normdesirable. Our analysis identifies conditions when a tipping point is reachedin a population, causing norms to change rapidly.

Understanding Norm Change: An Evolutionary Game-Theoretic Approach  (Extended Version)

  Human societies around the world interact with each other by developing andmaintaining social norms, and it is critically important to understand how suchnorms emerge and change. In this work, we define an evolutionary game-theoreticmodel to study how norms change in a society, based on the idea that differentstrength of norms in societies translate to different game-theoreticinteraction structures and incentives. We use this model to study, bothanalytically and with extensive agent-based simulations, the evolutionaryrelationships of the need for coordination in a society (which is related toits norm strength) with two key aspects of norm change: cultural inertia(whether or how quickly the population responds when faced with conditions thatmake a norm change desirable), and exploration rate (the willingness of agentsto try out new strategies). Our results show that a high need for coordinationleads to both high cultural inertia and a low exploration rate, while a lowneed for coordination leads to low cultural inertia and high exploration rate.This is the first work, to our knowledge, on understanding the evolutionarycausal relationships among these factors.
