Improving Christofides' Algorithm for the s-t Path TSP

  We present a deterministic (1+sqrt(5))/2-approximation algorithm for the s-tpath TSP for an arbitrary metric. Given a symmetric metric cost on n verticesincluding two prespecified endpoints, the problem is to find a shortestHamiltonian path between the two endpoints; Hoogeveen showed that the naturalvariant of Christofides' algorithm is a 5/3-approximation algorithm for thisproblem, and this asymptotically tight bound in fact has been the bestapproximation ratio known until now. We modify this algorithm so that itchooses the initial spanning tree based on an optimal solution to the Held-Karprelaxation rather than a minimum spanning tree; we prove this simple butcrucial modification leads to an improved approximation ratio, surpassing the20-year-old barrier set by the natural Christofides' algorithm variant. Ouralgorithm also proves an upper bound of (1+sqrt(5))/2 on the integrality gap ofthe path-variant Held-Karp relaxation. The techniques devised in this paper canbe applied to other optimization problems as well: these applications includeimproved approximation algorithms and improved LP integrality gap upper boundsfor the prize-collecting s-t path problem and the unit-weight graphical metrics-t path TSP.

A Primal-Dual Approximation Algorithm for Min-Sum Single-Machine  Scheduling Problems

  We consider the following single-machine scheduling problem, which is oftendenoted $1||\sum f_{j}$: we are given $n$ jobs to be scheduled on a singlemachine, where each job $j$ has an integral processing time $p_j$, and there isa nondecreasing, nonnegative cost function $f_j(C_{j})$ that specifies the costof finishing $j$ at time $C_{j}$; the objective is to minimize $\sum_{j=1}^nf_j(C_j)$. Bansal \& Pruhs recently gave the first constant approximationalgorithm with a performance guarantee of 16. We improve on this result bygiving a primal-dual pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm based on the recentlyintroduced knapsack-cover inequalities. The algorithm finds a schedule of costat most four times the constructed dual solution. Although we show that thisbound is tight for our algorithm, we leave open the question of whether theintegrality gap of the LP is less than 4. Finally, we show how the techniquecan be adapted to yield, for any $\epsilon >0$, a $(4+\epsilon )$-approximationalgorithm for this problem.

Minimizing Multimodular Functions and Allocating Capacity in  Bike-Sharing Systems

  The growing popularity of bike-sharing systems around the world has motivatedrecent attention to models and algorithms for the effective operation of thesesystems. Most of this literature focuses on their daily operation for managingasymmetric demand. In this work, we consider the more strategic question of howto (re-)allocate dock-capacity in such systems. We develop mathematicalformulations for variations of this problem (service performance over thecourse of one day, long-run- average performance) and exhibit discrete convexproperties in associated optimization problems. This allows us to design apractically fast polynomial-time allocation algorithm to compute optimalsolutions for this problem, which can also handle practically motivatedconstraints, such as a limit on the number of docks moved in the system.  We apply our algorithm to data sets from Boston, New York City, and Chicagoto investigate how different dock allocations can yield better service in thesesystems. Recommendations based on our analysis have been adopted by systemoperators in Boston and New York City. Beyond optimizing for improved qualityof service through better allocations, our results also quantify the reductionin rebalancing achievable through strategically reallocating docks.
