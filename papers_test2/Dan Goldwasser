Ask, and shall you receive?: Understanding Desire Fulfillment in Natural  Language Text

  The ability to comprehend wishes or desires and their fulfillment isimportant to Natural Language Understanding. This paper introduces the task ofidentifying if a desire expressed by a subject in a given short piece of textwas fulfilled. We propose various unstructured and structured models thatcapture fulfillment cues such as the subject's emotional state and actions. Ourexperiments with two different datasets demonstrate the importance ofunderstanding the narrative and discourse structure to address this task.

Leveraging Textual Specifications for Grammar-based Fuzzing of Network  Protocols

  Grammar-based fuzzing is a technique used to find software vulnerabilities byinjecting well-formed inputs generated following rules that encode applicationsemantics. Most grammar-based fuzzers for network protocols rely on humanexperts to manually specify these rules. In this work we study automatedlearning of protocol rules from textual specifications (i.e. RFCs). We evaluatethe automatically extracted protocol rules by applying them to astate-of-the-art fuzzer for transport protocols and show that it leads to asmaller number of test cases while finding the same attacks as the system thatuses manually specified rules.
