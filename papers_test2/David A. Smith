  We report a corrigendum to the paper 'Viscous propulsion in activetransversely-isotropic media' [J. Fluid Mech. 812, 501-524, 2017 / arxiv1608.01451].

Smith Ideals of Operadic Algebras in Monoidal Model Categories

  Building upon Hovey's work on Smith ideals for monoids, we develop a homotopytheory of Smith ideals for general operads in a symmetric monoidal category.For a sufficiently nice stable monoidal model category and an operad satisfyinga cofibrancy condition, we show that there is a Quillen equivalence between amodel structure on Smith ideals and a model structure on algebra maps inducedby the cokernel and the kernel. For symmetric spectra this applies to thecommutative operad and all Sigma-cofibrant operads. For chain complexes over afield of characteristic zero and the stable module category, this Quillenequivalence holds for all operads.

Smith theory and geometric Hecke algebras

  In 1960 Borel proved a "localization" result relating the rational cohomologyof a topological space X to the rational cohomology of the fixed points for atorus action on X. This result and its generalizations have many applicationsin Lie theory. In 1934, P. Smith proved a similar localization result relatingthe mod p cohomology of X to the mod p cohomology of the fixed points for aZ/p-action on X. In this paper we study Z/p-localization ("Smith theory") forconstructible sheaves and functions. We show that Smith theory on loop groupsis related via the geometric Satake correspondence to some specialhomomorphisms that exist between algebraic groups defined over a field of smallcharacteristic.

On tilting modules over cluster-tilted algebras

  In this paper, we show that the tilting modules over a cluster-tilted algebra$A$ lift to tilting objects in the associated cluster category $\mathcal{C}_H$.As a first application, we describe the induced exchange relation for tilting$A$-modules arising from the exchange relation for tilting object in$\mathcal{C}_H$. As a second application, we exhibit tilting $A$-modules havingcluster-tilted endomorphism algebras.

Jordan and Smith forms of Pascal-related matrices

  We present matrix identities which yield respectively the Jordan canonicalform of the Pascal matrix P_n = (i -1 choose j -1)_{1 <= i,j <= n} modulo aprime, the eigenvectors of (i choose j)_{1 <= i,j <= n}, and the Smith normalform of powers of P_n - I_n.

Functoriality, Smith theory, and the Brauer homomorphism

  If $\sigma$ is an automorphism of order $p$ of the semisimple group$\mathbf{G}$, there is a natural correspondence between mod $p$ cohomologicalautomorphic forms on $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{G}^\sigma$. We describe thiscorrespondence in the global and local settings.

Filtering subcategories of modules of an artinian algebra

  Let $A$ be an artinian algebra, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a subcategory ofmod$A$ that is closed under extensions. When $\mathcal{C}$ is closed underkernels of epimorphisms (or closed under cokernels of monomorphisms), wedescribe the smallest class of modules that filters $\mathcal{C}$. As aconsequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for the finitistic dimension of analgebra over a field to be finite. We also apply our results to the torsionpairs. In particular, when a torsion pair is induced by a tilting module, weshow that the smallest classes of modules that filter the torsion andtorsion-free classes are completely compatible with the quasi-equivalences ofBrenner and Butler.

Well-posed two-point initial-boundary value problems with arbitrary  boundary conditions

  We study initial-boundary value problems for linear evolution equations ofarbitrary spatial order, subject to arbitrary linear boundary conditions andposed on a rectangular 1-space, 1-time domain. We give a new characterisationof the boundary conditions that specify well-posed problems using Fokas'transform method. We also give a sufficient condition guaranteeing that thesolution can be represented using a series.  The relevant condition, the analyticity at infinity of certain meromorphicfunctions within particular sectors, is significantly more concrete and easierto test than the previous criterion, based on the existence of admissiblefunctions.

Skew group algebras of piecewise hereditary algebras are piecewise  hereditary

  We show that the main results of Happel-Rickard-Schofield (1988) andHappel-Reiten-Smalo (1996) on piecewise hereditary algebras are coherent withthe notion of group action on an algebra. Then, we take advantage of thiscompatibility and show that if G is a finite group acting on a piecewisehereditary algebra A over an algebraically closed field whose characteristicdoes not divide the order of G, then the resulting skew group algebra A[G] isalso piecewise hereditary.

Friezes, Strings and Cluster Variables

  To any walk in a quiver, we associate a Laurent polynomial. When the walk isthe string of a string module over a 2-Calabi-Yau tilted algebra, we prove thatthis Laurent polynomial coincides with the corresponding cluster character ofthe string module, up to an explicit normalising monomial factor.

Well-posedness and conditioning of 3rd and higher order two-point  initial-boundary value problems

  We discuss initial-boundary value problems of arbitrary spatial order subjectto arbitrary boundary conditions. We formalise the concept of the conditioningof such a problem and show that it represents a necessary criterion forwell-posedness. The other requirement for well-posedness, the convergence ofcertain series, is also analysed. We illustrate these results with a fullclassification of 3rd order problems having non-Robin boundary conditions.  Part of this work is devoted to correcting an oversight in the author'searlier work Well-posed two-point initial-boundary value problems witharbitrary boundary conditions in volume 152 of Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc.

First-fit coloring on interval graphs has performance ratio at least 5

  First-fit is the online graph coloring algorithm that considers vertices oneat a time in some order and assigns each vertex the least positive integer notused already on a neighbor. The maximum number of colors used by first-fit ongraph G over all vertex orders is denoted \chi_{FF}(G).  The exact value of R := \sup_G [\chi_{FF}(G) / \omega(G)] over intervalgraphs G is unknown. Pemmaraju, Raman, and Varadarajan (2004) proved R <= 10,and this can be improved to 8. Witsenhausen (1976) and Chrobak and \'Slusarek(1988) showed R >= 4, and \'Slusarek (1993) improved this to 4.45. We prove R>= 5.

Review of the Solar Array Telescopes

  For several years the only experiments sensitive to astrophysical gamma rayswith energies beyond the reach of EGRET but below that of the Cherenkov imagingtelescopes have been the "solar tower" detectors. They use >2000 m2 mirrorareas to sample the Cherenkov wavefront generated by <100 GeV gamma rays,obtaining Crab sensitivities of more than 6$\sigma$ in one ON-source hour. Iwill review the history of the solar tower Cherenkov experiments from 1992 tothe present and their key design features. I will describe some successfulanalysis strategies, then summarize the principal results obtained.

Infinite friezes and triangulations of the strip

  The infinite friezes of positive integers were introduced by Tschabold as avariation of the classical Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns. These infinitefriezes were further shown be to realizable via triangulations of the infinitestrip by Baur, Parsons and Tschabold. In this paper, we show that theconstruction of Baur, Parsons and Tschabold can be slightly adapted in order toobtain a bijection between the infinite friezes and the so-called admissibletriangulations of the infinite strip with no special marked points on the upperboundary. As a consequence, we obtain that the infinite friezes with enoughones are in bijection with the admissible triangulations of the infinity-gon.

Calibrations and Fayyazuddin-Smith Spacetimes

  We show that a class of spacetimes introduced by Fayyazuddin and Smith todescribe intersecting M5-branes admit a generalized Kahler calibration.Equipped with this understanding, we are able to construct spacetimescorresponding to further classes of calibrated $p$-brane world-volume solitons.We note that these classes of spacetimes also describe the fields of $p$-braneswrapping certain supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds.

Measuring and manipulating the temperature of cold molecules trapped on  a chip

  We demonstrate the measurement and manipulation of the temperature of cold COmolecules in a microchip environment. Through the use of time-resolved spatialimaging, we are able to observe the phase-space distribution of the molecules,and hence deduce the corresponding temperature. We do this both by observingthe expansion of the molecular ensemble in time and through the use ofnumerical trajectory simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the adiabaticcooling of the trapped molecular sample and discuss this process.

The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager observation of  the 1809 keV line from Galactic 26Al

  Observations of the central radian of the Galaxy by the Reuven Ramaty HighEnergy Solar Spectroscopy Imager (RHESSI) have yielded a high-resolutionmeasurement of the 1809 keV line from 26Al, detected at 11 sigma significancein nine months of data. The RHESSI result for the width of the cosmic line is2.03 (+0.78, -1.21) keV FWHM. The best fit line width of 5.4 keV FWHM reportedby Naya et al. (1996) using the Gamma-Ray Imaging Spectrometer (GRIS) ballooninstrument is rejected with high confidence.

Approximations of injective modules and finitistic dimension

  Let $\Lambda$ be an artin algebra and let $\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$ thecategory of finitely generated right $\Lambda$-modules of finite projectivedimension. We show that $\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$ is contravariantlyfinite in $\rm mod\,\Lambda$ if and only if the direct sum $E$ of theindecomposable Ext-injective modules in $\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$ form atilting module in $\rm mod\,\Lambda$. Moreover, we show that in this case $E$coincides with the direct sum of the minimal right$\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$-approximations of the indecomposable$\Lambda$-injective modules and that the projective dimension of $E$ equal tothe finitistic dimension of $\Lambda$.

A Search For Star Formation in the Smith Cloud

  Motivated by the idea that a subset of HVCs trace dark matter substructure inthe Local Group, we search for signs of star formation in the Smith Cloud, anearby ~2x10^6 Msun HVC currently falling into the Milky Way. Using GALEX NUVand WISE/2MASS NIR photometry, we apply a series of color and apparentmagnitude cuts to isolate candidate O and B stars that are plausibly associatedwith the Smith Cloud. We find an excess of stars along the line of sight to thecloud, but not at a statistically significant level relative to a controlregion. The number of stars found in projection on the cloud after removing anestimate of the contamination by the Milky Way implies an average starformation rate surface density of 10^(-4.8 +/- 0.3) Msun yr^(-1) kpc^(-2),assuming the cloud has been forming stars at a constant rate since its firstpassage through the Milky Way ~70 Myr ago. This value is consistent with thestar formation rate expected based on the average gas density of the cloud. Wealso discuss how the newly discovered star forming galaxy Leo P has verysimilar properties to the Smith Cloud, but its young stellar population wouldnot have been detected at a statistically significant level using our method.Thus, we cannot yet rule out the idea that the Smith Cloud is really a dwarfgalaxy.

Hard X-ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors

  The detection of photons above 10 keV through MeV and GeV energies ischallenging due to the penetrating nature of the radiation, which can requirelarge detector volumes, resulting in correspondingly high background. In thisenergy range, most detectors in space are either scintillators or solid-statedetectors. The choice of detector technology depends on the energy range ofinterest, expected levels of signal and background, required energy and spatialresolution, particle environment on orbit, and other factors. This sectioncovers the materials and configurations commonly used from 10 keV to > 1 GeV.

Almost laura algebras

  In this paper, we propose a generalization for the class of laura algebras,which we call almost laura. We show that this new class of algebras retainsmost of the essential features of laura algebras, especially concerning theimportant role played by the non-semiregular components in theirAuslander-Reiten quivers. Also, we study more intensively the left supportedalmost laura algebras, showing that these are characterized by the presence ofa generalized standard, convex and faithful component. Finally, we prove thatalmost laura algebras behave well with respect to full subcategories,split-by-nilpotent extensions and skew group algebras.

Risks due to X-ray Flares during Astronaut Extravehicular Activity

  Solar hard X-ray flares can expose astronauts on lunar and deep spaceextravehicular activities (EVAs) to dangerous acute biological doses. Wecombine calculations of radiative transfer through shielding materials withsubsequent transfer through tissue to show that hazardous doses, taken as >=0.1 Gy, should occur with a probability of about 10% per 100 hours ofaccumulated EVA inside current spacesuits. The rapid onset and short durationof X-ray flares and the lack of viable precursor events require strategies forquick retreat, in contrast to solar proton events, which usually take hours todeliver significant fluence and can often be anticipated by flares or otherlight-speed precursors. Our results contrast with the view that only particleradiation poses dangers for human space exploration. Heavy-element shieldsprovide the most efficient protection from X-ray flares, since X-rays produceno significant secondary radiation. We calculate doses due to X-ray flaresbehind aluminum shields and estimate the required shield masses to accompanyEVA rovers.

Heat equation on a network using the Fokas method

  The problem of heat conduction on networks of multiply connected rods issolved by providing an explicit solution of the one-dimensional heat equationin each domain. The size and connectivity of the rods is known, but neithertemperature nor heat flux are prescribed at the interface. Instead, thephysical assumptions of continuity at the interfaces are the only conditionsimposed. This work generalizes that of Deconinck, Pelloni, and Sheils, 2014,for heat conduction on a series of one-dimensional rods connected end-to-end tothe case of general configurations.

Astrophysics with HESSI

  In the summer of the year 2000, a NASA Small Explorer satellite, the HighEnergy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (HESSI), will be launched. It will consist ofnine large, coaxial germanium detectors viewing the Sun through a set ofRotation Modulation Collimators and will accomplish high-resolution imaging andspectroscopy of solar flares in the x-ray and gamma-ray bands. Here we describesome of the astrophysical observations HESSI will also perform in addition toits solar mission.

Spectropolarimetry and the Geometry of Type 1 Seyfert Nuclei

  We describe the results of a detailed study of the polarization properties ofthe broad H-alpha emission line in Type 1 Seyfert nuclei. Our analysis of thesedata points to a model in which the broad Balmer lines are emitted by arotating disk, and are scattered in two main regions - one co-planar with thedisk and within the circum-nuclear torus, the other, the polar scatteringregion, outside the torus but aligned with its axis. The relative importance ofthe two sources of polarized light is largely determined by the inclination ofthe system axis to the line-of-sight.

Counting Points on Genus 2 Curves with Real Multiplication

  We present an accelerated Schoof-type point-counting algorithm for curves ofgenus 2 equipped with an efficiently computable real multiplicationendomorphism. Our new algorithm reduces the complexity of genus 2 pointcounting over a finite field (\F_{q}) of large characteristic from(\widetilde{O}(\log^8 q)) to (\widetilde{O}(\log^5 q)). Using our algorithm wecompute a 256-bit prime-order Jacobian, suitable for cryptographicapplications, and also the order of a 1024-bit Jacobian.

The Smith and critical groups of Paley graphs

  There is a Paley graph for each prime power $q$ such that $q\equiv 1\pmod 4$.The vertex set is the field $\mathbb Fq$ and two vertices $x$ and $y$ arejoined by an edge if and only if $x-y$ is a nonzero square of $\mathbb Fq$. Wecompute the Smith normal forms of the adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix ofa Paley graph.

Comonad Cohomology of Track Categories

  We define a comonad cohomology of track categories and we show it is linkedby a long exact sequence to its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology . Under mildhypothesis on the track category, we show that its comonad cohomologycoincides, up to dimension shift, with its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology,therefore obtaining an algebraic formulation of the latter. We also specializeour results to the case where the track category is a $2$-groupoid.

Bose-Einstein condensation as symmetry breaking in compact curved  spacetimes

  We examine Bose-Einstein condensation as a form of symmetry breaking in thespecific model of the Einstein static universe. We show that symmetry breakingnever occursin the sense that the chemical potential $\mu$ never reaches itscritical value.This leads us to some statements about spaces of finite volumein general. In an appendix we clarify the relationship between the standardstatistical mechanical approaches and the field theory method using zetafunctions.

Hysteresis of spectral evolution in the soft state of black-hole binary  LMC X-3

  We report the discovery of hysteresis between the x-ray spectrum andluminosity of black-hole binary LMC X-3. Our observations, with theProportional Counter Array on the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, took placeentirely within the soft spectral state, dominated by a spectral component thatwas fitted well with a multicolor disk blackbody. A power-law component wasseen only during times when the luminosity of the disk blackbody was declining.The x-ray luminosity at these times was comparable to that seen in transientsystems (x-ray novae) when they return to the hard state at the end of anoutburst. Our observations may represent partial transitions to the hard state;complete transitions have been seen in this system by Wilms et al. (2001). Ifthey are related to the soft-to-hard transition in transients, then theydemonstrate that hysteresis effects can appear without a full state transition.We discuss these observations in the context of earlier observations ofhysteresis within the hard state of binaries 1E 1740.7-2942 and GRS 1758-258and in relation to published explanations of hysteresis in transients.

On the influence of radio galaxies on cooling flows: M87 and Cygnus A

  Results from Chandra studies of the intracluster medium around M87 and CygnusA are summarized.

Stability Conditions and Maximal Green Sequences in Abelian Categories

  In this paper we study the stability functions on abelian categoriesintroduced by Rudakov in \cite{Ru} and their relation with torsion classes andmaximal green sequences. Moreover we introduce a new kind of stability functionusing the wall and chamber structure of the category.

New Alignment Methods for Discriminative Book Summarization

  We consider the unsupervised alignment of the full text of a book with ahuman-written summary. This presents challenges not seen in other textalignment problems, including a disparity in length and, consequent to this, aviolation of the expectation that individual words and phrases should align,since large passages and chapters can be distilled into a single summaryphrase. We present two new methods, based on hidden Markov models, specificallytargeted to this problem, and demonstrate gains on an extractive booksummarization task. While there is still much room for improvement,unsupervised alignment holds intrinsic value in offering insight into whatfeatures of a book are deemed worthy of summarization.

Comparing cohomology obstructions

  We show that three different kinds of cohomology - Baues-Wirschingcohomology, the (S,O)-cohomology of Dwyer-Kan, and the Andre-Quillen cohomologyof a Pi-algebra - are isomorphic, under certain assumptions.  This is then used to identify the cohomological obstructions in three generalapproaches to realizability problems: the track category version ofBaues-Wirsching, the diagram rectifications of Dwyer-Kan-Smith, and thePi-Algebra realization of Dwyer-Kan-Stover. Our main tool in thisidentification is the notion of a mapping algebra: a simplicially enrichedversion of an algebra over a theory.

Single-Class Genera of Positive Integral Lattices

  We give an enumeration of all positive definite primitive Z-lattices indimension >= 3 whose genus consists of a single isometry class. This isachieved by using bounds obtained from the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formulato computationally construct the square-free determinant lattices with thisproperty, and then repeatedly calculating pre-images under a mapping firstintroduced by G. L. Watson. We hereby complete the classification ofsingle-class genera in dimensions 4 and 5 and correct some mistakes in Watson'sclassifications in other dimensions. A list of all single-class primitiveZ-lattices has been compiled and incorporated into the Catalogue of Lattices.

A new and improved ephemeris for the hot subdwarf eclipsing binary SDSS  J082053.53+000843.4

  SDSS J082053.53+000843.4 belongs to the HW Vir family of short period binarysystems and was first identified by Geier in 2011. Whilst three subsequentpapers have focused on the morphology of this system, little has been publishedon the system period and its constancy. Here we provide the first publishedtimes of minima together with a revised ephemeris and a binary period,0.0962404(1)d, that is four orders of magnitude more precise than previousdeclared values.

IGR J17544-2619 in depth with Suzaku: direct evidence for clumpy winds  in a supergiant fast X-ray transient

  We present the first direct evidence for dense clumps of matter in thecompanion wind in a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) binary. This is seenas a brief period of enhanced absorption during one of the bright, fast flaresthat distinguish these systems. The object under study was IGR J17544-2619, anda total of 236 ks of data were accumulated with the Japanese satellite Suzaku.The activity in this period spans a dynamic range of almost 10000 in luminosityand gives a detailed look at SFXT behavior.

Frises

  Each acyclic graph, and more generally, each acyclic orientation of the graphassociated to a Cartan matrix, allows to define a so-called frise; this is acollection of sequences over the positive natural numbers, one for each vertexof the graph. We prove that if these sequences satisfy a linear recurrence,then the Cartan matrix is of Dynkin type (if the sequences are bounded) or ofEuclidean type (if the sequences are unbounded). We prove the converse in allcases, except for the exceptional Euclidean Cartan matrices; we show even thatthe sequences are rational over the positive natural numbers. We generalizethese results by considering frises with variables; as a byproduct we obtain,for the Dynkin and Euclidean type A cases, explicit formulas for the clustervariables, over the semiring of Laurent polynomials over the positive naturalnumbers generated by the initial variables (which explains simultaneouslypositivity and the Laurent phenomenon). The general tool are the so-calledSL_2-tilings of the plane; these are fillings of the whole discrete plane byelements of a ring, in such a way that each 2 by 2 connected submatrix is ofdeterminant 1.

Quantum-Noise-Limited Sensitivity-Enhancement of a Passive Optical  Cavity by a Fast-Light Medium

  We demonstrate for a passive optical cavity containing a dispersive atomicmedium, the increase in scale factor near the critical anomalous dispersion isnot cancelled by mode broadening or attenuation, resulting in an overallincrease in the predicted quantum-noise-limited sensitivity. Enhancements ofover two orders of magnitude are measured in the scale factor, which translatesto greater than an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the predictedquantum-noise-limited measurement precision, by temperature tuning alow-pressure vapor of non-interacting atoms in a low-finesse cavity close tothe critical anomalous dispersion condition. The predicted enhancement insensitivity is confirmed through Monte-Carlo numerical simulations.

Charge Pumping in Carbon Nanotubes

  We demonstrate charge pumping in semiconducting carbon nanotubes by atraveling potential wave. From the observation of pumping in the nanotubeinsulating state we deduce that transport occurs by packets of charge beingcarried along by the wave. By tuning the potential of a side gate, transport ofeither electron or hole packets can be realized. Prospects for the realizationof nanotube based single-electron pumps are discussed.

Spectral theory of some non-selfadjoint linear differential operators

  We give a characterisation of the spectral properties of linear differentialoperators with constant coefficients, acting on functions defined on a boundedinterval, and determined by general linear boundary conditions. The boundaryconditions may be such that the resulting operator is not selfadjoint.  We associate the spectral properties of such an operator $S$ with theproperties of the solution of a corresponding boundary value problem for thepartial differential equation $\partial_t q \pm iSq=0$. Namely, we are able toestablish an explicit correspondence between the properties of the family ofeigenfunctions of the operator, and in particular whether this family is abasis, and the existence and properties of the unique solution of theassociated boundary value problem. When such a unique solution exists, weconsider its representation as a complex contour integral that is obtainedusing a transform method recently proposed by Fokas and one of the authors. Theanalyticity properties of the integrand in this representation are crucial forstudying the spectral theory of the associated operator.

The Cantor-Bendixson Rank of Certain Bridgeland-Smith Stability  Conditions

  We provide a novel proof that the set of directions that admit a saddleconnection on a meromorphic quadratic differential with at least one pole oforder at least two is closed, which generalizes a result of Bridgeland andSmith, and Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke. Secondly, we show that this set hasfinite Cantor-Bendixson rank and give a tight bound. Finally, we present afamily of surfaces realizing all possible Cantor-Bendixson ranks. Thetechniques in the proof of this result exclusively concern Abeliandifferentials on Riemann surfaces, also known as translation surfaces. Theconcept of a "slit translation surface" is introduced as the primary tool forstudying meromorphic quadratic differentials with higher order poles.

The diffusion equation with nonlocal data

  We study the diffusion (or heat) equation on a finite 1-dimensional spatialdomain, but we replace one of the boundary conditions with a "nonlocalcondition", through which we specify a weighted average of the solution overthe spatial interval. We provide conditions on the regularity of both the dataand weight for the problem to admit a unique solution, and also provide asolution representation in terms of contour integrals. The solution andwell-posedness results rely upon an extension of the Fokas (or unified)transform method to initial-nonlocal value problems for linear equations; thenecessary extensions are described in detail. Despite arising naturally fromthe Fokas transform method, the uniqueness argument appears to be novel evenfor initial-boundary value problems.

X-ray Emission from Isolated Be Stars

  I discuss the X-ray observations of Be stars, and how their propertiescompare to non-emission B stars. I focus on several specific stars that showhigh flux levels and variability but also report on several interesting surveyresults. The Be X-ray properties are discussed in the context of wind-shockX-ray emission from normal OB stars as well as in the context of generalmechanisms that have been proposed to explain the Be phenomenon. Finally, Iconclude with a discussion of the spectral diagnostics that will be availablefrom the new generation of X-ray telescopes.

Regularity of volume-minimizing flows on 3-manifolds

  In this article, we show that, for any compact 3-manifold, there is a $C^{1}$volume-minimizing one-dimensional foliation. More generally, we show theexistence of mass-minimizing rectifiable sections of sphere bundles withoutisolated "pole points" in the base manifold. This same analysis is used to showthat the examples, due to Sharon Pedersen, of potentially volume-minimizingrectifiable sections (rectifiable foliations) of the unit tangent bundle to$S^{2n+1}$ are not, in fact, volume minimizing.

Exactness of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantisation for two non-central potentials

  In this paper we demonstrate the integrability of the Hamilton-Jacobiequation for two non-central potentials in spherical polar coordinates, andpresent complete solutions for the classically bound orbits. We then show thatthe semiclassical method of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantisation exactly reproduces thebound state spectra of the corresponding quantum mechanical Schr\"odingerequations. One of these potentials has previously been analysed in paraboliccoordinates; the results for the other are, to the authors' best knowledge,original.

Inelastic Dark Matter

  Many observations suggest that much of the matter of the universe isnon-baryonic. Recently, the DAMA NaI dark matter direct detection experimentreported an annual modulation in their event rate consistent with a WIMP relic.However, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Ge experiment excludes most ofthe region preferred by DAMA. We demonstrate that if the dark matter can onlyscatter by making a transition to a slightly heavier state (Delta m ~ 100kev),the experiments are no longer in conflict. Moreover, differences in the energyspectrum of nuclear recoil events could distinguish such a scenario from thestandard WIMP scenario. Finally, we discuss the sneutrino as a candidate forinelastic dark matter in supersymmetric theories.

Network Automata: Coupling structure and function in real-world networks

  We introduce Network Automata, a framework which couples the topologicalevolution of a network to its structure. It is useful for dealing with networksin which the topology evolves according to some specified microscopic rulesand, simultaneously, there is a dynamic process taking place on the networkthat both depends on its structure but is also capable of modifying it. It is ageneric framework for modeling systems in which network structure, dynamics,and function are interrelated. At the practical level, this framework allowsfor easy implementation of the microscopic rules involved in such systems. Todemonstrate the approach, we develop a class of simple biologically inspiredmodels of fungal growth.

Accelerating networks

  Evolving out-of-equilibrium networks have been under intense scrutinyrecently. In many real-world settings the number of links added per new node isnot constant but depends on the time at which the node is introduced in thesystem. This simple idea gives rise to the concept of accelerating networks,for which we review an existing definition and -- after finding it somewhatconstrictive -- offer a new definition. The new definition provided here viewsnetwork acceleration as a time dependent property of a given system, as opposedto being a property of the specific algorithm applied to grow the network. Thedefnition also covers both unweighted and weighted networks. As time-stampednetwork data becomes increasingly available, the proposed measures may beeasily carried out on empirical datasets. As a simple case study we apply theconcepts to study the evolution of three different instances of Wikipedia,namely, those in English, German, and Japanese, and find that the networksundergo different acceleration regimes in their evolution.

Surface accumulation of spermatozoa: a fluid dynamic phenomenon

  Recent mathematical fluid dynamics models have shed light into an outstandingproblem in reproductive biology: why do spermatozoa cells show a 'preference'for swimming near to surfaces? In this paper we review quantitative approachesto the problem, originating with the classic paper of Lord Rothschild in 1963.A recent 'boundary integral/slender body theory' mathematical model for thefluid dynamics is described, and we discuss how it gives insight into themechanisms that may be responsible for the surface accumulation behaviour. Weuse the simulation model to explore these mechanisms in more detail, anddiscuss whether simplified models can capture the behaviour of sperm cells. Thefar-field decay of the fluid flow around the cell is calculated, and comparedwith a stresslet model. Finally we present some new findings showing how,despite having a relatively small hydrodynamic drag, the sperm cell 'head' hasvery significant effects on surface accumulation and trajectory.
