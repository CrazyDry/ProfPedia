Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of a Parallel Boosting Algorithm

  Many real-world problems involve massive amounts of data. Under thesecircumstances learning algorithms often become prohibitively expensive, makingscalability a pressing issue to be addressed. A common approach is to performsampling to reduce the size of the dataset and enable efficient learning.Alternatively, one customizes learning algorithms to achieve scalability. Ineither case, the key challenge is to obtain algorithmic efficiency withoutcompromising the quality of the results. In this paper we discuss ameta-learning algorithm (PSBML) which combines features of parallel algorithmswith concepts from ensemble and boosting methodologies to achieve the desiredscalability property. We present both theoretical and empirical analyses whichshow that PSBML preserves a critical property of boosting, specifically,convergence to a distribution centered around the margin. We then presentadditional empirical analyses showing that this meta-level algorithm provides ageneral and effective framework that can be used in combination with a varietyof learning classifiers. We perform extensive experiments to investigate thetradeoff achieved between scalability and accuracy, and robustness to noise, onboth synthetic and real-world data. These empirical results corroborate ourtheoretical analysis, and demonstrate the potential of PSBML in achievingscalability without sacrificing accuracy.

Network-based Anomaly Detection for Insider Trading

  Insider trading is one of the numerous white collar crimes that cancontribute to the instability of the economy. Traditionally, the detection ofillegal insider trades has been a human-driven process. In this paper, wecollect the insider tradings made available by the US Securities and ExchangeCommissions (SEC) through the EDGAR system, with the aim of initiating anautomated large-scale and data-driven approach to the problem of identifyingillegal insider tradings. The goal of the study is the identification ofinteresting patterns, which can be indicators of potential anomalies. We usethe collected data to construct networks that capture the relationship betweentrading behaviors of insiders. We explore different ways of building networksfrom insider trading data, and argue for a need of a structure that is capableof capturing higher order relationships among traders. Our results suggest thediscovery of interesting patterns.

A New Framework for Centrality Measures in Multiplex Networks

  The non-trivial structure of such complex systems makes the analysis of theircollective behavior a challenge. The problem is even more difficult when theinformation is distributed across networks (e.g., communication networks indifferent media); in this case, it becomes impossible to have a complete, oreven partial picture, if situations are analyzed separately within each networkdue to sparsity. A multiplex network is well-suited to model the complexity ofthis kind of systems by preserving the semantics associated with each network.Centrality measures are fundamental for the identification of key players, butexisting approaches are typically designed to capture a predefined aspect ofthe system, ignoring or merging the semantics of the individual layers.

Graph-based Selective Outlier Ensembles

  An ensemble technique is characterized by the mechanism that generates thecomponents and by the mechanism that combines them. A common way to achieve theconsensus is to enable each component to equally participate in the aggregationprocess. A problem with this approach is that poor components are likely tonegatively affect the quality of the consensus result. To address this issue,alternatives have been explored in the literature to build selective classifierand cluster ensembles, where only a subset of the components contributes to thecomputation of the consensus. Of the family of ensemble methods, outlierensembles are the least studied. Only recently, the selection problem foroutlier ensembles has been discussed. In this work we define a new graph-basedclass of ranking selection methods. A method in this class is characterized bytwo main steps: (1) Mapping the rankings onto a graph structure; and (2) Miningthe resulting graph to identify a subset of rankings. We define a specificinstance of the graph-based ranking selection class. Specifically, we map theproblem of selecting ensemble components onto a mining problem in a graph. Anextensive evaluation was conducted on a variety of heterogeneous data andmethods. Our empirical results show that our approach outperformsstate-of-the-art selective outlier ensemble techniques.
