A Survey of Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation

  Deep learning has produced state-of-the-art results for a variety of tasks.While such approaches for supervised learning have performed well, they assumethat training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution, which maynot always be the case. As a complement to this challenge, unsupervised domainadaptation can handle situations where a network is trained on labeled datafrom a source domain and unlabeled data from a related but different targetdomain with the goal of performing well at test-time on the target domain. Manyunsupervised deep domain adaptation approaches have thus been developed. Thissurvey will compare these approaches by examining alternative methods, theunique and common elements, results, and theoretical insights. We follow thiswith a look at application areas and open research directions.
