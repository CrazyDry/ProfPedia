Periodicity related to a sieve method of producing primes

  In this paper we consider a slightly different sieve method fromEratosthenes' to get primes. We find the periodicity and mirror symmetry of thepattern.

The connection between the Basel problem and a special integral

  By using Fubini theorem or Tonelli theorem, we find that the zeta functionvalue at 2 is equal to a special integral. Furthermore, We find that thisspecial integral is two times of another special integral. By using this factwe obtain the relationship between Genocchi numbers and Bernoulli numbers. Andget some results about Bernoulli polynomials.

The limit of the m-norms of a class of symmetric matrices and its  applications

  We consider a special symmetric matrix and obtain a similar formula as theone obtained by Weyl's criterion. Some applications of the formula are given,where we give a new way to calculate the integral of $\ln\Gamma(x)$ on $[0,1]$,and we claim that one class of matrices are not Hadamard matrices.

An alternative proof of the Dirichlet prime number theorem

  Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions called as Dirichlet primenumber theorem is a classical result in number theory. AtleSelberg\cite{Selberg} gave an elementary proof of this theorem. In this articlewe give an alternative proof of it based on a previous result of us. Also weget an estimation of the prime counting function in the special cases.

An equation about sum of primes with digital sum constraints

  We know that any prime number of form $4s+1$ can be written as a sum of twoperfect square numbers. As a consequence of Goldbach's weak conjecture, anynumber great than $10$ can be represented as a sum of four primes. We aremotivated to consider an equation with some constraints about digital sum forthe four primes. And we conclude that the square root of the digital sum of thefour primes will greater than $4$ and will not be a multiple of $3$ if theequation has solutions. In the proof, we give the method of determining whethera number is a perfect square.

Security Games with Information Leakage: Modeling and Computation

  Most models of Stackelberg security games assume that the attacker only knowsthe defender's mixed strategy, but is not able to observe (even partially) theinstantiated pure strategy. Such partial observation of the deployed purestrategy -- an issue we refer to as information leakage -- is a significantconcern in practical applications. While previous research on patrolling gameshas considered the attacker's real-time surveillance, our settings, thereforemodels and techniques, are fundamentally different. More specifically, afterdescribing the information leakage model, we start with an LP formulation tocompute the defender's optimal strategy in the presence of leakage. Perhapssurprisingly, we show that a key subproblem to solve this LP (more precisely,the defender oracle) is NP-hard even for the simplest of security game models.We then approach the problem from three possible directions: efficientalgorithms for restricted cases, approximation algorithms, and heuristicalgorithms for sampling that improves upon the status quo. Our experimentsconfirm the necessity of handling information leakage and the advantage of ouralgorithms.

Mitigating the Curse of Correlation in Security Games by Entropy  Maximization

  In Stackelberg security games, a defender seeks to randomly allocate limitedsecurity resources to protect critical targets from an attack. In this paper,we study a fundamental, yet underexplored, phenomenon in security games, whichwe term the \emph{Curse of Correlation} (CoC). Specifically, we observe thatthere are inevitable correlations among the protection status of differenttargets. Such correlation is a crucial concern, especially in\emph{spatio-temporal} domains like conservation area patrolling, whereattackers can surveil patrollers at certain areas and then infer theirpatrolling routes using such correlations. To mitigate this issue, we proposeto design entropy-maximizing defending strategies for spatio-temporal securitygames, which frequently suffer from CoC. We prove that the problem is \#P-hardin general. However, it admits efficient algorithms in well-motivated specialsettings. Our experiments show significant advantages of max-entropy algorithmsover previous algorithms. A scalable implementation of our algorithm iscurrently under pre-deployment testing for integration into FAMS software toimprove the scheduling of US federal air marshals.

Where to Go Next: A Spatio-temporal LSTM model for Next POI  Recommendation

  Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is of great value for bothlocation-based service providers and users. Recently Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) have been proved to be effective on sequential recommendation tasks.However, existing RNN solutions rarely consider the spatio-temporal intervalsbetween neighbor check-ins, which are essential for modeling user check-inbehaviors in next POI recommendation. In this paper, we propose a new variantof LSTM, named STLSTM, which implements time gates and distance gates into LSTMto capture the spatio-temporal relation between successive check-ins.Specifically, one-time gate and one distance gate are designed to controlshort-term interest update, and another time gate and distance gate aredesigned to control long-term interest update. Furthermore, to reduce thenumber of parameters and improve efficiency, we further integrate coupled inputand forget gates with our proposed model. Finally, we evaluate the proposedmodel using four real-world datasets from various location-based socialnetworks. Our experimental results show that our model significantlyoutperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for next POI recommendation.

Sperm-hybrid micromotor for drug delivery in the female reproductive  tract

  A sperm-driven micromotor is presented as cargo-delivery system for thetreatment of gynecological cancers. This particular hybrid micromotor isappealing to treat diseases in the female reproductive tract, the physiologicalenvironment that sperm cells are naturally adapted to swim in. Here, the singlesperm cell serves as an active drug carrier and as driving force, takingadvantage of its swimming capability, while a laser-printed microstructurecoated with a nanometric layer of iron is used to guide and release the spermin the desired area by an external magnet and structurally imposed mechanicalactuation, respectively. The printed tubular microstructure features four armswhich release the drug-loaded sperm cell in situ when they bend upon pushingagainst a tumor spheroid, resulting in the drug delivery, which occurs when thesperm squeezes through the cancer cells and fuses with cell membrane. Spermsalso offer higher drug encapsulation capability and carrying stability comparedto other nano and microcarriers, minimizing toxic effects and unwanted drugaccumulation. Moreover, sperms neither express pathogenic proteins norproliferate to form undesirable colonies, unlike other cells or microorganismsdo, making this bio-hybrid system a unique and biocompatible cargo deliveryplatform for various biomedical applications, especially in gynecologicalhealthcare.

Targeting and Signaling in Ad Auctions

  Modern ad auctions allow advertisers to target more specific segments of theuser population. Unfortunately, this is not always in the best interest of thead platform. In this paper, we examine the following basic question in thecontext of second-price ad auctions: how should an ad platform optimally revealinformation about the ad opportunity to the advertisers in order to maximizerevenue? We consider a model in which bidders' valuations depend on a randomstate of the ad opportunity. Different from previous work, we focus on a morepractical, and challenging, situation where the space of possible realizationsof ad opportunities is extremely large. We thus focus on developing algorithmswhose running time is independent of the number of ad opportunity realizations.  We examine the auctioneer's algorithmic question of designing the optimalsignaling scheme. When the auctioneer is restricted to send a public signal toall bidders, we focus on a well-motivated Bayesian valuation setting in whichthe auctioneer and bidders both have private information, and present two mainresults: 1. we exhibit a characterization result regarding approximatelyoptimal schemes and prove that any constant-approximate public signaling schememust use exponentially many signals; 2. we present a "simple" public signalingscheme that serves as a constant approximation under mild assumptions. We theninitiate an exploration on the power of being able to send different signalsprivately to different bidders. Here we examine a basic setting where theauctioneer knows bidders' valuations, and exhibit a polynomial-time privatescheme that extracts almost full surplus even in the worst Bayes Nashequilibrium. This illustrates the surprising power of private signaling schemesin extracting revenue.

Mountain building of solid quark stars

  One of the key differences between normal neutron and (bare) quark stars isrelevant to the fact that the former are gravitationally bound while the latterself-confined unless their masses approach the maximum mass. This differenceresults in the possibility that quark stars could be very low massive whereasneutron stars cannot. Mountains could also be build on quark stars if realisticcold quark matter is in a solid state, and an alternative estimation of themountain building is present. As spinning compact objects with non-axisymmetricmass distribution will radiate gravitational waves, the equations of states ofpulsars could be constraint by the amplitude of gravitational waves beingdependent on the heights of mountains. We then estimate the maximum mountainsand thus quadrupole moment on solid quark stars, to be consistent with that byOwen (2005) if the breaking strain is 0.1, addressing that a solid quark starwith mass < 10^{-2} Msun could be `potato-like'. We estimate the gravitationalwave amplitude of solid quark stars with realistic mountains to be order of h0~ 10^{-27}.

Algorithmic Bayesian Persuasion

  Persuasion, defined as the act of exploiting an informational advantage inorder to effect the decisions of others, is ubiquitous. Indeed, persuasivecommunication has been estimated to account for almost a third of all economicactivity in the US. This paper examines persuasion through a computationallens, focusing on what is perhaps the most basic and fundamental model in thisspace: the celebrated Bayesian persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow. Herethere are two players, a sender and a receiver. The receiver must take one of anumber of actions with a-priori unknown payoff, and the sender has access toadditional information regarding the payoffs. The sender can commit torevealing a noisy signal regarding the realization of the payoffs of variousactions, and would like to do so as to maximize her own payoff assuming aperfectly rational receiver.  We examine the sender's optimization task in three of the most natural inputmodels for this problem, and essentially pin down its computational complexityin each. When the payoff distributions of the different actions are i.i.d. andgiven explicitly, we exhibit a polynomial-time (exact) algorithm, and a"simple" $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm. Our optimal scheme for the i.i.d.setting involves an analogy to auction theory, and makes use of Border'scharacterization of the space of reduced-forms for single-item auctions. Whenaction payoffs are independent but non-identical with marginal distributionsgiven explicitly, we show that it is #P-hard to compute the optimal expectedsender utility. Finally, we consider a general (possibly correlated) jointdistribution of action payoffs presented by a black box sampling oracle, andexhibit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) with a bi-criteriaguarantee. We show that this result is the best possible in the black-box modelfor information-theoretic reasons.

The Mysteries of Security Games: Equilibrium Computation Becomes  Combinatorial Algorithm Design

  The security game is a basic model for resource allocation in adversarialenvironments. Here there are two players, a defender and an attacker. Thedefender wants to allocate her limited resources to defend critical targets andthe attacker seeks his most favorable target to attack. In the past decade,there has been a surge of research interest in analyzing and solving securitygames that are motivated by applications from various domains. This paperexamines security games from a theoretical perspective and provides a unifiedview of various security game models. In particular, each security game can becharacterized by a set system $E$ which consists of the defender's purestrategies, The defender's best response problem can be viewed as acombinatorial optimization problem over $E$. Our framework captures most of thebasic security game models in the literature, including all the deployedsystems, The set system $E$ arising from various domains encodes standardcombinatorial problems like bipartite matching, maximum coverage, min-costflow, packing problems, etc. Our main result shows that equilibrium computationin security games is essentially a combinatorial problem. In particular, weprove that, for any set system $E$, the following problems can be reduced toeach other in polynomial time: (0) combinatorial optimization over $E$, (1)computing the minimax equilibrium for zero-sum security games over $E$, (2)computing the strong Stackelberg equilibrium for security games over $E$, (3)computing the best or worst (for the defender) Nash equilibrium for securitygames over $E$. Here, by "games over $E$" we mean the class of security gameswith arbitrary payoff structures, but a fixed set $E$ of defender purestrategies. This shows that the complexity of a security game is essentiallydetermined by the set system $E$.

Algorithmic Persuasion with No Externalities

  We study the algorithmics of information structure design -- a.k.a.persuasion or signaling -- in a fundamental special case introduced by Arieliand Babichenko: multiple agents, binary actions, and no inter-agentexternalities. Unlike prior work on this model, we allow many states of nature.We assume that the principal's objective is a monotone set function, and studythe problem both in the public signal and private signal models, drawing asharp contrast between the two in terms of both efficacy and computationalcomplexity.  When private signals are allowed, our results are largely positive and quitegeneral. First, we show polynomial-time equivalence between optimal signalingand the problem of maximizing the objective function plus an additive function.This yields an efficient implementation of the optimal scheme when theobjective is supermodular or anonymous. Second, we exhibit a(1-1/e)-approximation of the optimal private signaling scheme, modulo anadditive loss of $\epsilon$, when the objective function is submodular. Thesetwo results simplify, unify, and generalize results of [Arieli and Babichenko,2016] and [Babichenko and Barman, 2016], extending them from a binary state ofnature to many states (modulo the additive loss in the latter result). Third,we consider the binary-state case with a submodular objective, and simplify andslightly strengthen the result of [Babichenko and Barman, 2016] to obtain a(1-1/e)-approximation via an explicitly constructed scheme.  When only a public signal is allowed, our results are negative. First, weshow that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal public scheme, within anyconstant factor, even when the objective is additive. Second, we show that theoptimal private scheme can outperform the optimal public scheme, in terms ofmaximizing the sender's objective, by a polynomial factor.

Metal-Silicene Interaction Studied by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy

  Ag atoms have been deposited on 3x3 silicene and R3xR3 silicene films bymolecular beam epitaxy method in ultrahigh vacuum. Using scanning tunnelingmicroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we found that Ag atoms do not form chemicalbonds with both 3x3 silicene and R3xR3 silicene films,which is due tochemically inert surface of silicene. On 3x3 silicene films, Ag atoms mostlyform into stable flat top Ag islands. In contrast, Ag atoms form nanoclustersand glide on silicene films, suggesting more inert nature. Raman spectroscopysuggests that there is more sp2 hybridization in R3xR3 than inR7xR7/3x3silicene films

In-Plane Anisotropies of Polarized Raman Response and Electrical  Conductivity in Layered Tin Selenide

  The group IV-VI compound SnSe, with an orthorhombic lattice structure, hasrecently attracted particular interest due to its unexpectedly low thermalconductivity and high power factor, showing great promise for thermoelectricapplications. SnSe displays intriguing anisotropic properties due to thepuckered low-symmetry in-plane lattice structure. Low-dimensional materialshave potential advantages in improving the efficiency of thermoelectricconversion, due to the increased power factor and decreased thermalconductivity. A complete study of the optical and electrical anisotropies ofSnSe nanostructures is a necessary prerequisite in taking advantage of thematerial properties for high performance devices. Here, we synthesize thesingle crystal SnSe nanoplates (NPs) by chemical vapor deposition. The angulardependence of the polarized Raman spectra of SnSe NPs shows anomalousanisotropic light-mater interaction. The angle-resolved charge transport of theSnSe NPs expresses a strong anisotropic conductivity behavior. These studieselucidate the anisotropic interactions which will be of use for futureultrathin SnSe in electronic, thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices.

Realization of Flat Band with Possible Nontrivial Topology in Electronic  Kagome Lattice

  The energy dispersion of fermions or bosons vanishes in momentum space ifdestructive quantum interference occurs in a frustrated Kagome lattice withonly nearest-neighbour (NN) hopping. A discrete flat band (FB) without anydispersion is consequently formed, promising emergence of fractional quantumHall states (FQHS) at high temperatures. Here, we report experimentalrealization of a FB with possible nontrivial topology in an electronic Kagomelattice on a twisted multilayer silicene. The electrons are localized in theKagome lattice due to quantum destructive interference, and thus, their kineticenergy is quenched, which gives rise to a FB peak in density of states. Arobust and pronounced one-dimensional edge state has been revealed at Kagomeedge, which resides at higher energy than the FB. Our observations of the FBand the exotic edge state in electronic Kagome lattice open up the possibilitytowards the realization of fractional Chern insulators in two-dimensionalmaterials.

Rediscovering the Galactic outer disk with LAMOST data

  From the derived stellar density profile using LAMOST giant stars, we findthat the Galactic disk does not show truncation or break, but smoothly transitto the halo from 19 kpc. The scale length of the outer disk is only$1.6\pm0.1$\,kpc, substantially smaller than previous results. This impliesthat the shapes of the inner and outer disk are different. Meanwhile, the diskflaring is not only found in older populations, but also in younger population.Moreover, the vertical oscillations of the disk are identified in a wide rangeor $R$ from 8 to 14 kpc. We also find that the velocity dispersion profile as afunction of the Galactocentric radius is flat with scale length of$26.3\pm3.2$\,kpc. We confirm that the radial velocity profile in outer disk issignificantly affected by asymmetric motion. The bar with either a slower or afaster pattern speed can induce the similar radial asymmetric motion.

ICFVR 2017: 3rd International Competition on Finger Vein Recognition

  In recent years, finger vein recognition has become an important sub-field inbiometrics and been applied to real-world applications. The development offinger vein recognition algorithms heavily depends on large-scale real-worlddata sets. In order to motivate research on finger vein recognition, wereleased the largest finger vein data set up to now and hold finger veinrecognition competitions based on our data set every year. In 2017,International Competition on Finger Vein Recognition(ICFVR) is held jointlywith IJCB 2017. 11 teams registered and 10 of them joined the final evaluation.The winner of this year dramatically improved the EER from 2.64% to 0.483%compared to the winner of last year. In this paper, we introduce the processand results of ICFVR 2017 and give insights on development of state-of-artfinger vein recognition algorithms.

Identification of dangerous error fields in stellarators using Hessian  matrix method

  Error fields are predominantly attributed to inevitable coil imperfections.Controlling error fields during coil fabrication and assembly is crucial forstellarators. Excessively tight coil tolerance increases time and cost, and, inpart, led to the cancellation of NCSX and delay of W7-X. In this paper, weimprove the recently proposed Hessian matrix method to rapidly identifydangerous coil deviations. Two of the most common figures of merit, magneticisland size and quasi-symmetry, are analytically differentiated over coilparameters. By extracting the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix, we candirectly identify sensitive coil deviations in the order of the eigenvalues.The new method is applied to the upcoming CFQS configuration. Dangerousperturbations that enlarge n/m=4/11 islands and deteriorate quasi-axisymmetryof the magnetic field are successfully determined. The results suggest eachmodular coil should have separate tolerance and some certain perturbationcombinations will produce significant error fields. By relaxing unnecessarycoil tolerance, this method will hopefully lead to substantial reduction intime and cost.

Nonlinear focal modulation microscopy

  Here we report nonlinear focal modulation microscopy (NFOMM) to achievesuper-resolution imaging. Abandoning the previous persistence on minimizing thesize of Gaussian emission pattern by directly narrowing (e.g. Minimizing thedetection pinhole in Airyscan, Zeiss) or by indirectly peeling its outerprofiles (e.g., Depleting the outer emission region in STED, stimulatedemission microscopy) in pointwise scanning scenarios, we stick to a moregeneral basis------ maximizing the system frequency shifting ability. In NFOMM,we implement a nonlinear focal modulation by applying phase modulations withhigh-intensity illumination, thereby extending the effective spatial-frequencybandwidth of the imaging system for reconstructing super-resolved images. NFOMMemploys a spatial light modulator (SLM) for assisting pattern-modulatedpointwise scanning, making the system single beam path while achieving atransverse resolution of 60 nm on imaging fluorescent nanoparticles. Whileexploring a relatively simple and flexible system, the imagingperformance ofNFOMM is comparable with STED as evidenced in imaging nuclear pore complexes,demonstrating NFOMM is a suitable observation tool for fundamental studies inbiology. Since NFOMM is implemented as an add-on module to an existing laserscanning microscope and easy to be aligned, we anticipate it will be adoptedrapidly by the biological community.

Effects of Oxygen Adsorption on the Surface State of Epitaxial Silicene  on Ag(111)

  Epitaxial silicene, which is one single layer of silicon atoms packed in ahoneycomb structure, demonstrates a strong interaction with the substrate thatdramatically affects its electronic structure. The role of electronic couplingin the chemical reactivity between the silicene and the substrate is stillunclear so far, which is of great importance for functionalization of silicenelayers. Here, we report the reconstructions and hybridized electronicstructures of epitaxial 4x4 silicene on Ag(111), which are revealed by scanningtunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Thehybridization between Si and Ag results in a metallic surface state, which cangradually decay due to oxygen adsorption. X-ray photoemission spectroscopyconfirms the decoupling of Si-Ag bonds after oxygen treatment as well as therelatively oxygen resistance of Ag(111) surface, in contrast to 4x4 silicene[with respect to Ag(111)]. First-principles calculations have confirmed theevolution of the electronic structure of silicene during oxidation. It has beenverified experimentally and theoretically that the high chemical activity of4x4 silicene is attributable to the Si pz state, while the Ag(111) substrateexhibits relatively inert chemical behavior.

A sample of galaxy pairs identified from the LAMOST spectral survey and  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

  A small fraction($<10\%$) of SDSS main sample galaxies(MGs) have not beentargeted with spectroscopy due to the the fiber collision effect. Thesegalaxies have been compiled into the input catalog of the LAMOST extra-galacticsurvey and named as the complementary galaxy sample. In this paper, weintroduce the project and the status of the spectroscopies of the complementarygalaxies in the first two years of the LAMOST spectral survey(till Sep. of2014). Moreover, we present a sample of 1,102 galaxy pairs identified from theLAMOST complementary galaxies and SDSS MGs, which are defined as that the twomembers have a projected distance smaller than 100 kpc and the recessionalvelocity difference smaller than 500 $\rm kms^{-1}$. Compared with the SDSSonly selected galaxy pairs, the LAMOST-SDSS pairs take the advantages of notbeing biased toward large separations and therefor play as a useful supplementto the statistical studies of galaxy interaction and galaxy merging.

Using Social Networks to Aid Homeless Shelters: Dynamic Influence  Maximization under Uncertainty - An Extended Version

  This paper presents HEALER, a software agent that recommends sequentialintervention plans for use by homeless shelters, who organize theseinterventions to raise awareness about HIV among homeless youth. HEALER'ssequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth)choose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread,while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous workpresents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants,they do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scaleup to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution ofintervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is anexpensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions:(i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves itusing a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-worldsizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, andupdates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALERconstructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebookapplication. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALERsolves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and iscurrently undergoing testing at a homeless shelter.

BENCHIP: Benchmarking Intelligence Processors

  The increasing attention on deep learning has tremendously spurred the designof intelligence processing hardware. The variety of emerging intelligenceprocessors requires standard benchmarks for fair comparison and systemoptimization (in both software and hardware). However, existing benchmarks areunsuitable for benchmarking intelligence processors due to their non-diversityand nonrepresentativeness. Also, the lack of a standard benchmarkingmethodology further exacerbates this problem. In this paper, we proposeBENCHIP, a benchmark suite and benchmarking methodology for intelligenceprocessors. The benchmark suite in BENCHIP consists of two sets of benchmarks:microbenchmarks and macrobenchmarks. The microbenchmarks consist ofsingle-layer networks. They are mainly designed for bottleneck analysis andsystem optimization. The macrobenchmarks contain state-of-the-art industrialnetworks, so as to offer a realistic comparison of different platforms. We alsopropose a standard benchmarking methodology built upon an industrial softwarestack and evaluation metrics that comprehensively reflect the variouscharacteristics of the evaluated intelligence processors. BENCHIP is utilizedfor evaluating various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, andaccelerators. BENCHIP will be open-sourced soon.

Two-photon driven Kerr resonator for quantum annealing with  three-dimensional circuit QED

  We propose a realizable circuit QED architecture for engineering states of asuperconducting resonator off-resonantly coupled to an ancillarysuperconducting qubit. The qubit-resonator dispersive interaction together witha microwave drive applied to the qubit gives rise to a Kerr resonator withtwo-photon driving that enables us to efficiently engineer the quantum state ofthe resonator such as generation of the Schrodinger cat states forresonator-based universal quantum computation. Moreover, the presentedarchitecture is easily scalable for solving optimization problem mapped intothe Ising spin glass model, and thus served as a platform for quantumannealing. Although various scalable architecture with superconducting qubitshave been proposed for realizing quantum annealer, the existing annealers arecurrently limited to the coherent time of the qubits. Here, based on theprotocol for realizing two-photon driven Kerr resonator in three-dimensionalcircuit QED (3D cQED), we propose a flexible and scalable hardware forimplementing quantum annealer that combines the advantage of the long coherencetimes attainable in 3D cQED and the recently proposed resonator basedLechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. In the proposed resonator based LHZannealer, each spin is encoded in the subspace formed by two coherent state of3D microwave superconducting resonator with opposite phase, and thus thefully-connected Ising model is mapped onto the network of the resonator withlocal tunable three-resonator interaction. This hardware architecture providesa promising physical platform for realizing quantum annealer with improvedcoherence.

Mapping the Milky Way with LAMOST III: Complicated spatial structure in  the outer disc

  We present {complexity} of the Galactic outer disc {by fitting the stellarvolume densities of the red giant branch stars with a two-disc componentmodel}. {The discs are confirmed to} extend to $R\sim19$\,kpc. The radialdensity profile of the discs shows {two breaks at $R\sim11$ and $\sim14$\,kpc,respectively, which} separate the radial profile into three segments withdifferent scale lengths of $2.12\pm0.26$, $1.18\pm0.08$, and $2.72$\,kpc at$R<11$, $11\leq R\leq14$, and $R>14$\,kpc, respectively. The first {break} islikely due to the sudden drop in the radial profile of the thin disc, which maybe an evidence of the radial migration. {Beyond $14$\,kpc, the thick discbecomes prominent and the transition from thin to thick disc leads to thesecond break.} This implies that the geometrically defined thick disc is more{radially} extended than the thin disc. This is also supported by the largerscale length of the thick disc than that of the thin disc. Meanwhile, {thescale height of the thicker component increases from $0.637_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$at $R=8$ to $1.284_{-0.079}^{+0.086}$\,kpc at $R=19$\,kpc, showing an intensiveflared disc}. Moreover, rich substructures are displayed in the residuals ofthe stellar density. Among them, the substructures $D14+2.0$ and $O14-1.5$ showa north-south asymmetry, which can be essentially explained by southwardshifting of the thick disc. However, no significant overdensity is found forthe Monoceros ring. Finally, the thick disc shows a ripple-like feature withunclear origin at $9<R<10.5$\,kpc.

Imitative Follower Deception in Stackelberg Games

  Uncertainty is one of the major challenges facing applications of gametheory. In the context of Stackelberg games, various approaches have beenproposed to deal with the leader's incomplete knowledge about the follower'spayoffs, typically by gathering information from the leader's interaction withthe follower. Unfortunately, these approaches rely crucially on the assumptionthat the follower will not strategically exploit this information asymmetry,i.e. the follower behaves truthfully during the interaction with respect totheir actual payoffs. As we show in this paper, the follower may have strongincentives to deceitfully imitating the behavior of a different follower typeand, in doing this, benefit significantly from subverting the leader intochoosing a highly suboptimal strategy. This raises a fundamental question: howto design a leader strategy in the presence of such strategic followers? Toanswer this question, we put forward a basic model of Stackelberg games with(imitative) follower deception and show that the leader is indeed able toreduce the loss due to follower deception with carefully designed strategies.We then provide a systematic study of the problem of computing the optimalleader strategy and draw a relatively complete picture of the complexitylandscape; essentially matching positive and negative complexity results areprovided for natural variants of the model. Our intractability results are insharp contrast to the situation with no deception, where the leader's optimalstrategy can be computed in polynomial time, and thus illustrate the intrinsicdifficulty of handling follower deception. Through simulations we alsodemonstrate empirically the benefit of considering follower deception.

Magnetic exchange induced Weyl state in a semimetal EuCd2Sb2

  Magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) bearing long-time pursuing are still veryrare. We herein identified magnetic exchange induced Weyl state in EuCd2Sb2, asemimetal in type IV magnetic space group, via performing high magnetic field(B) magneto-transport measurements and ab initio calculations. For the A-typeantiferromagnetic (AFM) structure of EuCd2Sb2, external B larger than 3.2 T canalign Eu spins to be fully polarized along the c-axis and consequently drivethe system into a ferromagnetic (FM) state. Measurements up to B ~ 55 Trevealed a striking Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation imposed by a nontrivial Berryphase. We unveiled a phase transition from a small-gap AFM topologicalinsulator into a FM WSM in which Weyl points emerged along the {\Gamma}-Z path.Fermi arcs on (100) and (010) surfaces are also revealed. The results pave away towards realization of various topological states in a single materialthrough magnetic exchange manipulation.

Precision Higgs Physics at CEPC

  The discovery of the Higgs boson with its mass around 125 GeV by the ATLASand CMS Collaborations marked the beginning of a new era in high energyphysics. The Higgs boson will be the subject of extensive studies of theongoing LHC program. At the same time, lepton collider based Higgs factorieshave been proposed as a possible next step beyond the LHC, with its main goalto precisely measure the properties of the Higgs boson and probe potential newphysics associated with the Higgs boson. The Circular Electron PositronCollider~(CEPC) is one of such proposed Higgs factories. The CEPC is an$e^+e^-$ circular collider proposed by and to be hosted in China. Located in atunnel of approximately 100~km in circumference, it will operate at acenter-of-mass energy of 240~GeV as the Higgs factory. In this paper, wepresent the first estimates on the precision of the Higgs boson propertymeasurements achievable at the CEPC and discuss implications of thesemeasurements.
