Experimental Comparison of Representation Methods and Distance Measures  for Time Series Data

  The previous decade has brought a remarkable increase of the interest inapplications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Many ofthe research efforts in this context have focused on introducing newrepresentation methods for dimensionality reduction or novel similaritymeasures for the underlying data. In the vast majority of cases, eachindividual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and,aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitativeexperimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspectsof these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits ofthe proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order toprovide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive experimentalstudy re-implementing eight different time series representations and ninesimilarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness onthirty-eight time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains.In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and presentour comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Inaddition to providing a unified validation of some of the existingachievements, our experiments also indicate that, in some cases, certain claimsin the literature may be unduly optimistic.
