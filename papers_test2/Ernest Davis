Winograd Schemas and Machine Translation

  A Winograd schema is a pair of sentences that differ in a single word andthat contain an ambiguous pronoun whose referent is different in the twosentences and requires the use of commonsense knowledge or world knowledge todisambiguate. This paper discusses how Winograd schemas and other sentencepairs could be used as challenges for machine translation using distinctionsbetween pronouns, such as gender, that appear in the target language but not inthe source.

The Relevance of Proofs of the Rationality of Probability Theory to  Automated Reasoning and Cognitive Models

  A number of well-known theorems, such as Cox's theorem and de Finetti'stheorem. prove that any model of reasoning with uncertain information thatsatisfies specified conditions of "rationality" must satisfy the axioms ofprobability theory. I argue here that these theorems do not in themselvesdemonstrate that probabilistic models are in fact suitable for any specifictask in automated reasoning or plausible for cognitive models. First, thetheorems only establish that there exists some probabilistic model; they do notestablish that there exists a useful probabilistic model, i.e. one with atractably small number of numerical parameters and a large number ofindependence assumptions. Second, there are in general many differentprobabilistic models for a given situation, many of which may be far moreirrational, in the usual sense of the term, than a model that violates theaxioms of probability theory. I illustrate this second point with an extendedexamples of two tasks of induction, of a similar structure, where thereasonable probabilistic models are very different.

The Scope and Limits of Simulation in Cognitive Models

  It has been proposed that human physical reasoning consists largely ofrunning "physics engines in the head" in which the future trajectory of thephysical system under consideration is computed precisely using accuratescientific theories. In such models, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge isdealt with by sampling probabilistically over the space of possibletrajectories ("Monte Carlo simulation"). We argue that such simulation-basedmodels are too weak, in that there are many important aspects of human physicalreasoning that cannot be carried out this way, or can only be carried out veryinefficiently; and too strong, in that humans make large systematic errors thatthe models cannot account for. We conclude that simulation-based reasoningmakes up at most a small part of a larger system that encompasses a wide rangeof additional cognitive processes.

The Limitations of Standardized Science Tests as Benchmarks for  Artificial Intelligence Research: Position Paper

  In this position paper, I argue that standardized tests for elementaryscience such as SAT or Regents tests are not very good benchmarks for measuringthe progress of artificial intelligence systems in understanding basic science.The primary problem is that these tests are designed to test aspects ofknowledge and ability that are challenging for people; the aspects that arechallenging for AI systems are very different. In particular, standardizedtests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledgecan be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specificfeatures that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark. I analyzethe Physics subject SAT in some detail and the New York State Regents Sciencetest more briefly. I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by usingstandardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory. The one major realadvantage is that the significance is easily explained to the public; but Iargue that even this is a somewhat mixed blessing. I conclude by arguing that,first, more appropriate collections of exam style problems could be assembled,and second, that there are better kinds of benchmarks than exam-style problems.In an appendix I present a collection of sample exam-style problems that testkinds of knowledge missing from the standardized tests.

Commonsense Reasoning, Commonsense Knowledge, and The SP Theory of  Intelligence

  This paper describes how the "SP Theory of Intelligence" with the "SPComputer Model", outlined in an Appendix, may throw light on aspects ofcommonsense reasoning (CSR) and commonsense knowledge (CSK), as discussed inanother paper by Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus (DM). In four main sections, thepaper describes: 1) The main problems to be solved; 2) Other research on CSRand CSK; 3) Why the SP system may prove useful with CSR and CSK 4) How examplesdescribed by DM may be modelled in the SP system. With regard to successes inthe automation of CSR described by DM, the SP system's strengths insimplification and integration may promote seamless integration across theseareas, and seamless integration of those area with other aspects ofintelligence. In considering challenges in the automation of CSR described byDM, the paper describes in detail, with examples of SP-multiple-alignments. howthe SP system may model processes of interpretation and reasoning arising fromthe horse's head scene in "The Godfather" film. A solution is presented to the'long tail' problem described by DM. The SP system has some potentially usefulthings to say about several of DM's objectives for research in CSR and CSK.

Asynchronous Decentralized Algorithm for Space-Time Cooperative  Pathfinding

  Cooperative pathfinding is a multi-agent path planning problem where a groupof vehicles searches for a corresponding set of non-conflicting space-timetrajectories. Many of the practical methods for centralized solving ofcooperative pathfinding problems are based on the prioritized planningstrategy. However, in some domains (e.g., multi-robot teams of unmanned aerialvehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, or unmanned ground vehicles) adecentralized approach may be more desirable than a centralized one due tocommunication limitations imposed by the domain and/or privacy concerns.  In this paper we present an asynchronous decentralized variant of prioritizedplanning ADPP and its interruptible version IADPP. The algorithm exploits theinherent parallelism of distributed systems and allows for a speed up of thecomputation process. Unlike the synchronized planning approaches, the algorithmallows an agent to react to updates about other agents' paths immediately andinvoke its local spatio-temporal path planner to find the best trajectory, asresponse to the other agents' choices. We provide a proof of correctness of thealgorithms and experimentally evaluate them on synthetic domains.
