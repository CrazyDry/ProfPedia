Microstructural Materials Design via Deep Adversarial Learning  Methodology

  Identifying the key microstructure representations is crucial forComputational Materials Design (CMD). However, existing microstructurecharacterization and reconstruction (MCR) techniques have limitations to beapplied for materials design. Model-based MCR approaches do not have parametersthat can serve as design variables, while MCR techniques that rely on dimensionreduction tend to lose important microstructural information. In this work, wepresent a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitationsof existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarialnetworks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables andmicrostructures. Thereafter, the low-dimensional latent variables serve asdesign variables, and a Bayesian optimization framework is applied to obtainmicrostructures with desired material property. Due to the special design ofthe network architecture, the proposed methodology is able to identify thelatent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize theinformation loss even for complex material microstructures. The validity of theproposed methodology is tested numerically on a synthetic microstructuredataset and its effectiveness for materials design is evaluated through a casestudy of optimizing optical performance for energy absorption. In addition, thescalability and transferability of proposed methodology are also demonstratedin this work. Specifically, the proposed methodology is scalable to generatearbitrary sized microstructures, and it can serve as a pre-trained model toimprove the performance of a structure-property predictive model via transferlearning.

A Parallel Monte Carlo Code for Simulating Collisional N-body Systems

  We present a new parallel code for computing the dynamical evolution ofcollisional N-body systems with up to N~10^7 particles. Our code is based onthe the Henon Monte Carlo method for solving the Fokker-Planck equation, andmakes assumptions of spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium. Theprincipal algorithmic developments involve optimizing data structures, and theintroduction of a parallel random number generation scheme, as well as aparallel sorting algorithm, required to find nearest neighbors for interactionsand to compute the gravitational potential. The new algorithms we introducealong with our choice of decomposition scheme minimize communication costs andensure optimal distribution of data and workload among the processing units.The implementation uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library forcommunication, which makes it portable to many different supercomputingarchitectures. We validate the code by calculating the evolution of clusterswith initial Plummer distribution functions up to core collapse with the numberof stars, N, spanning three orders of magnitude, from 10^5 to 10^7. We findthat our results are in good agreement with self-similar core-collapsesolutions, and the core collapse times generally agree with expectations fromthe literature. Also, we observe good total energy conservation, within lessthan 0.04% throughout all simulations. We analyze the performance of the code,and demonstrate near-linear scaling of the runtime with the number ofprocessors up to 64 processors for N=10^5, 128 for N=10^6 and 256 for N=10^7.The runtime reaches a saturation with the addition of more processors beyondthese limits which is a characteristic of the parallel sorting algorithm. Theresulting maximum speedups we achieve are approximately 60x, 100x, and 220x,respectively.
