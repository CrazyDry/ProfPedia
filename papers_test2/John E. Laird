Relational Reinforcement Learning in Infinite Mario

  Relational representations in reinforcement learning allow for the use ofstructural information like the presence of objects and relationships betweenthem in the description of value functions. Through this paper, we show thatsuch representations allow for the inclusion of background knowledge thatqualitatively describes a state and can be used to design agents thatdemonstrate learning behavior in domains with large state and actions spacessuch as computer games.

Hunting for the progenitor of SN 1006: High resolution spectroscopic  search with the FLAMES instrument

  Type Ia supernovae play a significant role in the evolution of the Universeand have a wide range of applications. It is widely believed that these eventsare the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs close to theChandrasekhar mass (1.38 M\odot). However, CO white dwarfs are born with massesmuch below the Chandrasekhar limit and thus require mass accretion to becomeType Ia supernovae. There are two main scenarios for accretion. First, themerger of two white dwarfs and, second, a stable mass accretion from acompanion star. According to predictions, this companion star (also referred toas donor star) survives the explosion and thus should be visible in the centerof Type Ia remnants. In this paper we scrutinize the central stars (79 intotal) of the SN 1006 remnant to search for the surviving donor star aspredicted by this scenario. We find no star consistent with the traditionalaccretion scenario in SN1006.

MagAO Imaging of Long-period Objects (MILO). II. A Puzzling White Dwarf  around the Sun-like Star HD 11112

  HD 11112 is an old, Sun-like star that has a long-term radial velocity (RV)trend indicative of a massive companion on a wide orbit. Here we present directimages of the source responsible for the trend using the Magellan AdaptiveOptics system. We detect the object (HD 11112B) at a separation of 2\fasec 2(100 AU) at multiple wavelengths spanning 0.6-4 \microns ~and show that it ismost likely a gravitationally-bound cool white dwarf. Modeling its spectralenergy distribution (SED) suggests that its mass is 0.9-1.1 \msun, whichcorresponds to very high-eccentricity, near edge-on orbits from Markov chainMonte Carlo analysis of the RV and imaging data together. The total age of thewhite dwarf is $>2\sigma$ discrepant with that of the primary star under mostassumptions. The problem can be resolved if the white dwarf progenitor wasinitially a double white dwarf binary that then merged into the observedhigh-mass white dwarf. HD 11112B is a unique and intriguing benchmark objectthat can be used to calibrate atmospheric and evolutionary models of cool whitedwarfs and should thus continue to be monitored by RV and direct imaging overthe coming years.

The Gray Needle: Large Grains in the HD 15115 Debris Disk from  LBT/PISCES/Ks and LBTI/LMIRcam/L' Adaptive Optics Imaging

  We present diffraction-limited \ks band and \lprime adaptive optics images ofthe edge-on debris disk around the nearby F2 star HD 15115, obtained with asingle 8.4 m primary mirror at the Large Binocular Telescope. At \ks band thedisk is detected at signal-to-noise per resolution element (SNRE) \about 3-8from \about 1-2\fasec 5 (45-113 AU) on the western side, and from \about1.2-2\fasec 1 (63-90 AU) on the east. At \lprime the disk is detected at SNRE\about 2.5 from \about 1-1\fasec 45 (45-90 AU) on both sides, implying moresymmetric disk structure at 3.8 \microns . At both wavelengths the disk has abow-like shape and is offset from the star to the north by a few AU. A surfacebrightness asymmetry exists between the two sides of the disk at \ks band, butnot at \lprime . The surface brightness at \ks band declines inside 1\asec(\about 45 AU), which may be indicative of a gap in the disk near 1\asec. The\ks - \lprime disk color, after removal of the stellar color, is mostly greyfor both sides of the disk. This suggests that scattered light is coming fromlarge dust grains, with 3-10 \microns -sized grains on the east side and 1-10\microns dust grains on the west. This may suggest that the west side iscomposed of smaller dust grains than the east side, which would support theinterpretation that the disk is being dynamically affected by interactions withthe local interstellar medium.

Mapping H-band Scattered Light Emission in the Mysterious SR21  Transitional Disk

  We present the first near infrared (NIR) spatially resolved images of thecircumstellar transitional disk around SR21. These images were obtained withthe Subaru HiCIAO camera, adaptive optics and the polarized differentialimaging (PDI) technique. We resolve the disk in scattered light at H-band forstellocentric 0.1"<r<0.6" (12<r<75AU). We compare our results with previouslypublished spatially-resolved 880 micron continuum Submillimeter Array (SMA)images that show an inner r<36AU cavity in SR21. Radiative transfer modelsreveal that the large disk depletion factor invoked to explain SR21's sub-mmcavity cannot be "universal" for all grain sizes. Even significantly moremoderate depletions (delta=0.1, 0.01 relative to an undepleted disk) than thosethat reproduce the sub-mm cavity (delta~10^-6) are inconsistent with our H-bandimages when they are assumed to carry over to small grains, suggesting thatsurface grains scattering in the NIR either survive or are generated bywhatever mechanism is clearing the disk midplane. In fact, the radial polarizedintensity profile of our H-band observations is smooth and steeplyinwardly-increasing (r^-3), with no evidence of a break at the 36AU sub-mmcavity wall. We hypothesize that this profile is dominated by an optically thindisk envelope or atmosphere component. We also discuss the compatibility of ourdata with the previously postulated existence of a sub-stellar companion toSR21 at r~10-20AU, and find that we can neither exclude nor verify thisscenario. This study demonstrates the power of multiwavelength imaging oftransitional disks to inform modeling efforts, including the debate overprecisely what physical mechanism is responsible for clearing these disks oftheir large midplane grains.

SEEDS Adaptive Optics Imaging of the Asymmetric Transition Disk Oph IRS  48 in Scattered Light

  We present the first resolved near infrared imagery of the transition diskOph IRS 48 (WLY 2-48), which was recently observed with ALMA to have a stronglyasymmetric sub-millimeter flux distribution. H-band polarized intensity imagesshow a $\sim$60AU radius scattered light cavity with two pronounced arcs ofemission, one from Northeast to Southeast and one smaller, fainter and moredistant arc in the Northwest. K-band scattered light imagery reveals a similarmorphology, but with a clear third arc along the Southwestern rim of the diskcavity. This arc meets the Northwestern arc at nearly a right angle, revealingthe presence of a spiral arm or local surface brightness deficit in the disk,and explaining the East-West brightness asymmetry in the H-band data. We alsopresent 0.8-5.4$\mu$m IRTF SpeX spectra of this object, which allow us toconstrain the spectral class to A0$\pm$1 and measure a low mass accretion rateof 10$^{-8.5}$M$_{\odot}$/yr, both consistent with previous estimates. Weinvestigate a variety of reddening laws in order to fit the mutliwavelength SEDof Oph IRS 48 and find a best fit consistent with a younger, higher luminositystar than previous estimates.

Observation of the rare $B^0_s\toμ^+μ^-$ decay from the combined  analysis of CMS and LHCb data

  A joint measurement is presented of the branching fractions$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ in proton-proton collisions at theLHC by the CMS and LHCb experiments. The data samples were collected in 2011 ata centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and in 2012 at 8 TeV. The combined analysisproduces the first observation of the $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, with astatistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the bestmeasurement of its branching fraction so far. Furthermore, evidence for the$B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay is obtained with a statistical significance of threestandard deviations. The branching fraction measurements are statisticallycompatible with SM predictions and impose stringent constraints on severaltheories beyond the SM.
