Practical free-space quantum key distribution over 10 km in daylight and  at night

  We have demonstrated quantum key distribution (QKD) over a 10-km, 1-airmassatmospheric range during daylight and at night. Secret random bit sequences ofthe quality required for the cryptographic keys used to initialize securecommunications devices were transferred at practical rates with realisticsecurity. By identifying the physical parameters that determine the system'ssecrecy efficiency, we infer that free-space QKD will be practical over muchlonger ranges under these and other atmospheric and instrumental conditions.

Observation of the n(3He,t)p Reaction by Detection of Far-Ultraviolet  Radiation

  We have detected Lyman alpha radiation as a product of the n(3He,t)p nuclearreaction occurring in a cell of 3He gas. The predominant source of thisradiation appears to be decay of the 2p state of tritium produced by chargetransfer and excitation collisions with the background 3He gas. Under theexperimental conditions reported here we find yields of tens of Lyman alphaphotons for every neutron reaction. These results suggest a method of coldneutron detection that is complementary to existing technologies that useproportional counters. In particular, this approach may provide single neutronsensitivity with wide dynamic range capability, and a class of neutrondetectors that are compact and operate at relatively low voltages.

Far-ultraviolet signatures of the 3He(n,tp) reaction in noble gas  mixtures

  Previous work showed that the 3He(n,tp) reaction in a cell of 3He atatmospheric pressure generated tens of far-ultraviolet photons per reactedneutron. Here we report amplification of that signal by factors of 1000 andmore when noble gases are added to the cell. Calibrated filter-detectormeasurements show that this large signal is due to noble-gas excimer emissions,and that the nuclear reaction energy is converted to far-ultraviolet radiationwith efficiencies of up to 30%. The results have been placed on an absolutescale through calibrations at the NIST SURF III synchrotron. They suggestpossibilities for high-efficiency neutron detectors as an alternative toexisting proportional counters.

Quantum key distribution at telecom wavelengths with noise-free  detectors

  The length of a secure link over which a quantum key can be distributeddepends on the efficiency and dark-count rate of the detectors used at thereceiver. We report on the first demonstration of quantum key distributionusing transition-edge sensors with high efficiency and negligible dark-countrates. Using two methods of synchronization, a bright optical pulse scheme andan electrical signal scheme, we have successfully distributed key material at1,550 nm over 50 km of optical fiber. We discuss how use of these detectors ina quantum key distribution system can result in dramatic increases in range andperformance.

Long distance decoy state quantum key distribution in optical fiber

  The theoretical existence of photon-number-splitting attacks creates asecurity loophole for most quantum key distribution (QKD) demonstrations thatuse a highly attenuated laser source. Using ultra-low-noise, high-efficiencytransition-edge sensor photodetectors, we have implemented the first version ofa decoy-state protocol that incorporates finite statistics without the use ofGaussian approximations in a one-way QKD system, enabling the creation ofsecure keys immune to photon-number-splitting attacks and highly resistant toTrojan horse attacks over 107 km of optical fiber.

High-resolution, vacuum-ultraviolet absorption spectrum of boron  trifluoride

  In the course of investigations of thermal neutron detection based onmixtures of $^{10}$BF$_3$ with other gases, knowledge was required of thephotoabsorption cross sections of $^{10}$BF$_3$ for wavelengths between 135 and205 nm. Large discrepancies in the values reported in existing literature ledto the absolute measurements reported in this communication. The measurementswere made at the SURF III synchrotron radiation facility at the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology. The measured absorption cross sectionsvary from 10$^{-20}$ cm$^2$ at 135 nm to less than 10$^{-21}$ cm$^2$ in theregion from 165 to 205 nm. Three previously unreported absorption features withresolvable structure were found in the regions 135 to 145 nm, 150 to 165 nm and190 to 205 nm. Quantum mechanical calculations, using the TD-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZvariant of time-dependent density functional theory implemented in Gaussian 09,suggest that the observed absorption features arise from symmetry-changingadiabatic transitions.

Misalignment of Magnetic Fields and Outflows in Protostellar Cores

  We present results of 1.3 mm dust polarization observations toward 16 nearby,low-mass protostars, mapped with ~2.5" resolution at CARMA. The results showthat magnetic fields in protostellar cores on scales of ~1000 AU are nottightly aligned with outflows from the protostars. Rather, the data areconsistent with scenarios where outflows and magnetic fields are preferentiallymisaligned (perpendicular), or where they are randomly aligned. If one assumesthat outflows emerge along the rotation axes of circumstellar disks, and thatthe outflows have not disrupted the fields in the surrounding material, thenour results imply that the disks are not aligned with the fields in the coresfrom which they formed.

Network-Centric Quantum Communications with Application to Critical  Infrastructure Protection

  Network-centric quantum communications (NQC) - a new, scalable instantiationof quantum cryptography providing key management with forward security forlightweight encryption, authentication and digital signatures in opticalnetworks - is briefly described. Results from a multi-node experimentaltest-bed utilizing integrated photonics quantum communications components,known as QKarDs, include: quantum identification; verifiable quantum secretsharing; multi-party authenticated key establishment, including group keying;and single-fiber quantum-secured communications that can be applied as asecurity retrofit/upgrade to existing optical fiber installations. Ademonstration that NQC meets the challenging simultaneous latency and securityrequirements of electric grid control communications, which cannot be metwithout compromises using conventional cryptography, is described.

Hand2Face: Automatic Synthesis and Recognition of Hand Over Face  Occlusions

  A person's face discloses important information about their affective state.Although there has been extensive research on recognition of facialexpressions, the performance of existing approaches is challenged by facialocclusions. Facial occlusions are often treated as noise and discarded inrecognition of affective states. However, hand over face occlusions can provideadditional information for recognition of some affective states such ascuriosity, frustration and boredom. One of the reasons that this problem hasnot gained attention is the lack of naturalistic occluded faces that containhand over face occlusions as well as other types of occlusions. Traditionalapproaches for obtaining affective data are time demanding and expensive, whichlimits researchers in affective computing to work on small datasets. Thislimitation affects the generalizability of models and deprives researchers fromtaking advantage of recent advances in deep learning that have shown greatsuccess in many fields but require large volumes of data. In this paper, wefirst introduce a novel framework for synthesizing naturalistic facialocclusions from an initial dataset of non-occluded faces and separate images ofhands, reducing the costly process of data collection and annotation. We thenpropose a model for facial occlusion type recognition to differentiate betweenhand over face occlusions and other types of occlusions such as scarves, hair,glasses and objects. Finally, we present a model to localize hand over faceocclusions and identify the occluded regions of the face.

The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale XII. The  Discovery of Cepheids and a New Distance to NGC 2541

  We report the detection of Cepheids and a new distance to the spiral galaxyNGC 2541, based on data obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A total of 25 exposures (divided into13 epochs) are obtained using the F555W filter (transformed to Johnson V), andnine exposures (divided into five epochs) using the F814W filter (transformedto Cousins I). Photometric reduction of the data is performed using twoindependent packages, DoPHOT and DAOPHOT II/ALLFRAME, which give very goodagreement in the measured magnitudes. A total of 34 bona fide Cepheids, withperiods ranging from 12 to over 60 days, are identified based on both sets ofphotometry. By fitting V and I period-luminosity relations, apparent distancemoduli are derived assuming a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and meancolor excess of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E(B-V) = 0.10 mag respectively. AdoptingA(V)/E(V-I)=2.45, we obtain a true distance modulus to NGC 2541 of 30.47 +/-0.11 (random) +/- 0.12 (systematic) mag (D = 12.4 +/- 0.6 (random) +/- 0.7(systematic) Mpc), and a total (Galactic plus internal) mean color excessE(B-V) = 0.08 +/- 0.05 (internal error) mag.

The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale XVII. The  Cepheid Distance to NGC 4725

  The distance to NGC 4725 has been derived from Cepheid variables, as part ofthe Hubble Space Telescope Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale.Thirteen F555W (V) and four F814W (I) epochs of cosmic-ray-split Wide Field andPlanetary Camera 2 observations were obtained. Twenty Cepheids were discovered,with periods ranging from 12 to 49 days. Adopting a Large Magellanic Clouddistance modulus and extinction of 18.50+/-0.10 mag and E(V-I)=0.13 mag,respectively, a true reddening-corrected distance modulus (based on an analysisemploying the ALLFRAME software package) of 30.50 +/- 0.16 (random) +/- 0.17(systematic) mag was determined for NGC 4725. The corresponding of distance of12.6 +/- 1.0 (random) +/- 1.0 (systematic) Mpc is in excellent agreement withthat found with an independent analysis based upon the DoPHOT photometrypackage. With a foreground reddening of only E(V-I)=0.02, the inferredintrinsic reddening of this field in NGC 4725, E(V-I)=0.19, makes it one of themost highly-reddened, encountered by the HST Key Project, to date.

High-spin structure in $^{40}$K

  High-spin states of $^{40}$K have been populated in the fusion-evaporationreaction $^{12}$C($^{30}$Si,np)$^{40}$K and studied by means of $\gamma$-rayspectroscopy techniques using one AGATA triple cluster detector, at INFN -Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro. Several new states with excitation energy upto 8 MeV and spin up to $10^-$ have been discovered. These new states arediscussed in terms of J=3 and T=0 neutron-proton hole pairs. Shell-modelcalculations in a large model space have shown a good agreement with theexperimental data for most of the energy levels. The evolution of the structureof this nucleus is here studied as a function of excitation energy and angularmomentum.

The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale. XXII. The  Discovery of Cepheids in NGC 1326-A

  We report on the detection of Cepheids and the first distance measurement tothe spiral galaxy NGC 1326-A, a member of the Fornax cluster of galaxies. Wehave employed data obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on boardthe Hubble Space Telescope. Over a 49 day interval, a total of twelve V-band(F555W) and eight I-band (F814W) epochs of observation were obtained. Twophotometric reduction packages, ALLFRAME and DoPHOT, have been employed toobtain photometry measures from the three Wide Field CCDs. Variability analysisyields a total of 17 Cepheids in common with both photometry datasets, withperiods ranging between 10 and 50 days. Of these 14 Cepheids with high-qualitylightcurves are used to fit the V and I period-luminosity relations and deriveapparent distance moduli, assuming a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus(m-M) (LMC) = 18.50 +- 0.10 mag and color excess E(B-V) = 0.10 mag. AssumingA(V)/E(V-I) = 2.45, the DoPHOT data yield a true distance modulus to NGC 1326-Aof (m-M)_0 = 31.36 +- 0.17 (random) +- 0.13 (systematic) mag, corresponding toa distance of 18.7 \pm 1.5 (random) \pm 1.2 (systematic) Mpc. The deriveddistance to NGC 1326-A is in good agreement with the distance derivedpreviously to NGC 1365, another spiral galaxy member of the Fornax cluster.However the distances to both galaxies are significantly lower than to NGC1425, a third Cepheid calibrator in the outer parts of the cluster.

The First Focused Hard X-ray Images of the Sun with NuSTAR

  We present results from the the first campaign of dedicated solarobservations undertaken by the \textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray}({\em NuSTAR}) hard X-ray telescope. Designed as an astrophysics mission, {\emNuSTAR} nonetheless has the capability of directly imaging the Sun at hardX-ray energies ($>$3~keV) with an increase in sensitivity of at least twomagnitude compared to current non-focusing telescopes. In this paper wedescribe the scientific areas where \textit{NuSTAR} will make majorimprovements on existing solar measurements. We report on the techniques usedto observe the Sun with \textit{NuSTAR}, their limitations and complications,and the procedures developed to optimize solar data quality derived from ourexperience with the initial solar observations. These first observations arebriefly described, including the measurement of the Fe K-shell lines in adecaying X-class flare, hard X-ray emission from high in the solar corona, andfull-disk hard X-ray images of the Sun.

Evidence of Significant Energy Input in the Late Phase of a Solar Flare  from NuSTAR X-Ray Observations

  We present observations of the occulted active region AR12222 during thethird {\em NuSTAR} solar campaign on 2014 December 11, with concurrent {\emSDO/}AIA and {\em FOXSI-2} sounding rocket observations. The active regionproduced a medium size solar flare one day before the observations, at$\sim18$UT on 2014 December 10, with the post-flare loops still visible at thetime of {\em NuSTAR} observations. The time evolution of the source emission inthe {\em SDO/}AIA $335\textrm{\AA}$ channel reveals the characteristics of anextreme-ultraviolet late phase event, caused by the continuous formation of newpost-flare loops that arch higher and higher in the solar corona. The spectralfitting of {\em NuSTAR} observations yields an isothermal source, withtemperature $3.8-4.6$ MK, emission measure $0.3-1.8 \times 10^{46}\textrm{cm}^{-3}$, and density estimated at $2.5-6.0 \times 10^8 \textrm{ cm}^{-3}$.The observed AIA fluxes are consistent with the derived {\em NuSTAR}temperature range, favoring temperature values in the range $4.0-4.3$ MK. Byexamining the post-flare loops' cooling times and energy content, we estimatethat at least 12 sets of post-flare loops were formed and subsequently cooledbetween the onset of the flare and {\em NuSTAR} observations, with their totalthermal energy content an order of magnitude larger than the energy content atflare peak time. This indicates that the standard approach of using only theflare peak time to derive the total thermal energy content of a flare can leadto a large underestimation of its value.

First NuSTAR Limits on Quiet Sun Hard X-Ray Transient Events

  We present the first results of a search for transient hard X-ray (HXR)emission in the quiet solar corona with the \textit{Nuclear SpectroscopicTelescope Array} (\textit{NuSTAR}) satellite. While \textit{NuSTAR} wasdesigned as an astrophysics mission, it can observe the Sun above 2~keV withunprecedented sensitivity due to its pioneering use of focusing optics.\textit{NuSTAR} first observed quiet Sun regions on 2014 November 1, althoughout-of-view active regions contributed a notable amount of background in theform of single-bounce (unfocused) X-rays. We conducted a search for quiet Suntransient brightenings on time scales of 100 s and set upper limits on emissionin two energy bands. We set 2.5--4~keV limits on brightenings with time scalesof 100 s, expressed as the temperature T and emission measure EM of a thermalplasma. We also set 10--20~keV limits on brightenings with time scales of 30,60, and 100 s, expressed as model-independent photon fluxes. The limits in bothbands are well below previous HXR microflare detections, though not low enoughto detect events of equivalent T and EM as quiet Sun brightenings seen in softX-ray observations. We expect future observations during solar minimum toincrease the \textit{NuSTAR} sensitivity by over two orders of magnitude due tohigher instrument livetime and reduced solar background.

Fermi LAT Search for Dark Matter in Gamma-ray Lines and the Inclusive  Photon Spectrum

  Dark matter particle annihilation or decay can produce monochromaticgamma-ray lines and contribute to the diffuse gamma-ray background. Flux upperlimits are presented for gamma-ray spectral lines from 7 to 200 GeV and for thediffuse gamma-ray background from 4.8 GeV to 264 GeV obtained from two years ofFermi Large Area Telescope data integrated over most of the sky. We give crosssection upper limits and decay lifetime lower limits for dark matter modelsthat produce gamma-ray lines or contribute to the diffuse spectrum, includingmodels proposed as explanations of the PAMELA and Fermi cosmic-ray data.

TADPOL: A 1.3 mm Survey of Dust Polarization in Star-forming Cores and  Regions

  We present {\lambda}1.3 mm CARMA observations of dust polarization toward 30star-forming cores and 8 star-forming regions from the TADPOL survey. We showmaps of all sources, and compare the ~2.5" resolution TADPOL maps with ~20"resolution polarization maps from single-dish submillimeter telescopes. Here wedo not attempt to interpret the detailed B-field morphology of each object.Rather, we use average B-field orientations to derive conclusions in astatistical sense from the ensemble of sources, bearing in mind that theseaverage orientations can be quite uncertain. We discuss three main findings:(1) A subset of the sources have consistent magnetic field (B-field)orientations between large (~20") and small (~2.5") scales. Those same sourcesalso tend to have higher fractional polarizations than the sources withinconsistent large-to-small-scale fields. We interpret this to mean that in atleast some cases B-fields play a role in regulating the infall of material allthe way down to the ~1000 AU scales of protostellar envelopes. (2) Outflowsappear to be randomly aligned with B-fields; although, in sources with lowpolarization fractions there is a hint that outflows are preferentiallyperpendicular to small-scale B-fields, which suggests that in these sources thefields have been wrapped up by envelope rotation. (3) Finally, even at ~2.5"resolution we see the so-called "polarization hole" effect, where thefractional polarization drops significantly near the total intensity peak. Alldata are publicly available in the electronic edition of this article.

Gamma-Ray and Parsec-Scale Jet Properties of a Complete Sample of  Blazars From the MOJAVE Program

  We investigate the Fermi LAT gamma-ray and 15 GHz VLBA radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of AGNs obtained during the first 11months of the Fermi mission (2008 Aug 4 - 2009 Jul 5). Our sample contains thebrightest 173 AGNs in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. The latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (SED) parameters in the bright blazar population.The BL Lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron SED peak frequency, suggesting a universalSED shape for objects of this class. The synchrotron self-Compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these BL Lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of Compton dominance on Dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron SED peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. The high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) BL Lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. No equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQ) in our sample. Given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the HSP BL Lacs have generally lowerDoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked BL Lacs or FSRQs in oursample.

Detection of the Characteristic Pion-Decay Signature in Supernova  Remnants

  Cosmic rays are particles (mostly protons) accelerated to relativisticspeeds. Despite wide agreement that supernova remnants (SNRs) are the sourcesof galactic cosmic rays, unequivocal evidence for the acceleration of protonsin these objects is still lacking. When accelerated protons encounterinterstellar material, they produce neutral pions, which in turn decay intogamma rays. This offers a compelling way to detect the acceleration sites ofprotons. The identification of pion-decay gamma rays has been difficult becausehigh-energy electrons also produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung and inverseCompton scattering. We detected the characteristic pion-decay feature in thegamma-ray spectra of two SNRs, IC 443 and W44, with the Fermi Large AreaTelescope. This detection provides direct evidence that cosmic-ray protons areaccelerated in SNRs.

Constraints on the Galactic Population of TEV Pulsar Wind Nebulae Using  Fermi Large Area Telescope Observations

  Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) have been established as the most populous classof TeV gamma-ray emitters. Since launch, the Fermi Large Area Telescope(LAT)identified five high-energy (100MeV <E< 100 GeV) gamma-ray sources asPWNe, and detected a large number of PWNe candidates, all powered by young andenergetic pulsars. The wealth of multi-wavelength data available and the newresults provided by Fermi-LAT give us an opportunity to find new PWNe and toexplore the radiative processes taking place in known ones. The TeV gamma-rayunidentifiedsources (UNIDs) are the best candidates for finding new PWNe. Using45 months of Fermi-LAT data for energies above 10 GeV, an analysis wasperformed near the position of 58TeV PWNe and UNIDs within 5deg of the GalacticPlane to establish new constraints on PWNe properties and find new clues on thenature of UNIDs. Of the 58 sources, 30 were detected, and this work providestheir gamma-rayfluxes for energies above 10 GeV. The spectral energydistributions (SED) andupper limits, in the multi-wavelength context, alsoprovide new information on the source nature and can help distinguish betweenemission scenarios, i.e. between classification as a pulsar candidate or as aPWN candidate. Six new GeV PWNe candidates are described in detail and comparedwith existing models. A population study of GeV PWNe candidates as a functionof the pulsar/PWN system characteristics is presented.

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Two-Season ACTPol Spectra and  Parameters

  We present the temperature and polarization angular power spectra measured bythe Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol). We analyze night-timedata collected during 2013-14 using two detector arrays at 149 GHz, from 548deg$^2$ of sky on the celestial equator. We use these spectra, and the spectrameasured with the MBAC camera on ACT from 2008-10, in combination with Planckand WMAP data to estimate cosmological parameters from the temperature,polarization, and temperature-polarization cross-correlations. We find the newACTPol data to be consistent with the LCDM model. The ACTPoltemperature-polarization cross-spectrum now provides stronger constraints onmultiple parameters than the ACTPol temperature spectrum, including the baryondensity, the acoustic peak angular scale, and the derived Hubble constant.Adding the new data to planck temperature data tightens the limits on dampingtail parameters, for example reducing the joint uncertainty on the number ofneutrino species and the primordial helium fraction by 20%.

Anisotropies in the diffuse gamma-ray background measured by the Fermi  LAT

  The contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse gamma-ray backgroundcould induce anisotropies in this emission on small angular scales. We analyzethe angular power spectrum of the diffuse emission measured by the Fermi LAT atGalactic latitudes |b| > 30 deg in four energy bins spanning 1 to 50 GeV. Atmultipoles \ell \ge 155, corresponding to angular scales \lesssim 2 deg,angular power above the photon noise level is detected at >99.99% CL in the 1-2GeV, 2-5 GeV, and 5-10 GeV energy bins, and at >99% CL at 10-50 GeV. Withineach energy bin the measured angular power takes approximately the same valueat all multipoles \ell \ge 155, suggesting that it originates from thecontribution of one or more unclustered source populations. The amplitude ofthe angular power normalized to the mean intensity in each energy bin isconsistent with a constant value at all energies, C_P/<I>^2 = 9.05 +/- 0.84 x10^{-6} sr, while the energy dependence of C_P is consistent with theanisotropy arising from one or more source populations with power-law photonspectra with spectral index \Gamma_s = 2.40 +/- 0.07. We discuss theimplications of the measured angular power for gamma-ray source populationsthat may provide a contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray background.

Constraining Dark Matter Models from a Combined Analysis of Milky Way  Satellites with the Fermi Large Area Telescope

  Satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are among the most promising targets fordark matter searches in gamma rays. We present a search for dark matterconsisting of weakly interacting massive particles, applying a joint likelihoodanalysis to 10 satellite galaxies with 24 months of data of the Fermi LargeArea Telescope. No dark matter signal is detected. Including the uncertainty inthe dark matter distribution, robust upper limits are placed on dark matterannihilation cross sections. The 95% confidence level upper limits range fromabout 1e-26 cm^3 s^-1 at 5 GeV to about 5e-23 cm^3 s^-1 at 1 TeV, depending onthe dark matter annihilation final state. For the first time, using gamma rays,we are able to rule out models with the most generic cross section (~3e-26 cm^3s^-1 for a purely s-wave cross section), without assuming additional boostfactors.

Inferred cosmic-ray spectrum from ${\it Fermi}$-LAT $γ$-ray  observations of the Earth's limb

  Recent accurate measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) species by ATIC-2, CREAM, andPAMELA reveal an unexpected hardening in the proton and He spectra above a fewhundred GeV, a gradual softening of the spectra just below a few hundred GeV,and a harder spectrum of He compared to that of protons. These newly-discoveredfeatures may offer a clue to the origin of high-energy CRs. We use the ${\itFermi}$ Large Area Telescope observations of the $\gamma$-ray emission from theEarth's limb for an indirect measurement of the local spectrum of CR protons inthe energy range $\sim 90~$GeV-$6~$TeV (derived from a photon energy range$15~$GeV-$1~$TeV). Our analysis shows that single power law and broken powerlaw spectra fit the data equally well and yield a proton spectrum with index$2.68 \pm 0.04$ and $2.61 \pm 0.08$ above $\sim 200~$GeV, respectively.

Measurement of separate cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra with  the Fermi Large Area Telescope

  We measured separate cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra with the FermiLarge Area Telescope. Because the instrument does not have an onboard magnet,we distinguish the two species by exploiting the Earth's shadow, which isoffset in opposite directions for opposite charges due to the Earth's magneticfield. We estimate and subtract the cosmic-ray proton background using twodifferent methods that produce consistent results. We report the electron-onlyspectrum, the positron-only spectrum, and the positron fraction between 20 GeVand 200 GeV. We confirm that the fraction rises with energy in the 20-100 GeVrange. The three new spectral points between 100 and 200 GeV are consistentwith a fraction that is continuing to rise with energy.

Constraints on the Galactic Halo Dark Matter from Fermi-LAT Diffuse  Measurements

  We have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with theFermi Large Area Telescope in the Milky Way Halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. In the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. We consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse Comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. Conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. A second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using theGALPROP code. Uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the Galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. The resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early Universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the PAMELA/Fermi-LAT cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

Binary Millisecond Pulsar Discovery via Gamma-Ray Pulsations

  Millisecond pulsars, old neutron stars spun-up by accreting matter from acompanion star, can reach high rotation rates of hundreds of revolutions persecond. Until now, all such "recycled" rotation-powered pulsars have beendetected by their spin-modulated radio emission. In a computing-intensive blindsearch of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (with partialconstraints from optical data), we detected a 2.5-millisecond pulsar, PSRJ1311-3430. This unambiguously explains a formerly unidentified gamma-raysource that had been a decade-long enigma, confirming previous conjectures. Thepulsar is in a circular orbit with an orbital period of only 93 minutes, theshortest of any spin-powered pulsar binary ever found.

Search for Dark Matter Satellites using the FERMI-LAT

  Numerical simulations based on the Lambda-CDM model of cosmology predict alarge number of as yet unobserved Galactic dark matter satellites. We reportthe results of a Large Area Telescope (LAT) search for these satellites via thegamma-ray emission expected from the annihilation of weakly interacting massiveparticle (WIMP) dark matter. Some dark matter satellites are expected to havehard gamma-ray spectra, finite angular extents, and a lack of counterparts atother wavelengths. We sought to identify LAT sources with thesecharacteristics, focusing on gamma-ray spectra consistent with WIMPannihilation through the $b \bar b$ channel. We found no viable dark mattersatellite candidates using one year of data, and we present a framework forinterpreting this result in the context of numerical simulations to constrainthe velocity-averaged annihilation cross section for a conventional 100 GeVWIMP annihilating through the $b \bar b$ channel.

GeV Observations of Star-forming Galaxies with \textit{Fermi} LAT

  Recent detections of the starburst galaxies M82 and NGC 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. Buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 GeV using 3 years ofdata collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the \textit{Fermi Gamma-raySpace Telescope} (\textit{Fermi}). Measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. We find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the Local Group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $P$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). The normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(L_{0.1-100 \rm{GeV}}/L_{1.4 \rm{GHz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(L_{0.1-100 \rm{GeV}}/L_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function.Using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0<z<2.5$ above 0.1 GeV is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the LAT). We anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{Fermi} mission.

Dark Matter Constraints from Observations of 25 Milky Way Satellite  Galaxies with the Fermi Large Area Telescope

  The dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are some of the mostdark-matter-dominated objects known. Due to their proximity, high dark mattercontent, and lack of astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal galaxies arewidely considered to be among the most promising targets for the indirectdetection of dark matter via gamma rays. Here we report on gamma-rayobservations of 25 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies based on 4years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. None of the dwarf galaxies aresignificantly detected in gamma rays, and we present gamma-ray flux upperlimits between 500 MeV and 500 GeV. We determine the dark matter content of 18dwarf spheroidal galaxies from stellar kinematic data and combine LATobservations of 15 dwarf galaxies to constrain the dark matter annihilationcross section. We set some of the tightest constraints to date on the theannihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 2 GeV and 10 TeV intoprototypical Standard Model channels. We find these results to be robustagainst systematic uncertainties in the LAT instrument performance, diffusegamma-ray background modeling, and assumed dark matter density profile.

Measurement of Target and Double-spin Asymmetries for the $\vec e\vec  p\to eπ^+ (n)$ Reaction in the Nucleon Resonance Region at Low $Q^2$

  We report measurements of target- and double-spin asymmetries for theexclusive channel $\vec e\vec p\to e\pi^+ (n)$ in the nucleon resonance regionat Jefferson Lab using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). Theseasymmetries were extracted from data obtained using a longitudinally polarizedNH$_3$ target and a longitudinally polarized electron beam with energies 1.1,1.3, 2.0, 2.3 and 3.0 GeV. The new results are consistent with previous CLASpublications but are extended to a low $Q^2$ range from $0.0065$ to $0.35$(GeV$/c$)$^2$. The $Q^2$ access was made possible by a custom-built Cherenkovdetector that allowed the detection of electrons for scattering angles as lowas $6^\circ$. These results are compared with the unitary isobar models JANRand MAID, the partial-wave analysis prediction from SAID and the dynamic modelDMT. In many kinematic regions our results, in particular results on the targetasymmetry, help to constrain the polarization-dependent components of thesemodels.

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Lensing of CMB Temperature and  Polarization Derived from Cosmic Infrared Background Cross-Correlation

  We present a measurement of the gravitational lensing of the Cosmic MicrowaveBackground (CMB) temperature and polarization fields obtained bycross-correlating the reconstructed convergence signal from the first season ofACTPol data at 146 GHz with Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) fluctuationsmeasured using the Planck satellite. Using an overlap area of 206 squaredegrees, we detect gravitational lensing of the CMB polarization by large-scalestructure at a statistical significance of 4.5 sigma. Combining both CMBtemperature and polarization data gives a lensing detection at 9.1 sigmasignificance. A B-mode polarization lensing signal is present with asignificance of 3.2 sigma. We also present the first measurement of CMBlensing--CIB correlation at small scales corresponding to l > 2000. Null testsand systematic checks show that our results are not significantly biased byastrophysical or instrumental systematic effects, including Galactic dust.Fitting our measurements to the best-fit lensing-CIB cross power spectrummeasured in Planck data, scaled by an amplitude A, gives A=1.02 +0.12/-0.18(stat.) +/-0.06(syst.), consistent with the Planck results.

Target and Beam-Target Spin Asymmetries in Exclusive Pion  Electroproduction for $Q^2>1$ GeV$^2$. I. $e p \rightarrow e π^+ n$

  Beam-target double-spin asymmetries and target single-spin asymmetries weremeasured for the exclusive $\pi^+$ electroproduction reaction $\gamma^* p \to n\pi^+$. The results were obtained from scattering of 6 GeV longitudinallypolarized electrons off longitudinally polarized protons using the CEBAF LargeAcceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic range covered is$1.1<W<3$ GeV and $1<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$. Results were obtained for about 6000 binsin $W$, $Q^2$, $\cos(\theta^*)$, and $\phi^*$. Except at forward angles, verylarge target-spin asymmetries are observed over the entire $W$ region.Reasonable agreement is found with phenomenological fits to previous data for$W<1.6$ GeV, but very large differences are seen at higher values of $W$. AGPD-based model is in poor agreement with the data. When combined with crosssection measurements, the present results provide powerful constraints onnucleon resonance amplitudes at moderate and large values of $Q^2$, forresonances with masses as high as 2.4 GeV.

Target and beam-target spin asymmetries in exclusive pion  electroproduction for $Q^2>1$ GeV$^2$. II. $e p \rightarrow e π^0 p$

  Beam-target double-spin asymmetries and target single-spin asymmetries weremeasured for the exclusive $\pi^0$ electroproduction reaction $\gamma^* p \to p\pi^0$, expanding an analysis of the $\gamma^* p \to n \pi^+$ reaction from thesame experiment. The results were obtained from scattering of 6 GeVlongitudinally polarized electrons off longitudinally polarized protons usingthe CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic rangecovered is $1.1<W<3$ GeV and $1<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$. Results were obtained for about5700 bins in $W$, $Q^2$, \cthcm, and $\phi^*$. The beam-target asymmetries werefound to generally be greater than zero, with relatively modest \phicmspdependence. The target asymmetries exhibit very strong \phicmsp dependence,with a change in sign occurring between results at low $W$ and high $W$, incontrast to $\pi^+$ electroproduction. Reasonable agreement is found withphenomenological fits to previous data for $W<1.6$ GeV, but significantdifferences are seen at higher $W$. When combined with cross sectionmeasurements, as well as $\pi^+$ observables, the present results will providepowerful constraints on nucleon resonance amplitudes at moderate and largevalues of $Q^2$, for resonances with masses as high as 2.4 GeV.

The Spectral Energy Distribution of Fermi bright blazars

  (Abridged) We have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the Fermi LAT BrightAGN Sample (LBAS). By combining our accurately estimated Fermi gamma-rayspectra with Swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard X-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the LBAS data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous Spectral EnergyDistributions (SED) for 48 LBAS blazars.The SED of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual Log $\nu $ - Log $\nu$ F$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse Compton emission of one or morecomponents. We have used these SEDs to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. The results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to X-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. Our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^S$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ Hz in broad-lined FSRQs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ Hz infeatureless BL Lacertae objects.We find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the X-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse Comptonscenarios. However, simple homogeneous, one-zone, Synchrotron Self Compton(SSC) models cannot explain most of our SEDs, especially in the case of FSRQsand low energy peaked (LBL) BL Lacs. (...)

First Measurement of the Polarization Observable E in the $\vec p(\vec  γ,π^+)n$ Reaction up to 2.25 GeV

  First results from the longitudinally polarized frozen-spin target (FROST)program are reported. The double-polarization observable E, for the reaction$\vec \gamma \vec p \to \pi^+n$, has been measured using a circularly polarizedtagged-photon beam, with energies from 0.35 to 2.37 GeV. The final-state pionswere detected with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer in Hall B at theThomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. These polarization data agreefairly well with previous partial-wave analyses at low photon energies. Overmuch of the covered energy range, however, significant deviations are observed,particularly in the high-energy region where high-L multipoles contribute. Thedata have been included in new multipole analyses resulting in updated nucleonresonance parameters. We report updated fits from the Bonn-Gatchina, J\"ulich,and SAID groups.

Gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS  1830-211 observed by Fermi LAT

  The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and MeV-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar PKS 1830-211 (z=2.507). Its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (E>100 MeV) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 October 14/15 at 2.9 X 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift Fermi blazars. No published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. Based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. Two large gamma-rayflares of PKS 1830-211 have been detected by the LAT in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. This allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. Swift XRT observations from a dedicated Target ofOpportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of X-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. The spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse Compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. The implications of the LAT data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. Microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

First Exclusive Measurement of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering off  $^4$He: Toward the 3D Tomography of Nuclei

  We report on the first measurement of the beam-spin asymmetry in theexclusive process of coherent deeply virtual Compton scattering off a nucleus.The experiment used the 6 GeV electron beam from the CEBAF accelerator atJefferson Lab incident on a pressurized $^4$He gaseous target placed in frontof the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). The scattered electron wasdetected by CLAS and the photon by a dedicated electromagnetic calorimeter atforward angles. To ensure the exclusivity of the process, a specially designedradial time projection chamber was used to detect the recoiling $^4$He nuclei.We measured beam-spin asymmetries larger than those observed on the free protonin the same kinematic domain. From these, we were able to extract, in amodel-independent way, the real and imaginary parts of the only $^4$He Comptonform factor, $\cal H_A$. This first measurement of coherent deeply virtualCompton scattering on the $^4$He nucleus, with a fully exclusive final statevia nuclear recoil tagging, leads the way toward 3D imaging of the partonicstructure of nuclei.

Multi-wavelength observations of blazar AO 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state

  The blazar AO 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) since its launch in Summer 2008.In addition to the continuous coverage by Fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 Septemberand 2009 February. In this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including F-GAMMA, GASP- WEBT, Kanata, OVRO,RXTE, SMARTS, Swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. We find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-IR/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. On the other hand, the X-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/UV synchrotron spectrum. We tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk Compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 Rg . We model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

Target and Beam-Target Spin Asymmetries in Exclusive $π^+$ and $π^-$  Electroproduction with 1.6 to 5.7 GeV Electrons

  Beam-target double spin asymmetries and target single-spin asymmetries inexclusive $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ electroproduction were obtained from scatteringof 1.6 to 5.7 GeV longitudinally polarized electrons from longitudinallypolarized protons (for $\pi^+$) and deuterons (for $\pi^-$) using the CEBAFLarge Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic rangecovered is $1.1<W<2.6$ GeV and $0.05<Q^2<5$ GeV$^2$, with good anglularcoverage in the forward hemisphere. The asymmetry results were divided intoapproximately 40,000 kinematic bins for $\pi^+$ from free protons and 15,000bins for $\pi^-$ production from bound nucleons in the deuteron. The presentresults are found to be in reasonable agreement with fits to previous worlddata for $W<1.7$ GeV and $Q^2<0.5$ GeV$^2$, with discrepancies increasing athigher values of $Q^2$, especially for $W>1.5$ GeV. Very large target-spinasymmetries are observed for $W>1.6$ GeV. When combined with cross sectionmeasurements, the present results will provide powerful constraints on nucleonresonance amplitudes at moderate and large values of $Q^2$, for resonances withmasses as high as 2.3 GeV.

Deep Broadband Observations of the Distant Gamma-ray Blazar PKS 1424+240

  We present deep VERITAS observations of the blazar PKS 1424+240, along withcontemporaneous Fermi Large Area Telescope, Swift X-ray Telescope and Swift UVOptical Telescope data between 2009 February 19 and 2013 June 8. This blazarresides at a redshift of $z\ge0.6035$, displaying a significantly attenuatedgamma-ray flux above 100 GeV due to photon absorption via pair-production withthe extragalactic background light. We present more than 100 hours of VERITASobservations from three years, a multiwavelength light curve and thecontemporaneous spectral energy distributions. The source shows a higher fluxof (2.1$\pm0.3$)$\times10^{-7}$ ph m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 120 GeV in 2009 and2011 as compared to the flux measured in 2013, corresponding to(1.02$\pm0.08$)$\times10^{-7}$ ph m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 120 GeV. The measureddifferential very high energy (VHE; $E\ge100$ GeV) spectral indices are$\Gamma=$3.8$\pm$0.3, 4.3$\pm$0.6 and 4.5$\pm$0.2 in 2009, 2011 and 2013,respectively. No significant spectral change across the observation epochs isdetected. We find no evidence for variability at gamma-ray opacities of greaterthan $\tau=2$, where it is postulated that any variability would be small andoccur on longer than year timescales if hadronic cosmic-ray interactions withextragalactic photon fields provide a secondary VHE photon flux. The datacannot rule out such variability due to low statistics.

Precise Determination of the Deuteron Spin Structure at Low to Moderate  $Q^2$ with CLAS and Extraction of the Neutron Contribution

  We present the final results for the deuteron spin structure functionsobtained from the full data set collected with Jefferson Lab's CLAS in2000-2001. Polarized electrons with energies of 1.6, 2.5, 4.2 and 5.8 GeV werescattered from deuteron ($^{15}$ND$_3$) targets, dynamically polarized alongthe beam direction, and detected with CLAS. From the measured double spinasymmetry, the virtual photon absorption asymmetry $A_1^d$ and the polarizedstructure function $g_1^d$ were extracted over a wide kinematic range (0.05GeV$^2 < Q^2 <$ 5 GeV$^2$ and 0.9 GeV $< W <$ 3 GeV). We use an unfoldingprocedure and a parametrization of the corresponding proton results to extractfrom these data the polarized structure functions $A_1^n$ and $g_1^n$ of the(bound) neutron, which are so far unknown in the resonance region, $W < 2$ GeV.We compare our final results, including several moments of the deuteron andneutron spin structure functions, with various theoretical models andexpectations as well as parametrizations of the world data. The unprecedentedprecision and dense kinematic coverage of these data can aid in futureextractions of polarized parton distributions, tests of perturbative QCDpredictions for the quark polarization at large $x$, a better understanding ofquark-hadron duality, and more precise values for higher-twist matrix elementsin the framework of the Operator Product Expansion.

A search for baryon- and lepton-number violating decays of $Λ$  hyperons using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory

  We present a search for ten baryon-number violating decay modes of $\Lambda$hyperons using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory. Nine of these decaymodes result in a single meson and single lepton in the final state ($\Lambda\rightarrow m \ell$) and conserve either the sum or the difference of baryonand lepton number ($B \pm L$). The tenth decay mode ($\Lambda \rightarrow\bar{p}\pi^+$) represents a difference in baryon number of two units and nodifference in lepton number. We observe no significant signal and set upperlimits on the branching fractions of these reactions in the range$(4-200)\times 10^{-7}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level.

Exclusive $η$ electroproduction at $W>2$ GeV with CLAS and  transversity generalized parton distributions

  The cross section of the exclusive $\eta$ electroproduction reaction $ep\toe^\prime p^\prime \eta$ was measured at Jefferson Lab with a 5.75-GeV electronbeam and the CLAS detector. Differential cross sections$d^4\sigma/dtdQ^2dx_Bd\phi_\eta$ and structure functions $\sigma_U =\sigma_T+\epsilon\sigma_L, \sigma_{TT}$ and $\sigma_{LT}$, as functions of $t$were obtained over a wide range of $Q^2$ and $x_B$. The $\eta$ structurefunctions are compared with those previously measured for $\pi^0$ at the samekinematics. At low $t$, both $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ are described reasonably wellby generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in which chiral-odd transversityGPDs are dominant. The $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ data, when taken together, canfacilitate the flavor decomposition of the transversity GPDs.

Semi-Inclusive $π_0$ target and beam-target asymmetries from 6 GeV  electron scattering with CLAS

  We present precision measurements of the target and beam-target spinasymmetries from neutral pion electroproduction in deep-inelastic scattering(DIS) using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. Wescattered 6-GeV, longitudinally polarized electrons off longitudinallypolarized protons in a cryogenic $^{14}$NH$_3$ target, and extracted double andsingle target spin asymmetries for $ep\rightarrow e^\prime\pi^0X$ inmultidimensional bins in four-momentum transfer ($1.0<Q^2<3.2$ GeV$^2$),Bjorken-$x$ ($0.12<x<0.48$), hadron energy fraction ($0.4<z<0.7$), transversepion momentum ($0<P_T<1.0$ GeV), and azimuthal angle $\phi_h$ between thelepton scattering and hadron production planes. We extracted asymmetries as afunction of both $x$ and $P_T$, which provide access to transverse-momentumdistributions of longitudinally polarized quarks. The double spin asymmetriesdepend weakly on $P_T$. The $\sin 2\phi_h$ moments are zero withinuncertainties, which is consistent with the expected suppression of the Collinsfragmentation function. The observed $\sin\phi_h$ moments suggest that quarkgluon correlations are significant at large $x$.

Towards a resolution of the proton form factor problem: new electron and  positron scattering data

  There is a significant discrepancy between the values of the proton electricform factor, $G_E^p$, extracted using unpolarized and polarized electronscattering. Calculations predict that small two-photon exchange (TPE)contributions can significantly affect the extraction of $G_E^p$ from theunpolarized electron-proton cross sections. We determined the TPE contributionby measuring the ratio of positron-proton to electron-proton elastic scatteringcross sections using a simultaneous, tertiary electron-positron beam incidenton a liquid hydrogen target and detecting the scattered particles in theJefferson Lab CLAS detector. This novel technique allowed us to cover a widerange in virtual photon polarization ($\varepsilon$) and momentum transfer($Q^2$) simultaneously, as well as to cancel luminosity-related systematicerrors. The cross section ratio increases with decreasing $\varepsilon$ at $Q^2= 1.45 \text{ GeV}^2$. This measurement is consistent with the size of the formfactor discrepancy at $Q^2\approx 1.75$ GeV$^2$ and with hadronic calculationsincluding nucleon and $\Delta$ intermediate states, which have been shown toresolve the discrepancy up to $2-3$ GeV$^2$.

First measurement of the helicity asymmetry $E$ in $η$  photoproduction on the proton

  Results are presented for the first measurement of the double-polarizationhelicity asymmetry E for the $\eta$ photoproduction reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow \eta p$. Data were obtained using the FROzen Spin Target (FROST)with the CLAS spectrometer in Hall B at Jefferson Lab, covering a range ofcenter-of-mass energy W from threshold to 2.15 GeV and a large range incenter-of-mass polar angle. As an initial application of these data, theresults have been incorporated into the J\"ulich model to examine the case forthe existence of a narrow $N^*$ resonance between 1.66 and 1.70 GeV. Theaddition of these data to the world database results in marked changes in thepredictions for the E observable using that model. Further comparison withseveral theoretical approaches indicates these data will significantly enhanceour understanding of nucleon resonances.

Differential Cross Section Measurements for $γn\toπ^-p$ Above  the First Nucleon Resonance Region

  The quasi-free $\gamma d\to\pi^{-}p(p)$ differential cross section has beenmeasured with CLAS at photon beam energies $E_\gamma$ from 0.445 GeV to 2.510GeV (corresponding to $W$ from 1.311 GeV to 2.366 GeV) for pion center-of-massangles $\cos\theta_\pi^{c.m.}$ from -0.72 to 0.92. A correction for final stateinteractions has been applied to this data to extract the $\gamma n\to\pi^-p$differential cross sections. These cross sections are quoted in 8428$(E_\gamma,\cos\theta_\pi^{c.m.})$ bins, a factor of nearly three increase inthe world statistics for this channel in this kinematic range. These new datahelp to constrain coupled-channel analysis fits used to disentangle thespectrum of $N^*$ resonances and extract their properties. Selected photondecay amplitudes $N^* \to \gamma n$ at the resonance poles are determined forthe first time and are reported here.

Photon beam asymmetry $Σ$ in the reaction $\vecγ p \to p  ω$ for $E_γ$ = 1.152 to 1.876 GeV

  Photon beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ measurements for $\omega$ photoproduction inthe reaction $\vec{\gamma} p \to \omega p$ are reported for photon energiesfrom 1.152 to 1.876 GeV. Data were taken using a linearly-polarized taggedphoton beam, a cryogenic hydrogen target, and the CLAS spectrometer in Hall Bat Jefferson Lab. The measurements obtained markedly increase the size of thedatabase for this observable, extend coverage to higher energies, and resolvediscrepancies in previously published data. Comparisons of these new resultswith predictions from a chiral-quark-based model and from a dynamicalcoupled-channels model indicate the importance of interferences between$t$-channel meson exchange and $s$- and $u$-channel contributions, underscoringsensitivity to the nucleon resonances included in those descriptions.Comparisons with the Bonn-Gatchina partial-wave analysis indicate the $\Sigma$data reported here help to fix the magnitudes of the interference terms betweenthe leading amplitudes in that calculation (Pomeron exchange and the resonantportion of the $J^P=3/2^+$ partial wave), as well as the resonant portions ofthe smaller partial waves with $J^P$= $1/2^-$, $3/2^-$, and $5/2^+$.
