A Survey of Tree Convex Sets Test

  Tree convex sets refer to a collection of sets such that each set in thecollection is a subtree of a tree whose nodes are the elements of these sets.They extend the concept of row convex sets each of which is an interval over atotal ordering of the elements of those sets. They have been applied toidentify tractable Constraint Satisfaction Problems and Combinatorial AuctionProblems. Recently, polynomial algorithms have been proposed to recognize treeconvex sets. In this paper, we review the materials that are the key to alinear recognition algorithm.

General Scaled Support Vector Machines

  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are popular tools for data mining tasks suchas classification, regression, and density estimation. However, original SVM(C-SVM) only considers local information of data points on or over the margin.Therefore, C-SVM loses robustness. To solve this problem, one approach is totranslate (i.e., to move without rotation or change of shape) the hyperplaneaccording to the distribution of the entire data. But existing work can only beapplied for 1-D case. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient methodcalled General Scaled SVM (GS-SVM) to extend the existing approach tomulti-dimensional case. Our method translates the hyperplane according to thedistribution of data projected on the normal vector of the hyperplane. Comparedwith C-SVM, GS-SVM has better performance on several data sets.

A Novel Model of Working Set Selection for SMO Decomposition Methods

  In the process of training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) by decompositionmethods, working set selection is an important technique, and some excitingschemes were employed into this field. To improve working set selection, wepropose a new model for working set selection in sequential minimaloptimization (SMO) decomposition methods. In this model, it selects B asworking set without reselection. Some properties are given by simple proof, andexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is in general faster thanexisting methods.

Detecting (Un)Important Content for Single-Document News Summarization

  We present a robust approach for detecting intrinsic sentence importance innews, by training on two corpora of document-summary pairs. When used forsingle-document summarization, our approach, combined with the "beginning ofdocument" heuristic, outperforms a state-of-the-art summarizer and thebeginning-of-article baseline in both automatic and manual evaluations. Theseresults represent an important advance because in the absence of cross-documentrepetition, single document summarizers for news have not been able toconsistently outperform the strong beginning-of-article baseline.

A Leaf Recognition Algorithm for Plant Classification Using  Probabilistic Neural Network

  In this paper, we employ Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with image anddata processing techniques to implement a general purpose automated leafrecognition algorithm. 12 leaf features are extracted and orthogonalized into 5principal variables which consist the input vector of the PNN. The PNN istrained by 1800 leaves to classify 32 kinds of plants with an accuracy greaterthan 90%. Compared with other approaches, our algorithm is an accurateartificial intelligence approach which is fast in execution and easy inimplementation.

Automated Epilepsy Diagnosis Using Interictal Scalp EEG

  Approximately over 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy.Traditional diagnosis of epilepsy relies on tedious visual screening by highlytrained clinicians from lengthy EEG recording that contains the presence ofseizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many automatic systems that canrecognize seizure-related EEG signals to help the diagnosis. However, it isvery costly and inconvenient to obtain long-term EEG data with seizureactivities, especially in areas short of medical resources. We demonstrate inthis paper that we can use the interictal scalp EEG data, which is much easierto collect than the ictal data, to automatically diagnose whether a person isepileptic. In our automated EEG recognition system, we extract three classes offeatures from the EEG data and build Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) fedwith these features. We optimize the feature extraction parameters and combinethese PNNs through a voting mechanism. As a result, our system achieves animpressive 94.07% accuracy, which is very close to reported human recognitionaccuracy by experienced medical professionals.

A New Approach to Automated Epileptic Diagnosis Using EEG and  Probabilistic Neural Network

  Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that greatly impairpatient' daily lives. Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visualscreening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presenceof seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping theneurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal byautomatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, ifnot impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities forepilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.Therefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictalEEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are notaware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accuratelydistinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. Theresearch presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automateddiagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether theperson is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities forfurther investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring. To developsuch a system, we extract four classes of features from the EEG data and builda Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) fed with these features. Leave-one-outcross-validation (LOO-CV) on a widely used epileptic-normal data set reflectsan impressive 99.5% accuracy of our system on distinguishing normal people'sEEG from patient's interictal EEG. We also find our system can be used inpatient monitoring (seizure detection) and seizure focus localization, with96.7% and 77.5% accuracy respectively on the data set.
