  A set of Bell inequalities classifying the quantum entanglement of four-qubitstates is presented. These inequalities involve only two measurement settingsper observer and can characterize fully separable, bi-separable andtri-separable quantum states. In addition, a quadratic inequality of the Belloperators for four-qubit systems is derived.

Coherence Length of Excitons in a Semiconductor Quantum Well

  We report on the first experimental determination of the coherence length ofexcitons in semiconductors using the combination of spatially resolvedphotoluminescence with phonon sideband spectroscopy. The coherence length ofexcitons in ZnSe quantum wells is determined to be 300 ~ 400 nm, about 25 ~ 30times the exciton de Broglie wavelength. With increasing exciton kineticenergy, the coherence length decreases slowly. The discrepancy between thecoherence lengths measured and calculated by only considering the acousticphonon scattering suggests an important influence of static disorder.

Solid immersion lens-enhanced micro-photoluminescence: principle and  applications

  We demonstrate the combination of a hemispherical solid immersion lens with amicro-photoluminescence setup. Two advantages introduced by the SIL, animproved resolution of 0.4 times the wavelength in vacuum and a 5 timesenhancement of the collection efficiency, make it an ideal system for spatiallyresolved spectroscopy applications. The influence of the air gap between theSIL and the sample surface is investigated in detail. We confirm the toleranceof the set--up to an air gap of several micrometers. Such a system is proven tobe ideal system in the studies of exciton transport and polarization dependentsingle quantum dot spectroscopy.

Temperature dependence of ambipolar diffusion in silicon-on-insulator

  Spatiotemporal dynamics of electron-hole pairs locally excited in asilicon-on-insulator structure by indirect interband absorption are studied bymeasuring differential transmission caused by free-carrier absorption of aprobe pulse tuned below the bandgap, with 200-fs temporal and 3-micrometerspatial resolution. From sample temperatures of 250 K to 400 K, the ambipolardiffusivity decreases, and is similar to reported values of bulk silicon.Cooling the sample from 250 K to 90 K, a decrease of ambipolar diffusivity isobserved, indicating important influences of defects and residual stress oncarrier diffusion. No detectable density dependence of ambipolar diffusivity isobserved.

All-optical generation and detection of sub-picosecond ac spin current  pulses in GaAs

  Sub-picosecond ac spin current pulses are generated optically in GaAs bulkand quantum wells at room temperature and 90K through quantum interferencebetween one-photon and two-photon absorptions driven by two phase-lockedultrafast laser pulses that are both circularly polarized. The dynamics of thecurrent pulses are detected optically by monitoring in real time and real spacenanoscale motion of electrons with high-resolution pump-probe techniques.

Diagnostics for Variational Bayes approximations

  Variational Bayes (VB) has shown itself to be a powerful approximation methodin many application areas. This paper describes some diagnostics methods whichcan assess how well the VB approximates the true posterior, particularly withregards to its covariance structure. The methods proposed also allow us togenerate simple corrections when the approximation error is large. It looks atjoint, marginal and conditional aspects of the approximate posterior and showshow to apply these techniques in both simulated and real data examples.

Variational Bayes inference and Dirichlet process priors

  This paper shows how the variational Bayes method provides a computationalefficient technique in the context of hierarchical modelling using Dirichletprocess priors, in particular without requiring conjugate prior assumption. Itshows, using the so called parameter separation parameterization, a simplecriterion under which the variational method works well. Based on thisframework, its provides a full variational solution for the Dirichlet process.The numerical results show that the method is very computationally efficientwhen compared to MCMC. Finally, we propose an empirical method to estimate thetruncation level for the truncated Dirichlet process.

Exceptional and Anisotropic Transport Properties of Photocarriers in  Black Phosphorus

  We show that black phosphorus has room-temperature charge mobilities on theorder of 10$^4$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, which are about one order of magnitudelarger than silicon. We also demonstrate strong anisotropic transport in blackphosphorus, where the mobilities along the armchair direction are about oneorder of magnitude larger than zigzag direction. A photocarrier lifetime aslong as 100 ps is also determined. These results illustrate that blackphosphorus is a promising candidate for future electronic and optoelectronicapplications.

Bound entanglement and distillability of multipartite quantum systems

  We construct a class of entangled states in$\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_{A}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{B}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{C}$quantum systems with$dim\mathcal{H}_{A}=dim\mathcal{H}_{B}=dim\mathcal{H}_{C}=2$ and classify thosestates with respect to their distillability properties. The states are boundentanglement for the bipartite split$(AB)-C$. The states are NPT entanglementand $1$-copy undistillable for the bipartite splits $A-(BC)$ and $B-(AC)$.Moreover, we generalize the results of $2\otimes2\otimes2$ systems to the caseof $2n\otimes 2n\otimes2n$ systems.

Unextendible maximally entangled bases and mutually unbiased bases in  multipartite systems

  We generalize the notion of unextendible maximally entangled basis frombipartite systems to multipartite quantum systems. It is proved that there donot exist unextendible maximally entangled bases in three-qubit systems.Moreover,two types of unextendible maximally entangled bases are constructed intripartite quantum systems and proved to be not mutually unbiased.

Conformal Mesh Parameterization Using Discrete Calabi Flow

  In this paper, we introduce discrete Calabi flow to the graphics researchcommunity and present a novel conformal mesh parameterization algorithm. Calabienergy has a succinct and explicit format. Its corresponding flow is conformaland convergent under certain conditions. Our method is based on the Calabienergy and Calabi flow with solid theoretical and mathematical base. Wedemonstrate our approach on dozens of models and compare it with other relatedflow based methods, such as the well-known Ricci flow and CETM. Our experimentsshow that the performance of our algorithm is comparably the same with othermethods. The discrete Calabi flow in our method provides another perspective onconformal flow and conformal parameterization.

Ergodic Capacity Under Power Adaption Over Fisher-Snedecor F Fading  Channels

  In this letter, we consider a communication scenario, where the transmitteradopts different power adaption methods according to the instantaneous channelstate to enhance the ergodic capacity (EC) over Fisher-Snedecor F fadingchannels. We derive closed-form expressions for the EC under different poweradaption methods, as well as the corresponding asymptotic EC formulas to getsome insights in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. In the numericalresults section, we compare the performance of different adaptive powertransmission strategies, and demonstrate the accuracy of our derivedexpressions.

Thermodynamics and critical behaviors of topological dS black holes with  nonlinear source

  We discuss black hole solutions of Einstein gravity in presence of nonlinearelectrodynamics in dS spacetime. Considering prescribed entropy, thermodynamicvolume of dS spacetime, We investigate properties of the effectivethermodynamic quantities under influence of nonlinearity parameter $\alpha$.They show a similar phase transition and criticality properties with that ofblack holes in AdS spacetime. And the nonlinearity parameter $\alpha$ combinedwith electric charge is found to have effects on the phase structure. By theEhrenfest equations we prove the critical phase transition is a second orderequilibrium transition.

Averaging principle for one dimensional stochastic Burgers equation

  In this paper, we consider the averaging principle for one dimensionalstochastic Burgers equation with slow and fast time-scales. Under some suitableconditions, we show that the slow component strongly converges to the solutionof the corresponding averaged equation. Meanwhile, when there is no noise inthe slow component equation, we also prove that the slow component weaklyconverges to the solution of the corresponding averaged equation with the orderof convergence $1-r$, for any $0<r<1$.

Nonreciprocal photon blockade via quadratic optomechanical coupling

  We propose to manipulate the statistic properties of the photons transportnonreciprocally via quadratic optomechanical coupling. We present a scheme togenerate quadratic optomechanical interactions in the normal optical modes of awhispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optomechanical system by eliminating the linearoptomechanical couplings via anticrossing of different modes. By opticallypumping the WGM optomechanical system in one direction, the effective quadraticoptomechanical coupling in that direction will be enhanced significantly, andnonreciprocal photon blockade will be observed consequently. Our proposal haspotential applications for the on-chip nonreciprocal single-photon devices.

A Note on Entanglement of Formation and Generalized Concurrence

  We discuss a kind of generalized concurrence for a class of high dimensionalquantum pure states such that the entanglement of formation is a monotonicallyincreasing convex function of the generalized concurrence. An analyticalexpression of the entanglement of formation for a class of high dimensionalquantum mixed states is obtained.

A Report on Shape Deformation with a Stretching and Bending Energy

  In this report we describe a mesh editing system that we implemented thatuses a natural stretching and bending energy defined over smooth surfaces. Assuch, this energy behaves uniformly under various mesh resolutions. All of theelements of our approach already exist in the literature. We hope that ourdiscussions of these energies helps to shed light on the behaviors of thesemethods and provides a unified discussion of these methods.

Nanotwin-Dominant Superstructures Selectively Grown on Anatase {001}  Facets

  homo/heterojunction renders fascinating electronic, optical, mechanical,chemical properties, yet a facile synthesis of this structure remains achallenge.

Shot Noise for Entangled Electrons with Berry Phase

  We study shot noise for entangled electrons in a 4-lead beam-splitter withone incoming lead driven by adiabatically rotating magnetic fields. We proposea setup of an adiabatically rotating magnetic field therefor, which isappropriate for an electron beam to transport through. Using the scatteringmatrix approach, we find that shot noise for the singlet and that for theentangled triplet oscillates between bunching and antibunching due to theinfluence of the Berry phase. It provides us a new approach for testing theBerry phase in electron transport on the basis of entanglement.

Implement Quantum Random Walks with Linear Optics Elements

  The quantum random walk has drawn special interests because its remarkablefeatures to the classical counterpart could lead to new quantum algorithms. Inthis paper, we propose a feasible scheme to implement quantum random walks on aline using only linear optics elements. With current single-photon interferencetechnology, the steps that could be experimentally implemented can be extendedto very large numbers. We also show that, by decohering the quantum states, ourscheme for quantum random walk tends to be classical.

Energy relaxation during hot-exciton transport in quantum wells: Direct  observation by spatially resolved phonon-sideband spectroscopy

  We investigate the energy relaxation of excitons during the real-spacetransport in ZnSe quantum wells by using microphotoluminescence with spatialresolution enhanced by a solid immersion lens. The spatial evolution of theLO-phonon sideband, originating from the LO-phonon assisted recombination ofhot excitons, is measured directly. By calculating the LO-phonon assistedrecombination probability, we obtain the nonthermal energy distribution ofexcitons and observe directly the energy relaxation of hot excitons duringtheir transport. We find the excitons remain hot during their transport on alength scale of several micrometers. Thus, the excitonic transport on thisscale cannot be described by classical diffusion.

Effect of quantum confinement on exciton-phonon interactions

  We investigate the homogeneous linewidth of localized type-I excitons intype-II GaAs/AlAs superlattices. These localizing centers represent theintermediate case between quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) andquasi-zero-dimensional localizations. The temperature dependence of thehomogeneous linewidth is obtained with high precision frommicro-photoluminescence spectra. We confirm the reduced interaction of theexcitons with their environment with decreasing dimensionality except for thecoupling to LO-phonons. The low-temperature limit for the linewidth of theselocalized excitons is five times smaller than that of Q2D excitons. Thecoefficient of exciton-acoustic-phonon interaction is 5 ~ 6 times smaller thanthat of Q2D excitons. An enhancement of the average exciton-LO-phononinteraction by localization is found in our sample. But this interaction isvery sensitive to the detailed structure of the localizing centers.

Spatio-temporal dynamics of quantum-well excitons

  We investigate the lateral transport of excitons in ZnSe quantum wells byusing time-resolved micro-photoluminescence enhanced by the introduction of asolid immersion lens. The spatial and temporal resolutions are 200 nm and 5 ps,respectively. Strong deviation from classical diffusion is observed up to 400ps. This feature is attributed to the hot-exciton effects, consistent withprevious experiments under cw excitation. The coupled transport-relaxationprocess of hot excitons is modelled by Monte Carlo simulation. We prove thattwo basic assumptions typically accepted in photoluminescence investigations onexcitonic transport, namely (i) the classical diffusion model as well as (ii)the equivalence between the temporal and spatial evolution of the excitonpopulation and of the measured photoluminescence, are not valid forlow-temperature experiments.

Hot exciton transport in ZnSe quantum wells

  The in-plane transport of excitons in ZnSe quantum wells is investigateddirectly by microphotoluminescence in combination with a solid immersion lens.Due to the strong Froehlich coupling, the initial kinetic energy of theexcitons is well controlled by choosing the excess energy of the excitationlaser. When increasing the laser excess energy, we find a general trend ofincreasing transport length and more importantly a pronounced periodicquenching of the transport length when the excess energy corresponds tomultiples of the LO-phonon energy. Such features show the dominant role of thekinetic energy of excitons in the transport process. Together with theexcitation intensity dependence of the transport length, we distinguish thephonon wind driven transport of cold excitons and defect-limited hot excitontransport.

Ambipolar spin diffusion and D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation in GaAs  quantum wells

  We report theoretical and experimental studies of ambipolar spin diffusion ina semiconductor. A circularly polarized laser pulse is used to excitespin-polarized carriers in a GaAs multiple quantum well sample at 80 K.Diffusion of electron and spin densities is simultaneously measured using aspatially and temporally resolved pump-probe technique. Two regimes ofdiffusion for spin-polarized electrons are observed. Initially, the rate ofspin diffusion is similar to that of density diffusion and is controlled by theambipolar diffusion coefficient. At later times, the spin diffusion slows downconsiderably relative to the density diffusion and appears to be controlled bya non-constant (decreasing) spin diffusion coefficient. We suggest that thelong-time behavior of the spin density can be understood in terms of aninhomogeneous spin relaxation rate, which grows with decreasing density. Thebehavior of the spin relaxation rate is consistent with a model ofD'yakonov-Perel' relaxation limited by the Coulomb scattering between carriers.

Femtosecond Pump-Probe Studies of Reduced Graphene Oxide Thin Films

  The dynamics of photocarriers in reduced graphene oxide thin films is studiedby using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy. Time dependent differentialtransmissions are measured with sample temperatures ranging from 9 to 300 K. Ateach sample temperature and probe delay, the sign of differential transmissionremains positive. A fast energy relaxation of hot carriers is observed, and isfound to be independent of sample temperature. Our experiments show that thecarrier dynamics in reduced graphene oxide is similar to other types ofgraphene, and that the differential transmission is caused by phase-statefilling of carriers.

Power dependence of pure spin current injection by quantum interference

  We investigate the power dependence of pure spin current injection in GaAsbulk and quantum-well samples by a quantum interference and control technique.Spin separation is measured as a function of the relative strength of the twotransition pathways driven by two laser pulses. By keeping the relaxation timeof the current unchanged, we are able to relate the spin separation to theinjected average velocity. We find that the average velocity is determined bythe relative strength of the two transitions in the same way as in classicalinterference. Based on this, we conclude that the density of injected pure spincurrent increases monotonically with the excitation laser intensities. Theexperimental results are consistent with theoretical calculations based onFermi's golden rule.

Hot carrier diffusion in graphene

  We report an optical study of charge transport in graphene. Diffusion of hotcarriers in epitaxial graphene and reduced graphene oxide samples are studiedusing an ultrafast pump-probe technique with a high spatial resolution.Spatiotemporal dynamics of hot carriers after a point-like excitation aremonitored. Carrier diffusion coefficients of 11,000 and 5,500 squaredcentimeters per second are measured in epitaxial graphene and reduced grapheneoxide samples, respectively, with a carrier temperature on the order of 3,600K. The demonstrated optical techniques can be used for non-contact andnon-invasive in-situ detection of transport properties of graphene.

Ambipolar diffusion of photo-excited carriers in bulk GaAs

  The ambipolar carrier diffusion in bulk GaAs is studied by using an ultrafastpump-probe technique with a high spatial resolution. Carriers with a point-likespatial profile are excited by a tightly focused pump laser pulse. Thespatiotemporal dynamics of the carriers are monitored by a time-delayed andspatially scanned probe pulse. Ambipolar diffusion coefficients are deducedfrom linear fits to the expansion of the area of the profiles, and are found todecrease from about 170~$\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 10 K to about20~$\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at room temperature. Our results areconsistent with those deduced from the previously measured mobilities.

Observation of intrinsic inverse spin Hall effect

  We report observation of intrinsic inverse spin Hall effect in un-doped GaAsmultiple quantum wells with a sample temperature of 10 K. A transient ballisticpure spin current is injected by a pair of laser pulses through quantuminterference. By time-resolving the dynamics of the pure spin current, themomentum relaxation time is deduced, which sets the lower limit of thescattering time between electrons and holes. The transverse charge currentgenerated by the pure spin current via the inverse spin Hall effect issimultaneously resolved. We find that the charge current is generated wellbefore the first electron-hole scattering event. Generation of the transversecurrent in the scattering-free ballistic transport regime provides unambiguousevidence for the intrinsic inverse spin Hall effect.

Two-probe study of hot carriers in reduced graphene oxide

  The energy relaxation of carriers in reduced graphene oxide thin films isstudied using optical pump-probe spectroscopy with two probes of differentcolors. We measure the time difference between peaks of the carrier density ateach probing energy by measuring a time-resolved differential transmission andfind that the carrier density at the lower probing energy peaks later than thatat the higher probing energy. Also, we find that the peak time for the lowerprobing energy shifts from about 92 to 37 fs after the higher probing energypeak as the carrier density is increased from 1.5E12 to 3E13 per squarecentimeter, while no noticeable shift is observed in that for the higherprobing energy. Assuming the carriers rapidly thermalize after excitation, thisindicates that the optical phonon emission time decreases from about 50 toabout 20 fs and the energy relaxation rate increases from 4 to 10 meV/fs. Theobserved density dependence is inconsistent with the phonon bottleneck effect.

Spatially resolved femtosecond pump-probe study of topological insulator  Bi2Se3

  Carrier and phonon dynamics in Bi2Se3 crystals are studied by a spatiallyresolved ultrafast pump-probe technique. Pronounced oscillations indifferential reflection are observed with two distinct frequencies, and areattributed to coherent optical and acoustic phonons, respectively. The risingtime of the signal indicates that the thermalization and energy relaxation ofhot carriers are both sub-ps in this material. We found that the thermalizationand relaxation time decreases with the carrier density. The expansion of thedifferential reflection profile allows us to estimate an ambipolar carrierdiffusion coefficient on the order of 500 square centimeters per second. Along-term slow expansion of the profile shows a thermal diffusion coefficientof 1.2 square centimeters per second.

Optical pump-probe studies of carrier dynamics in few-layer MoS2

  Femtosecond optical pump-probe technique is used to study charge carrierdynamics in few-layer MoS2 samples fabricated by mechanical exfoliation. Anultrafast pump pulse excites carriers and differential reflection of a probepulse tuned to an excitonic resonance is detected. We find that the spectrum ofthe differential reflection signal is similar to the derivative of theresonance. The decay time of the signal is in the range of 150 to 400 ps,increasing with the probe wavelength. With a fixed probe wavelength, the signalmagnitude is proportional to the pump fluence, while the decay time isindependent of it.

Second-harmonic generation induced by electric currents in GaAs

  We demonstrate a new, nonlinear optical effect of electric currents. First, asteady current is generated by applying a voltage on a doped GaAs crystal. Wedemonstrate that this current induces second-harmonic generation of a probelaser pulse. Second, we optically inject a transient current in an undoped GaAscrystal by using a pair of ultrafast laser pulses, and demonstrate that itinduces the same second-harmonic generation. In both cases, the inducedsecond-order nonlinear susceptibility is proportional to the current density.This effect can be used for nondestructive, noninvasive, and ultrafast imagingof currents. These advantages are illustrated by the real-time observations ofa coherent plasma oscillation and spatial resolution of current distribution ina device. This new effect also provides a mechanism for electrical control ofthe optical response of materials.

Spatially resolved pump-probe study of single-layer graphene produced by  chemical vapor deposition

  Carrier dynamics in single-layer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition(CVD) is studied using spatially and temporally resolved pump-probespectroscopy by measuring both differential transmission and differentialreflection. By studying the expansion of a Gaussian spatial profile of carriersexcited by a 1500-nm pump pulse with a 1761-nm probe pulse, we observe adiffusion of hot carriers of 5500 square centimeter per second. We also observethat the expansion of the carrier density profile decreases to a slow ratewithin 1 ps, which is unexpected. Furthermore, by using an 810-nm probe pulsewe observe that both the differential transmission and reflection change signs,but also that this sign change can be permanently removed by exposure of thegraphene to femtosecond laser pulses of relatively high fluence. This indicatesthat the differential transmission and reflection at later times may not bedirectly caused by carriers, but may be from some residue material from thesample fabrication or transfer process.

Ultrafast and spatially resolved studies of charge carriers in  atomically-thin molybdenum disulfide

  Atomically-thin molybdenum disulfide is emerging as a new nanomaterial withpotential applications in the fields of electronic and photonics. Chargecarrier dynamics plays an essential role in determining its electronic andoptical properties. We report spatially and temporally resolved pump-probestudies of charge carriers in atomically-thin molybdenum disulfide samplesfabricated by mechanical exfoliation. Carriers are injected by interbandabsorption of a 390-nm pump pulse and detected by measuring differentialreflection of a time-delayed and spatially-scanned probe pulse that is tuned toan exciton transition. Several parameters on charge carrier dynamics arededuced, including carrier lifetime, diffusion coefficient, diffusion length,and mobility.

Exciton diffusion in semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes studied  by transient absorption microscopy

  Spatiotemporal dynamics of excitons in isolated semiconducting single-walledcarbon nanotubes are studied using transient absorption microscopy.Differential reflection and transmission of an 810-nm probe pulse afterexcitation by a 750-nm pump pulse are measured. We observe a bi-exponentiallydecaying signal with a fast time constant of 0.66 ps and a slower time constantof 2.8 ps. Both constants are independent of the pump fluence. By spatially andtemporally resolving the differential reflection, we are able to observe adiffusion of excitons, and measure a diffusion coefficient of 200 cm2/s at roomtemperature and 300 cm2/s at lower temperatures of 10 K and 150 K.

Third harmonic generation in graphene and few-layer graphite films

  We observe optical third harmonic generation from graphene and few-layergraphite flakes produced by exfoliation. The emission scales with the cube ofthe intensity of the incident near-infrared femtosecond pulses and has awavelength that is one-third of the incident wavelength, both consistent withthird harmonic generation. We extract an effective third-order susceptibilityfor graphene that is on the order of 1e-16 square meter per square volt, whichis comparable to that for materials that are resonantly excited, but largerthan for materials that are transparent at the fundamental and third harmonicwavelengths. By measuring a set of flakes with different numbers of atomiclayers, we find that the emission scales with the square of the number ofatomic layers, which suggests that the susceptibility of graphene isindependent of layer number, at least for a few layers.

Second harmonic microscopy of monolayer MoS2

  We show that the lack of inversion symmetry in monolayer MoS2 allows strongoptical second harmonic generation. Second harmonic of an 810-nm pulse isgenerated in a mechanically exfoliated monolayer, with a nonlinearsusceptibility on the order of 1E-7 m/V. The susceptibility reduces by a factorof seven in trilayers, and by about two orders of magnitude in even layers. Aproof-of-principle second harmonic microscopy measurement is performed onsamples grown by chemical vapor deposition, which illustrates potentialapplications of this effect in fast and non-invasive detection of crystallineorientation, thickness uniformity, layer stacking, and single-crystal domainsize of atomically thin films of MoS2 and similar materials.

Charge carrier dynamics in bulk MoS2 crystal studied by transient  absorption microscopy

  We report a transient absorption microscopy study of charge carrier dynamicsin bulk MoS2 crystals at room temperature. Charge carriers are injected byinterband absorption of a 555-nm pulse, and probed by measuring differentialreflection of a time-delayed and spatially scanned 660-nm pulse. We find anintervalley transfer time of about 0.35 ps, an energy relaxation time of hotcarriers on the order of 50 ps, and a carrier lifetime of 180 ps. By monitoringthe spatiotemporal dynamics of carriers, we obtained a diffusion coefficient ofthermalized electrons of 4.2 cm2/s, corresponding to a mobility of 170 cm2/Vs.We also observed a time-varying diffusion coefficient of hot carriers.

Exciton-exciton annihilation in MoSe2 monolayers

  We investigate the excitonic dynamics in MoSe2 monolayer and bulk samples byfemtosecond transient absorption microscopy. Excitons are resonantly injectedby a 750-nm and 100-fs laser pulse, and are detected by a probe pulse tuned inthe range of 790 - 820 nm. We observe a strong density-dependent initial decayof the exciton population in monolayers, which can be well described by theexciton-exciton annihilation. Such a feature is not observed in the bulk undercomparable conditions. We also observe the saturated absorption induced byexciton phase-space filling in both monolayers and the bulk, which indicatestheir potential applications as saturable absorbers.

Construction of Bound Entangled States Based on Permutation Operators

  We present a construction of new bound entangled states from given boundentangled states for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems. One way toconstruct bound entangled states is to show that these states are PPT (positivepartial transpose) and violate the range criterion at the same time. Byapplying certain operators to given bound entangled states or to one of thesubsystems of the given bound entangled states, we obtain a set of new stateswhich are both PPT and violate the range criterion. We show that the derivedbound entangled states are not local unitary equivalent to the original boundentangled states by detail examples.

Robust Edge-Preserved Surface Mesh Polycube Deformation

  The problem of polycube construction or deformation is an essential problemin computer graphics. In this paper, we present a robust, simple, efficient andautomatic algorithm to deform the meshes of arbitrary shapes into theirpolycube ones. We derive a clear relationship between a mesh and itscorresponding polycube shape. Our algorithm is edge-preserved, and works onsurface meshes with or without boundaries. Our algorithm outperforms previousones in speed, robustness, efficiency. Our method is simple to implement. Todemonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, we apply it tohundreds of models of varying complexity and topology. We demonstrat that ourmethod compares favorably to other state-of-the-art polycube deformationmethods.

The Normal Map Based on Area-Preserving Parameterization

  In this paper, we present an approach to enhance and improve the currentnormal map rendering technique. Our algorithm is based on semi-discrete OptimalMass Transportation (OMT) theory and has a solid theoretical base. The keydifference from previous normal map method is that we preserve the local areawhen we unwrap a disk-like 3D surface onto 2D plane. Compared to the currentlyused techniques which is based on conformal parameterization, our method doesnot need to cut a surface into many small pieces to avoid the large areadistortion. The following charts packing step is also unnecessary in ourframework. Our method is practical and makes the normal map technique morerobust and efficient.

Different Power Adaption Methods on Fluctuating Two-Ray Fading Channels

  In this letter, we consider a typical scenario where the transmitter employsdifferent power adaption methods, including the optimal rate and poweralgorithm, optimal rate adaption, channel inversion and truncated channelinversion, to enhance the ergodic capacity (EC) with an average transmit powerconstraint over fluctuating two-way fading channels. In particular, we deriveexact closed-form expressions for the EC under different power adaptionmethods, as well as corresponding asymptotic formulas for the EC valid in thehigh signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. Finally, we compare the performance ofthe EC under different power adaption methods, and this also validates theaccuracy of our derived expressions for the exact and asymptotic EC.

Correlations of spin-polarized and entangled electrons with Berry phase

  The correlation and fluctuation of both entangled electrons andspin-polarized pairs affected by two rotating magnetic fields in a setupproposed by J. Carlos Egues etc. (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 89}(2002) 176401) arestudied theoretically by using scattering approach. Differing from polarizedpair, the entangled electron pairs are shown to behave like a compositeparticle with the total spins and its $z$ components. The singlet and tripletstates exhibit different bunching and antibunching features, which can beeasily adjusted by the magnetic fields. The correlations and variances can showup distinguish output signals for the four incident states. Our results areexpected to be tested by using coincident technique.

Phase Transition and Clapeyon Equation of Black Hole in Higher  Dimensional AdS Spacetime

  By Maxwell equal area law we study the phase transition in higher dimensionalAnti-de Sitter (AdS) Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole and Kerr black holein this paper. The coexisting region of the two phases involved in the phasetransition is found and the coexisting curves are shown in $P-T$ figures. Wealso analytically investigate the parameters which affect the coexistingcurves. To better compare with ordinary thermodynamic systems, the Clapeyonequation is derived for higher dimensional AdS black holes. This paper can helpto deepen the understanding of the phase transition and phase structure of AdSblack holes.

Two-phase equilibrium properties in charged topological dilaton AdS  black holes

  In this paper we discuss phase transition of the charged topological dilatonAdS black holes by Maxwell equal area law. The two phases involved in the phasetransition could be coexist and we depict the coexistence region in $P-v$diagrams. The two-phase equilibrium curves in $P-T$ diagrams are plotted, theClapeyron equation for the black hole is derived, and the latent heat ofisothermal phase transition is investigated. We also analyze of the parametersof the black hole that have an effect on the two phases coexistence. Theresults show that the black hole may go through a small-large phase transitionsimilar to those of usual non-gravity thermodynamic systems.

Ghost imaging lidar via sparsity constraints

  For remote sensing, high-resolution imaging techniques are helpful to catchmore characteristic information of the target. We extend pseudo-thermal lightghost imaging to the area of remote imaging and propose a ghost imaging lidarsystem. For the first time, we demonstrate experimentally that the real-spaceimage of a target at about 1.0 km range with 20 mm resolution is achieved byghost imaging via sparsity constraints (GISC) technique. The characters of GISCtechnique compared to the existing lidar systems are also discussed.
