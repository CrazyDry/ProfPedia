Possible Implications of a Vortex Gas Model and Self-Similarity for  Tornadogenesis and Maintenance

  We describe tornadogenesis and maintenance using the 3-dimensional vortex gasmodel presented in Chorin (1994) and developed further in Flandoli andGubinelli (2002). We suggest that high-energy, super-critical vortices in thesense of Benjamin (1962), that have been studied by Fiedler and Rotunno (1986),have negative temperature in the sense of Onsager (1949) play an important rolein the model. We speculate that the formation of high-temperature vortices isrelated to the helicity inherited as they form or tilt into the vertical andtheir interaction with the surface and boundary layer. We also exploit thenotion of self-similarity to justify power laws derived from observations ofweak and strong tornadoes presented in Cai (2005); Wurman and Gill (2000);Wurman and Alexander (2005). Analysis of a Bryan Cloud Model (CM1) simulationof a tornadic supercell reveals scaling consistent with the observationalstudies.
