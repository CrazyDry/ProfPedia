Path integral formulation of stochastic optimal control with generalized  costs

  Path integral control solves a class of stochastic optimal control problemswith a Monte Carlo (MC) method for an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)equation. The MC approach avoids the need for a global grid of the domain ofthe HJB equation and, therefore, path integral control is in principleapplicable to control problems of moderate to large dimension. The class ofproblems path integral control can solve, however, is defined by requirementson the cost function, the noise covariance matrix and the control input matrix.We relax the requirements on the cost function by introducing a new state thatrepresents an augmented running cost. In our new formulation the cost functioncan contain stochastic integral terms and linear control costs, which areimportant in applications in engineering, economics and finance. We find anefficient numerical implementation of our grid-free MC approach and demonstrateits performance and usefulness in examples from hierarchical electric loadmanagement. The dimension of one of our examples is large enough to makeclassical grid-based HJB solvers impractical.

Learning Quadrotor Dynamics Using Neural Network for Flight Control

  Traditional learning approaches proposed for controlling quadrotors orhelicopters have focused on improving performance for specific trajectories byiteratively improving upon a nominal controller, for example learning fromdemonstrations, iterative learning, and reinforcement learning. In theseschemes, however, it is not clear how the information gathered from thetraining trajectories can be used to synthesize controllers for more generaltrajectories. Recently, the efficacy of deep learning in inferring helicopterdynamics has been shown. Motivated by the generalization capability of deeplearning, this paper investigates whether a neural network based dynamics modelcan be employed to synthesize control for trajectories different than thoseused for training. To test this, we learn a quadrotor dynamics model using onlytranslational and only rotational training trajectories, each of which can becontrolled independently, and then use it to simultaneously control the yaw andposition of a quadrotor, which is non-trivial because of nonlinear couplingsbetween the two motions. We validate our approach in experiments on a quadrotortestbed.

On the Optimal Solutions of the Infinite-Horizon Linear Sensor  Scheduling Problem

  This paper studies the infinite-horizon sensor scheduling problem for linearGaussian processes with linear measurement functions. Several importantproperties of the optimal infinite-horizon schedules are derived. Inparticular, it is proved that under some mild conditions, both the optimalinfinite-horizon average-per-stage cost and the corresponding optimal sensorschedules are independent of the covariance matrix of the initial state. It isalso proved that the optimal estimation cost can be approximated arbitrarilyclosely by a periodic schedule with a finite period. Moreover, it is shown thatthe sequence of the average-per-stage costs of the optimal schedule mustconverge. These theoretical results provide valuable insights into the designand analysis of various infinite-horizon sensor scheduling algorithms.

Dynamic Contracts with Partial Observations: Application to Indirect  Load Control

  This paper proposes a method to design an optimal dynamic contract between aprincipal and an agent, who has the authority to control both the principal'srevenue and an engineered system. The key characteristic of our problem settingis that the principal has very limited information: the principal has nocapability to monitor the agent's control or the state of the engineeredsystem. The agent has perfect observations. With this asymmetry of information,we show that the principal can induce the agent to control both the revenue andthe system processes in a way that maximizes the principal's utility, if theprincipal offers appropriate real-time and end-time compensation. Wereformulate the dynamic contract design problem as a stochastic optimal controlof both the engineered system and the agent's future expected payoff, which canbe numerically solved using an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Theperformance and usefulness of the proposed contract are demonstrated with anindirect load control problem.

A sampling-based approach to scalable constraint satisfaction in linear  sampled-data systems---Part I: Computation

  Sampled-data (SD) systems, which are composed of both discrete- andcontinuous-time components, are arguably one of the most common classes ofcyberphysical systems in practice; most modern controllers are implemented ondigital platforms while the plant dynamics that are being controlled evolvecontinuously in time. As with all cyberphysical systems, ensuring hardconstraint satisfaction is key in the safe operation of SD systems. A powerfulanalytical tool for guaranteeing such constraint satisfaction is the viabilitykernel: the set of all initial conditions for which a safety-preserving controllaw (that is, a control law that satisfies all input and state constraints)exists. In this paper we present a novel sampling-based algorithm that tightlyapproximates the viability kernel for high-dimensional sampled-data lineartime-invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike prior work in this area, our algorithmformally handles both the discrete and continuous characteristics of SDsystems. We prove the correctness and convergence of our approximationtechnique, provide discussions on heuristic methods to optimally bias thesampling process, and demonstrate the results on a twelve-dimensional flightenvelope protection problem.

Secure Estimation based Kalman Filter for Cyber-Physical Systems against  Adversarial Attacks

  Cyber-physical systems are found in many applications such as power networks,manufacturing processes, and air and ground transportation systems. Maintainingsecurity of these systems under cyber attacks is an important and challengingtask, since these attacks can be erratic and thus difficult to model. Secureestimation problems study how to estimate the true system states whenmeasurements are corrupted and/or control inputs are compromised by attackers.The authors in [1] proposed a secure estimation method when the set of attackednodes (sensors, controllers) is fixed. In this paper, we extend these resultsto scenarios in which the set of attacked nodes can change over time. Weformulate this secure estimation problem into the classical error correctionproblem [2] and we show that accurate decoding can be guaranteed under acertain condition. Furthermore, we propose a combined secure estimation methodwith our proposed secure estimator and the Kalman Filter for improved practicalperformance. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our method throughsimulations of two scenarios where an unmanned aerial vehicle is underadversarial attack.

Safe Sequential Path Planning Under Disturbances and Imperfect  Information

  Multi-UAV systems are safety-critical, and guarantees must be made to ensureno unsafe configurations occur. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is ideal foranalyzing such safety-critical systems; however, its direct application islimited to small-scale systems of no more than two vehicles due to anexponentially-scaling computational complexity. Previously, the sequential pathplanning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to vehicles, wasproposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be done with alinearly-scaling computational complexity. However, the previous formulationassumed that there are no disturbances, and that every vehicle has perfectknowledge of higher-priority vehicles' positions. In this paper, we make SPPmore practical by providing three different methods to account for disturbancesin dynamics and imperfect knowledge of higher-priority vehicles' states. Eachmethod has different assumptions about information sharing. We demonstrate ourproposed methods in simulations.

Building Model Identification during Regular Operation - Empirical  Results and Challenges

  The inter-temporal consumption flexibility of commercial buildings can beharnessed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, or to provideancillary service to the power grid. To do so, a predictive model of thebuilding's thermal dynamics is required. In this paper, we identify aphysics-based model of a multi-purpose commercial building including itsheating, ventilation and air conditioning system during regular operation. Wepresent our empirical results and show that large uncertainties in internalheat gains, due to occupancy and equipment, present several challenges inutilizing the building model for long-term prediction. In addition, we showthat by learning these uncertain loads online and dynamically updating thebuilding model, prediction accuracy is improved significantly.

Secure State Estimation for Nonlinear Power Systems under Cyber Attacks

  This paper focuses on securely estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamicalsystem from a set of corrupted measurements. In particular, we consider twobroad classes of nonlinear systems, and propose a technique which enables us toperform secure state estimation for such nonlinear systems. We then provideguarantees on the achievable state estimation error against arbitrarycorruptions, and analytically characterize the number of errors that can beperfectly corrected by a decoder. To illustrate how the proposed nonlinearestimation approach can be applied to practical systems, we focus on secureestimation for the wide area control of an interconnected power system undercyber-physical attacks and communication failures, and propose a secureestimator for the power system. Finally, we numerically show that the proposedsecure estimation algorithm enables us to reconstruct the attack signalsaccurately.

On the Powerball Method for Optimization

  We propose a new method to accelerate the convergence of optimizationalgorithms. This method simply adds a power coefficient $\gamma\in[0,1)$ to thegradient during optimization. We call this the Powerball method and analyze theconvergence rate for the Powerball method for strongly convex functions. Whiletheoretically the Powerball method is guaranteed to have a linear convergencerate in the same order of the gradient method, we show that empirically itsignificantly outperforms the gradient descent and Newton's method, especiallyduring the initial iterations. We demonstrate that the Powerball methodprovides a $10$-fold speedup of the convergence of both gradient descent andL-BFGS on multiple real datasets.

Secure Estimation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles against Adversarial Cyber  Attacks

  In the coming years, usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is expected togrow tremendously. Maintaining security of UAVs under cyber attacks is animportant yet challenging task, as these attacks are often erratic anddifficult to predict. Secure estimation problems study how to estimate thestates of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and maliciously corruptedsensor measurements. The fewer assumptions that an estimator makes about theattacker, the larger the set of attacks it can protect the system against. Inthis paper, we focus on sensor attacks on UAVs and attempt to design a secureestimator for linear time-invariant systems based on as few assumptions aboutthe attackers as possible. We propose a computationally efficient estimatorthat protects the system against arbitrary and unbounded attacks, where the setof attacked sensors can also change over time. In addition, we propose tocombine our secure estimator with a Kalman Filter for improved practicalperformance and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations of twoscenarios where an UAV is under adversarial cyber attack.

Plug-and-Play Model Predictive Control for Load Shaping and Voltage  Control in Smart Grids

  This paper presents a predictive controller for handling plug-and-play (P&P)charging requests of flexible loads in a distribution system. We define twotypes of flexible loads: (i) deferrable loads that have a fixed power profilebut can be deferred in time and (ii) shapeable loads that have flexible powerprofiles but fixed energy requests, such as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs).The proposed method uses a hierarchical control scheme based on a modelpredictive control (MPC) formulation for minimizing the global system cost. Thefirst stage computes a reachable reference that trades off deviation from thenominal voltage with the required generation control. The second stage uses aprice-based objective to aggregate flexible loads and provide load shapingservices, while satisfying system constraints and users' preferences at alltimes. It is shown that the proposed controller is recursively feasible underspecific conditions, i.e. the flexible load demands are satisfied and busvoltages remain within the desired limits. Finally, the proposed scheme isillustrated on a 55 bus radial distribution network.

Stability Analysis of Wholesale Electricity Markets under Dynamic  Consumption Models and Real-Time Pricing

  This paper analyzes stability conditions for wholesale electricity marketsunder real-time retail pricing and realistic consumption models with memory,which explicitly take into account previous electricity prices and consumptionlevels. By passing on the current retail price of electricity from supplier toconsumer and feeding the observed consumption back to the supplier, aclosed-loop dynamical system for electricity prices and consumption ariseswhose stability is to be investigated. Under mild assumptions on the generationcost of electricity and consumers' backlog disutility functions, we show that,for consumer models with price memory only, market stability is achieved if theratio between the consumers' marginal backlog disutility and the suppliers'marginal cost of supply remains below a fixed threshold. Further, consumermodels with price and consumption memory can result in greater stabilityregions and faster convergence to the equilibrium compared to models with pricememory alone, if consumption deviations from nominal demand are adequatelypenalized.

Multiplayer Reach-Avoid Games via Pairwise Outcomes

  A multiplayer reach-avoid game is a differential game between an attackingteam with NA attackers and a defending team with ND defenders playing on acompact domain with obstacles. The attacking team aims to send M of the NAattackers to some target location, while the defending team aims to preventthat by capturing attackers or indefinitely delaying attackers from reachingthe target. Although the analysis of this game plays an important role in manyapplications, the optimal solution to this game is computationally intractablewhen NA>1 or ND>1. In this paper, we present two approaches for the NA=ND=1case to determine pairwise outcomes, and a graph theoretic maximum matchingapproach to merge these pairwise outcomes for an NA,ND>1 solution that providesguarantees on the performance of the defending team. We will show that thefour-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach allows for real-time updatesto the maximum matching, and that the two-dimensional "path defense" approachis considerably more scalable with the number of players while maintainingdefender performance guarantees.

Using Neural Networks to Compute Approximate and Guaranteed Feasible  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE Solutions

  To sidestep the curse of dimensionality when computing solutions toHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations (HJB PDE), we propose analgorithm that leverages a neural network to approximate the value function. Weshow that our final approximation of the value function generates near optimalcontrols which are guaranteed to successfully drive the system to a targetstate. Our framework is not dependent on state space discretization, leading toa significant reduction in computation time and space complexity in comparisonwith dynamic programming-based approaches. Using this grid-free approach alsoenables us to plan over longer time horizons with relatively little additionalcomputation overhead. Unlike many previous neural network HJB PDE approximatingformulations, our approximation is strictly conservative and hence anytrajectories we generate will be strictly feasible. For demonstration, wespecialize our new general framework to the Dubins car model and discuss howthe framework can be applied to other models with higher-dimensional statespaces.

Hedging Strategies for Load-Serving Entities in Wholesale Electricity  Markets

  Load-serving entities which procure electricity from the wholesaleelectricity market to service end-users face significant quantity and pricerisks due to the volatile nature of electricity demand and quasi-fixedresidential tariffs at which electricity is sold. This paper investigatesstrategies for load serving entities to hedge against such price risks.Specifically, we compute profit-maximizing portfolios of forward contract andcall options as a function of the uncertain aggregate user demand. We comparethe profit to the case of Demand Response, where users are offered monetaryincentives to temporarily reduce their consumption during periods of supplyshortages. Using smart meter data of residential customers in California, wesimulate optimal portfolios and derive conditions under which Demand Responseoutperforms call options and forward contracts.

How Peer Effects Influence Energy Consumption

  This paper analyzes the impact of peer effects on electricity consumption ofa network of rational, utility-maximizing users. Users derive utility fromconsuming electricity as well as consuming less energy than their neighbors.However, a disutility is incurred for consuming more than their neighbors. Tomaximize the profit of the load-serving entity that provides electricity tosuch users, we develop a two-stage game-theoretic model, where the entity setsthe prices in the first stage. In the second stage, consumers decide on theirdemand in response to the observed price set in the first stage so as tomaximize their utility. To this end, we derive theoretical statements underwhich such peer effects reduce aggregate user consumption. Further, we obtainexpressions for the resulting electricity consumption and profit of the loadserving entity for the case of perfect price discrimination and a single priceunder complete information, and approximations under incomplete information.Simulations suggest that exposing only a selected subset of all users to peereffects maximizes the entity's profit.

FaSTrack: a Modular Framework for Fast and Guaranteed Safe Motion  Planning

  Fast and safe navigation of dynamical systems through a priori unknowncluttered environments is vital to many applications of autonomous systems.However, trajectory planning for autonomous systems is computationallyintensive, often requiring simplified dynamics that sacrifice safety anddynamic feasibility in order to plan efficiently. Conversely, safe trajectoriescan be computed using more sophisticated dynamic models, but this is typicallytoo slow to be used for real-time planning. We propose a new algorithmFaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking for High Dimensional systems. A path ortrajectory planner using simplified dynamics to plan quickly can beincorporated into the FaSTrack framework, which provides a safety controllerfor the vehicle along with a guaranteed tracking error bound. This boundcaptures all possible deviations due to high dimensional dynamics and externaldisturbances. Note that FaSTrack is modular and can be used with most currentpath or trajectory planners. We demonstrate this framework using a 10Dnonlinear quadrotor model tracking a 3D path obtained from an RRT planner.

A Hybrid Framework for Multi-Vehicle Collision Avoidance

  With the recent surge of interest in UAVs for civilian services, theimportance of developing tractable multi-agent analysis techniques that providesafety and performance guarantees have drastically increased. Hamilton-Jacobi(HJ) reachability has successfully provided these guarantees to small-scalesystems and is flexible in terms of system dynamics. However, the exponentialcomplexity scaling of HJ reachability with respect to system dimension preventsits direct application to larger-scale problems where the number of vehicles isgreater than two. In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance algorithmusing a hybrid framework for N+1 vehicles through higher-level control logicgiven any N-vehicle collision avoidance algorithm. Our algorithm conservativelyapproximates a guaranteed-safe region in the joint state space of the N+1vehicles and produces a safety-preserving controller. In addition, ouralgorithm does not incur significant additional computation cost. Wedemonstrate our proposed method in simulation.

Goal-Driven Dynamics Learning via Bayesian Optimization

  Real-world robots are becoming increasingly complex and commonly act inpoorly understood environments where it is extremely challenging to model orlearn their true dynamics. Therefore, it might be desirable to take atask-specific approach, wherein the focus is on explicitly learning thedynamics model which achieves the best control performance for the task athand, rather than learning the true dynamics. In this work, we use Bayesianoptimization in an active learning framework where a locally linear dynamicsmodel is learned with the intent of maximizing the control performance, andused in conjunction with optimal control schemes to efficiently design acontroller for a given task. This model is updated directly based on theperformance observed in experiments on the physical system in an iterativemanner until a desired performance is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy ofthe proposed approach through simulations and real experiments on a quadrotortestbed.

Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability: A Brief Overview and Recent Advances

  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is an important formalverification method for guaranteeing performance and safety properties ofdynamical systems; it has been applied to many small-scale systems in the pastdecade. Its advantages include compatibility with general nonlinear systemdynamics, formal treatment of bounded disturbances, and the availability ofwell-developed numerical tools. The main challenge is addressing itsexponential computational complexity with respect to the number of statevariables. In this tutorial, we present an overview of basic HJ reachabilitytheory and provide instructions for using the most recent numerical tools,including an efficient GPU-parallelized implementation of a Level Set Toolboxfor computing reachable sets. In addition, we review some of the current workin high-dimensional HJ reachability to show how the dimensionality challengecan be alleviated via various general theoretical and application-specificinsights.

Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Residential Demand  Response

  We evaluate the causal effect of hour-ahead price interventions on thereduction in residential electricity consumption using a data set from alarge-scale experiment on 7,000 households in California. By estimatinguser-level counterfactuals using time-series prediction, we estimate an averagetreatment effect of ~0.10 kWh (11%) per intervention and household. Next, weleverage causal decision trees to detect treatment effect heterogeneity acrossusers by incorporating census data. These decision trees depart fromclassification and regression trees, as we intend to estimate a causal effectbetween treated and control units rather than perform outcome regression. Wecompare the performance of causal decision trees with a simpler, yet moreinaccurate k-means clustering approach that naively detects heterogeneity inthe feature space, confirming the superiority of causal decision trees. Lastly,we comment on how our methods to detect heterogeneity can be used for targetinghouseholds to improve cost efficiency.

Planning, Fast and Slow: A Framework for Adaptive Real-Time Safe  Trajectory Planning

  Motion planning is an extremely well-studied problem in the roboticscommunity, yet existing work largely falls into one of two categories:computationally efficient but with few if any safety guarantees, or able togive stronger guarantees but at high computational cost. This work builds on arecent development called FaSTrack in which a slow offline computation providesa modular safety guarantee for a faster online planner. We introduce the notionof "meta-planning" in which a refined offline computation enables safeswitching between different online planners. This provides autonomous systemswith the ability to adapt motion plans to a priori unknown environments inreal-time as sensor measurements detect new obstacles, and the flexibility tomaneuver differently in the presence of obstacles than they would in freespace, all while maintaining a strict safety guarantee. We demonstrate themeta-planning algorithm both in simulation and in hardware using a smallCrazyflie 2.0 quadrotor.

Budget-Constrained Multi-Armed Bandits with Multiple Plays

  We study the multi-armed bandit problem with multiple plays and a budgetconstraint for both the stochastic and the adversarial setting. At each round,exactly $K$ out of $N$ possible arms have to be played (with $1\leq K \leq N$).In addition to observing the individual rewards for each arm played, the playeralso learns a vector of costs which has to be covered with an a-priori definedbudget $B$. The game ends when the sum of current costs associated with theplayed arms exceeds the remaining budget.  Firstly, we analyze this setting for the stochastic case, for which we assumeeach arm to have an underlying cost and reward distribution with support$[c_{\min}, 1]$ and $[0, 1]$, respectively. We derive an Upper Confidence Bound(UCB) algorithm which achieves $O(NK^4 \log B)$ regret.  Secondly, for the adversarial case in which the entire sequence of rewardsand costs is fixed in advance, we derive an upper bound on the regret of order$O(\sqrt{NB\log(N/K)})$ utilizing an extension of the well-known$\texttt{Exp3}$ algorithm. We also provide upper bounds that hold with highprobability and a lower bound of order $\Omega((1 - K/N)^2 \sqrt{NB/K})$.

Context-Specific Validation of Data-Driven Models

  With an increasing use of data-driven models to control robotic systems, ithas become important to develop a methodology for validating such models beforethey can be deployed to design a controller for the actual system.Specifically, it must be ensured that the controller designed for a learnedmodel would perform as expected on the actual physical system. We propose acontext-specific validation framework to quantify the quality of a learnedmodel based on a distance measure between the closed-loop actual system and thelearned model. We then propose an active sampling scheme to compute aprobabilistic upper bound on this distance in a sample-efficient manner. Theproposed framework validates the learned model against only those behaviors ofthe system that are relevant for the purpose for which we intend to use thismodel, and does not require any a priori knowledge of the system dynamics.Several simulations illustrate the practicality of the proposed framework forvalidating the models of real-world systems, and consequently, for controllersynthesis.

Classification-based Approximate Reachability with Guarantees Applied to  Safe Trajectory Tracking

  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has been developed over the pastdecades into a widely-applicable tool for determining goal satisfaction andsafety verification in nonlinear systems. While HJ reachability can beformulated very generally, computational complexity can be a serious impedimentfor many systems of practical interest. Much prior work has been devoted tocomputing approximate solutions to large reachability problems, yet many ofthese methods apply to only restricted problem classes, do not generatecontrollers, and/or are extremely conservative. In this paper, we present anovel approach to approximate HJ reachability in which computing an optimalcontroller is viewed as a sequential classification problem. Even though weemploy neural networks for this classification task, our method still providessafety guarantees in many cases. We demonstrate the utility of our approach inthe context of safe trajectory following with specific application to quadrotornavigation. Offline computation and online evaluation confirm that our methodpreserves safety.

Probabilistically Safe Robot Planning with Confidence-Based Human  Predictions

  In order to safely operate around humans, robots can employ predictive modelsof human motion. Unfortunately, these models cannot capture the full complexityof human behavior and necessarily introduce simplifying assumptions. As aresult, predictions may degrade whenever the observed human behavior departsfrom the assumed structure, which can have negative implications for safety. Inthis paper, we observe that how "rational" human actions appear under aparticular model can be viewed as an indicator of that model's ability todescribe the human's current motion. By reasoning about this model confidencein a real-time Bayesian framework, we show that the robot can very quicklymodulate its predictions to become more uncertain when the model performspoorly. Building on recent work in provably-safe trajectory planning, weleverage these confidence-aware human motion predictions to generate assuredautonomous robot motion. Our new analysis combines worst-case tracking errorguarantees for the physical robot with probabilistic time-varying humanpredictions, yielding a quantitative, probabilistic safety certificate. Wedemonstrate our approach with a quadcopter navigating around a human.

A Minimum Discounted Reward Hamilton-Jacobi Formulation for Computing  Reachable Sets

  We propose a novel formulation for approximating reachable sets through aminimum discounted reward optimal control problem. The formulation yields acontinuous solution that can be obtained by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.Furthermore, the numerical approximation to this solution can be obtained asthe unique fixed-point to a contraction mapping. This allows for more efficientsolution methods that could not be applied under traditional formulations forsolving reachable sets. In addition, this formulation provides a link betweenreinforcement learning and learning reachable sets for systems with unknowndynamics, allowing algorithms from the former to be applied to the latter. Weuse two benchmark examples, double integrator, and pursuit-evasion games, toshow the correctness of the formulation as well as its strengths in comparisonto previous work.

A Scalable Framework For Real-Time Multi-Robot, Multi-Human Collision  Avoidance

  Robust motion planning is a well-studied problem in the robotics literature,yet current algorithms struggle to operate scalably and safely in the presenceof other moving agents, such as humans. This paper introduces a novel frameworkfor robot navigation that accounts for high-order system dynamics and maintainssafety in the presence of external disturbances, other robots, andnon-deterministic intentional agents. Our approach precomputes a tracking errormargin for each robot, generates confidence-aware human motion predictions, andcoordinates multiple robots with a sequential priority ordering, effectivelyenabling scalable safe trajectory planning and execution. We demonstrate ourapproach in hardware with two robots and two humans. We also showcase ourwork's scalability in a larger simulation.

Safely Probabilistically Complete Real-Time Planning and Exploration in  Unknown Environments

  We present a new framework for motion planning that wraps around existingkinodynamic planners and guarantees recursive feasibility when operating in apriori unknown, static environments. Our approach makes strong guarantees aboutoverall safety and collision avoidance by utilizing a robust controller derivedfrom reachability analysis. We ensure that motion plans never exit the safebackward reachable set of the initial state, while safely exploring the space.This preserves the safety of the initial state, and guarantees that that wewill eventually find the goal if it is possible to do so while exploringsafely. We implement our framework in the Robot Operating System (ROS) softwareenvironment and demonstrate it in a real-time simulation.

Identification of Parameters and Initial Values for Reaction-Diffusion  Systems in Protein Networks (Extended Version)

  Spatio-temporal biochemical signaling in a large class of protein-proteininteraction networks is well modeled by a reaction-diffusion system. The globalexistence of the solution to the reaction-diffusion system is determined by thereaction kinetics model and the protein network topology. We propose a novelreaction kinetics model that guarantees that the reaction-diffusion system withthis model has a nonnegative invariant global classical solution for anynetwork topology. We then present a computational method to identify theunknown parameters and initial values for a reaction-diffusion system with thisreaction kinetics model. The identification approach solves an optimizationproblem that minimizes the cost function defined as the $L^2$-norm of thedifference between the data and the solution of the reaction-diffusion system.We utilize an adjoint-based optimal control method to obtain the gradients ofthe cost function with respect to the parameters and initial values. Theregularity of the global classical solutions of the reaction-diffusion systemand its corresponding adjoint system avoids situations in which the gradientsblow up, and therefore guarantees the success of the identification method forany network structure. Utilizing this gradient information, an efficientalgorithm to solve the optimization problem is proposed and applied to estimatethe mass diffusivities, rate constants and initial values of areaction-diffusion system that models protein-protein interactions in asignaling network that regulates the actin cytoskeleton in a malignant breastcell.

Risk-Limiting Dynamic Contracts for Direct Load Control

  This paper proposes a novel continuous-time dynamic contract framework thathas a risk-limiting capability. If a principal and an agent enter into such acontract, the principal can optimally manage its performance and risk with aguarantee that the agent's risk is less than or equal to a pre-specified leveland that the agent's expected payoff is greater than or equal to anotherpre-specified threshold. We achieve such risk-management capabilities byformulating the contract design problem as mean-variance constrainedrisk-sensitive control. A dynamic programming-based method is developed tosolve the problem. The key idea of our proposed solution method is toreformulate the inequality constraints on the mean and the variance of theagent's payoff as dynamical system constraints by introducing new state andcontrol variables. The reformulations use the martingale representationtheorem. The proposed contract method enables us to develop a new direct loadcontrol method that provides the load-serving entity with financial riskmanagement solutions in real-time electricity markets. We also propose anapproximate decomposition of the optimal contract design problem for multiplecustomers into multiple low-dimensional contract problems for one customer.This allows the direct load control program to work with a large number ofcustomers without any scalability issues. Furthermore, the contract designprocedure can be completely parallelized. The performance and usefulness of theproposed contract method and its application to direct load control aredemonstrated using data on the electric energy consumption of customers inAustin, Texas as well as the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas'locational marginal price data.

Approximation Algorithms for Optimization of Combinatorial Dynamical  Systems

  This paper considers an optimization problem for a dynamical system whoseevolution depends on a collection of binary decision variables. We developscalable approximation algorithms with provable suboptimality bounds to providecomputationally tractable solution methods even when the dimension of thesystem and the number of the binary variables are large. The proposed methodemploys a linear approximation of the objective function such that theapproximate problem is defined over the feasible space of the binary decisionvariables, which is a discrete set. To define such a linear approximation, wepropose two different variation methods: one uses continuous relaxation of thediscrete space and the other uses convex combinations of the vector field andrunning payoff. The approximate problem is a 0-1 linear program, which can besolved by existing polynomial-time exact or approximation algorithms, and doesnot require the solution of the dynamical system. Furthermore, we characterizea sufficient condition ensuring the approximate solution has a provablesuboptimality bound. We show that this condition can be interpreted as theconcavity of the objective function. The performance and utility of theproposed algorithms are demonstrated with the ON/OFF control problems ofinterdependent refrigeration systems.

Safe Sequential Path Planning of Multi-Vehicle Systems via  Double-Obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs Variational Inequality

  We consider the problem of planning trajectories for a group of $N$ vehicles,each aiming to reach its own target set while avoiding danger zones of othervehicles. The analysis of problems like this is extremely importantpractically, especially given the growing interest in utilizing unmannedaircraft systems for civil purposes. The direct solution of this problem bysolving a single-obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) variational inequality(VI) is numerically intractable due to the exponential scaling of computationcomplexity with problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the single-obstacle HJI VIcannot directly handle situations in which vehicles do not have a commonscheduled arrival time. Instead, we perform sequential path planning byconsidering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles astime-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve adouble-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, definedas the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while stayingwithin a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of thedouble-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and theoptimal control for each vehicle. This is a first application of thedouble-obstacle HJI VI which can handle systems with time-varying dynamics,target sets, and state constraint sets, and results in computation complexitythat scales linearly, as opposed to exponentially, with the number of vehiclesin consideration.

Exact and Efficient Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability for Decoupled Systems

  Reachability analysis is important for studying optimal control problems anddifferential games, which are powerful theoretical tools for analyzing andmodeling many practical problems in robotics, aircraft control, among otherapplication areas. In reachability analysis, one is interested in computing thereachable set, defined as the set of states from which there exists a control,despite the worst disturbance, that can drive the system into a set of targetstates. The target states can be used to model either unsafe or desirableconfigurations, depending on the application. Many Hamilton-Jacobi formulationsallow the computation of reachable sets; however, due to the exponentialcomplexity scaling in computation time and space, problems involvingapproximately 5 dimensions become intractable. A number of methods that computean approximate solution exist in the literature, but these methods trade offcomplexity for optimality. In this paper, we eliminate complexity-optimalitytrade-offs for time-invariant decoupled systems using a decoupledHamilton-Jacobi formulation that enables the exact reconstruction of highdimensional solutions via low dimensional solutions of the decoupledsubsystems. Our formulation is compatible with existing numerical tools, and weshow the accuracy, computation benefits, and an application of our novelapproach using two numerical examples.

Safe Platooning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles via Reachability

  Recently, there has been immense interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) for civilian operations such as package delivery, firefighting, and fastdisaster response. As a result, UAV traffic management systems are needed tosupport potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the airspace, inorder to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met. Hamilton-Jacobi(HJ) reachability is a powerful framework for providing conditions under whichthese requirements can be met, and for synthesizing the optimal controller formeeting them. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, HJ reachability isonly tractable for a small number of vehicles if their set of maneuvers isunrestricted. In this paper, we define a platoon to be a group of UAVs in asingle-file formation. We model each vehicle as a hybrid system with modescorresponding to its role in the platoon, and specify the set of allowedmaneuvers in each mode to make the analysis tractable. We propose severalliveness controllers based on HJ reachability, and wrap a safety controller,also based on HJ reachability, around the liveness controllers. For a singlealtitude range, our approach guarantees safety for one safety breach; in theunlikely event of multiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed overmultiple altitude ranges. We demonstrate the satisfaction of liveness andsafety requirements through simulations of three common scenarios.

Multi-Vehicle Collision Avoidance via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability and  Mixed Integer Programming

  Multi-agent differential games are important and useful tools for analyzingmany practical problems. With the recent surge of interest in using UAVs forcivil purposes, the importance and urgency of developing tractable multi-agentanalysis techniques that provide safety and performance guarantees is at anall-time high. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability has successfully providedsafety guarantees to small-scale systems and is flexible in terms of systemdynamics. However, the exponential complexity scaling of HJ reachabilityprevents its direct application to large scale problems when the number ofvehicles is greater than two. In this paper, we overcome the scalabilitylimitations of HJ reachability by using a mixed integer program that exploitsthe properties of HJ solutions to provide higher-level control logic. Ourproposed method provides safety guarantee for three-vehicle systems -- apreviously intractable task for HJ reachability -- without incurringsignificant additional computation cost. Furthermore, our method is scalablebeyond three vehicles and performs significantly better by several metrics thanan extension of pairwise collision avoidance to multi-vehicle collisionavoidance. We demonstrate our proposed method in simulations.

Fast Reachable Set Approximations via State Decoupling Disturbances

  With the recent surge of interest in using robotics and automation for civilpurposes, providing safety and performance guarantees has become extremelyimportant. In the past, differential games have been successfully used for theanalysis of safety-critical systems. In particular, the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)formulation of differential games provides a flexible way to compute thereachable set, which can characterize the set of states which lead to eitherdesirable or undesirable configurations, depending on the application. While HJreachability is applicable to many small practical systems, the curse ofdimensionality prevents the direct application of HJ reachability to manylarger systems. To address computation complexity issues, various efficientcomputation methods in the literature have been developed for approximating orexactly computing the solution to HJ partial differential equations, but onlywhen the system dynamics are of specific forms. In this paper, we propose aflexible method to trade off optimality with computation complexity in HJreachability analysis. To achieve this, we propose to simplify system dynamicsby treating state variables as disturbances. We prove that the resultingapproximation is conservative in the desired direction, and demonstrate ourmethod using a four-dimensional plane model.

Model Comparison of a Data-Driven and a Physical Model for Simulating  HVAC Systems

  Commercial buildings are responsible for a large fraction of energyconsumption in developed countries, and therefore are targets of energyefficiency programs. Motivated by the large inherent thermal inertia ofbuildings, the power consumption can be flexibly scheduled without compromisingoccupant comfort. This temporal flexibility offers opportunities for theprovision of frequency regulation to support grid stability. To realize energysavings and frequency regulation, it is of prime importance to identify arealistic model for the temperature dynamics of a building. We identify a low-dimensional data-driven model and a high-dimensional physics- based model fordifferent spatial granularities and temporal seasons based on a case study ofan entire floor of Sutardja Dai Hall, an office building on the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley campus. A comparison of these contrasting models showsthat, despite the higher forecasting accuracy of the physics-based model, bothmodels perform almost equally well for energy efficient control. We concludethat the data-driven model is more amenable to controller design due to its lowcomplexity, and could serve as a substitution for highly complex physics- basedmodels with an insignificant loss of prediction accuracy for many applications.On the other hand, our physics-based approach is more suitable for modelingbuildings with finer spatial granularities.

Exact and Efficient Hamilton-Jacobi-based Guaranteed Safety Analysis via  System Decomposition

  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a method that provides rigorous analysesof the safety properties of dynamical systems. This method has beensuccessfully applied to many low-dimensional dynamical system models such ascoarse models of aircraft and quadrotors in order to provide safety guaranteesin potentially dangerous scenarios. These guarantees can be provided by thecomputation of a backward reachable set (BRS), which represents the set ofstates from which the system may be driven into violating safety propertiesdespite the system's best effort to remain safe. Unfortunately, HJ reachabilityis not practical for high-dimensional systems because the complexity of the BRScomputation scales exponentially with the number of state dimensions. Althoughnumerous approximation techniques are able to tractably provide conservativeestimates of the BRS, they often require restrictive assumptions about systemdynamics without providing an exact solution. In this paper we propose ageneral method for decomposing dynamical systems. Even when the resultingsubsystems are coupled, relatively high-dimensional BRSs that were previouslyintractable or expensive to compute can now be quickly and exactly computed inlower-dimensional subspaces. As a result, the curse of dimensionality isalleviated to a large degree without sacrificing optimality. We demonstrate ourtheoretical results through two numerical examples: a 3D Dubins Car model and a6D Acrobatic Quadrotor model.

Decomposition of Reachable Sets and Tubes for a Class of Nonlinear  Systems

  Reachability analysis provides formal guarantees for performance and safetyproperties of nonlinear control systems. Here, one aims to compute the backwardreachable set (BRS) or tube (BRT) -- the set of states from which the systemcan be driven into a target set at a particular time or within a time interval,respectively. The computational complexity of current approaches scalesexponentially, making application to high-dimensional systems intractable. Wepropose a technique that decomposes the dynamics of a general class ofnonlinear systems into subsystems which may be coupled through common states,controls, and disturbances. Despite this coupling, BRSs and BRTs can becomputed efficiently using our technique without incurring additionalapproximation errors and without the need for linearizing dynamics orapproximating sets as polytopes. Computations of BRSs and BRTs now becomeorders of magnitude faster, and for the first time BRSs and BRTs for manyhigh-dimensional nonlinear control systems can be computed using theHamilton-Jacobi (HJ) formulation. In situations involving bounded adversarialdisturbances, our proposed method can obtain slightly conservative results. Wedemonstrate our theory by numerically computing BRSs and BRTs using the HJformulation for several systems, including the 6D Acrobatic Quadrotor and the10D Near-Hover Quadrotor.

Robust Sequential Path Planning Under Disturbances and Adversarial  Intruder

  Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle path planning is an important andurgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspacein the near future. Although this problem has been studied in the past, therehas not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety forvehicles with general nonlinear dynamics while taking into account disturbancesand potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi(HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction andsafety under such scenarios, and has been successfully applied to manysmall-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in mostcases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to theexponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to systemdimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees HJ reachabilityprovides, and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priorityordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential pathplanning (SPP) scheme, vehicles reserve "space-time" portions in the airspace,and the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance,and optimality of the paths given the priority ordering. With a computationcomplexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances andan intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, SPP cantractably solve the multi-vehicle path planning problem for vehicles withgeneral nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting. We demonstrate our theory inrepresentative simulations.

Eliciting Private User Information for Residential Demand Response

  Residential Demand Response has emerged as a viable tool to alleviate supplyand demand imbalances of electricity, particularly during times when theelectric grid is strained due a shortage of supply. Demand Response providersbid reduction capacity into the wholesale electricity market by asking theircustomers under contract to temporarily reduce their consumption in exchangefor a monetary incentive. To contribute to the analysis of consumer behavior inresponse to such incentives, this paper formulates Demand Response as aMechanism Design problem, where a Demand Response Provider elicits privateinformation of its rational, profit-maximizing customers who derive positiveexpected utility by participating in reduction events. By designing anincentive compatible and individually rational mechanism to collect users'price elasticities of demand, the Demand Response provider can target the mostsusceptible users to incentives. We measure reductions by comparing thematerialized consumption to the projected consumption, which we model as the"10-in-10"-baseline, the regulatory standard set by the California IndependentSystem Operator. Due to the suboptimal performance of this baseline, we show,using consumption data of residential customers in California, that DemandResponse Providers receive payments for "virtual reductions", which exist dueto the inaccuracies of the baseline rather than actual reductions. Improvingthe accuracy of the baseline diminishes the contribution of these virtualreductions.

A General Safety Framework for Learning-Based Control in Uncertain  Robotic Systems

  The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivatestheir application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However,guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently anunresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. Wepropose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachabilitymethods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. Themethod exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guaranteeconstraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process.We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis asthe system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness whenappropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. Theresult is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenesonly when (a) the computed safety guarantees require it, or (b) confidence inthe computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We provetheoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysisand demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle.Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, thequadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradientreinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from astrong external disturbance introduced during flight.

Provably Safe and Robust Drone Routing via Sequential Path Planning: A  Case Study in San Francisco and the Bay Area

  Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle path planning is an important andurgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspacein the near future. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool foranalyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied toseveral small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachabilityto large scale systems is often intractable because of itsexponentially-scaling computation complexity with respect to system dimension,also known as the "curse of dimensionality". To overcome this problem, thesequential path planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities tovehicles, was previously proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to bedone with a linearly-scaling computation complexity. In this work, wedemonstrate the potential of SPP algorithm for large-scale systems. Inparticular, we simulate large-scale multi-vehicle systems in two differenturban environments, a city environment and a multi-city environment, and usethe SPP algorithm for trajectory planning. SPP is able to efficiently designcollision-free trajectories in both environments despite the presence ofdisturbances in vehicles' dynamics. To ensure a safe transition of vehicles totheir destinations, our method automatically allocates space-time reservationsto vehicles while accounting for the magnitude of disturbances such as wind ina provably safe way. Our simulation results show an intuitive multi-lanestructure in airspace, where the number of lanes and the distance between thelanes depend on the size of disturbances and other problem parameters.

Safe and Resilient Multi-vehicle Trajectory Planning Under Adversarial  Intruder

  Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle trajectory planning is an importantand urgent problem. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool foranalyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied toseveral small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachabilityto multi-vehicle trajectory planning is often intractable due to the "curse ofdimensionality." To overcome this problem, the sequential trajectory planning(STP) method, which assigns strict priorities to vehicles, was proposed, STPallows multi-vehicle trajectory planning to be done with a linearly-scalingcomputation complexity. However, if a vehicle not in the set of STP vehiclesenters the system, or even worse, if this vehicle is an adversarial intruder,the previous formulation requires the entire system to perform replanning, anintractable task for large-scale systems. In this paper, we make STP morepractical by providing a new algorithm where replanning is only needed only fora fixed number of vehicles, irrespective of the total number of STP vehicles.Moreover, this number is a design parameter, which can be chosen based on thecomputational resources available during run time. We demonstrate thisalgorithm in a representative simulation of an urban airspace environment.

Robust Tracking with Model Mismatch for Fast and Safe Planning: an SOS  Optimization Approach

  In the pursuit of real-time motion planning, a commonly adopted practice isto compute a trajectory by running a planning algorithm on a simplified,low-dimensional dynamical model, and then employ a feedback tracking controllerthat tracks such a trajectory by accounting for the full, high-dimensionalsystem dynamics. While this strategy of planning with model mismatch generallyyields fast computation times, there are no guarantees of dynamic feasibility,which hampers application to safety-critical systems. Building upon recent workthat addressed this problem through the lens of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)reachability, we devise an algorithmic framework whereby one computes, offline,for a pair of "planner" (i.e., low-dimensional) and "tracking" (i.e.,high-dimensional) models, a feedback tracking controller and associatedtracking bound. This bound is then used as a safety margin when generatingmotion plans via the low-dimensional model. Specifically, we harness thecomputational tool of sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to design a bilinearoptimization algorithm for the computation of the feedback tracking controllerand associated tracking bound. The algorithm is demonstrated via numericalexperiments, with an emphasis on investigating the trade-off between theincreased computational scalability afforded by SOS and its intrinsicconservativeness. Collectively, our results enable scaling the appealingstrategy of planning with model mismatch to systems that are beyond the reachof HJ analysis, while maintaining safety guarantees.

A New Simulation Metric to Determine Safe Environments and Controllers  for Systems with Unknown Dynamics

  We consider the problem of extracting safe environments and controllers forreach-avoid objectives for systems with known state and control spaces, butunknown dynamics. In a given environment, a common approach is to synthesize acontroller from an abstraction or a model of the system (potentially learnedfrom data). However, in many situations, the relationship between the dynamicsof the model and the \textit{actual system} is not known; and hence it isdifficult to provide safety guarantees for the system. In such cases, theStandard Simulation Metric (SSM), defined as the worst-case norm distancebetween the model and the system output trajectories, can be used to modify areach-avoid specification for the system into a more stringent specificationfor the abstraction. Nevertheless, the obtained distance, and hence themodified specification, can be quite conservative. This limits the set ofenvironments for which a safe controller can be obtained. We propose SPEC, aspecification-centric simulation metric, which overcomes these limitations bycomputing the distance using only the trajectories that violate thespecification for the system. We show that modifying a reach-avoidspecification with SPEC allows us to synthesize a safe controller for a largerset of environments compared to SSM. We also propose a probabilistic method tocompute SPEC for a general class of systems. Case studies using simulators forquadrotors and autonomous cars illustrate the advantages of the proposed metricfor determining safe environment sets and controllers.

A Risk-Sensitive Finite-Time Reachability Approach for Safety of  Stochastic Dynamic Systems

  A classic reachability problem for safety of dynamic systems is to computethe set of initial states from which the state trajectory is guaranteed to stayinside a given constraint set over a given time horizon. In this paper, weleverage existing theory of reachability analysis and risk measures to devise arisk-sensitive reachability approach for safety of stochastic dynamic systemsunder non-adversarial disturbances over a finite time horizon. Specifically, wefirst introduce the notion of a risk-sensitive safe set as a set of initialstates from which the risk of large constraint violations can be reduced to arequired level via a control policy, where risk is quantified using theConditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure. Second, we show how the computationof a risk-sensitive safe set can be reduced to the solution to a MarkovDecision Process (MDP), where cost is assessed according to CVaR. Third,leveraging this reduction, we devise a tractable algorithm to approximate arisk-sensitive safe set, and provide theoretical arguments about itscorrectness. Finally, we present a realistic example inspired from stormwatercatchment design to demonstrate the utility of risk-sensitive reachabilityanalysis. In particular, our approach allows a practitioner to tune the levelof risk sensitivity from worst-case (which is typical for Hamilton-Jacobireachability analysis) to risk-neutral (which is the case for stochasticreachability analysis).

Reachability-Based Safety Guarantees using Efficient Initializations

  Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability analysis is a powerful tool foranalyzing the safety of autonomous systems. This analysis is computationallyintensive and typically performed offline. Online, however, the autonomoussystem may experience changes in system dynamics, external disturbances, and/orthe surrounding environment, requiring updated safety guarantees. Rather thanrestarting the safety analysis, we propose a method of "warm-start"reachability, which uses a user-defined initialization (typically thepreviously computed solution). By starting with an HJI function that is closerto the solution than the standard initialization, convergence may take feweriterations.  In this paper we prove that warm-starting will result in guaranteedconservative solutions by over-approximating the states that must be avoided tomaintain safety. We additionally prove that for many common problemformulations, warm-starting will result in exact solutions.We demonstrate ourmethod on several illustrative examples with a double integrator, and also on amore practical example with a 10D quadcopter model that experiences changes inmass and disturbances and must update its safety guarantees accordingly. Wecompare our approach to standard reachability and a recently proposed"discounted" reachability method, and find for our examples that warm-startingis 1.6 times faster than standard and 6.2 times faster than (untuned)discounted reachability.
