Approaching Utopia: Strong Truthfulness and Externality-Resistant  Mechanisms

  We introduce and study strongly truthful mechanisms and their applications.We use strongly truthful mechanisms as a tool for implementation in undominatedstrategies for several problems,including the design of externality resistantauctions and a variant of multi-dimensional scheduling.

Integrality Gaps of Linear and Semi-definite Programming Relaxations for  Knapsack

  In this paper, we study the integrality gap of the Knapsack linear program inthe Sherali- Adams and Lasserre hierarchies. First, we show that an integralitygap of 2 - {\epsilon} persists up to a linear number of rounds ofSherali-Adams, despite the fact that Knapsack admits a fully polynomial timeapproximation scheme [27,33]. Second, we show that the Lasserre hierarchycloses the gap quickly. Specifically, after t rounds of Lasserre, theintegrality gap decreases to t/(t - 1). To the best of our knowledge, this isthe first positive result that uses more than a small number of rounds in theLasserre hierarchy. Our proof uses a decomposition theorem for the Lasserrehierarchy, which may be of independent interest.

A Simply Exponential Upper Bound on the Maximum Number of Stable  Matchings

  Stable matching is a classical combinatorial problem that has been thesubject of intense theoretical and empirical study since its introduction in1962 in a seminal paper by Gale and Shapley. In this paper, we provide a newupper bound on $f(n)$, the maximum number of stable matchings that a stablematching instance with $n$ men and $n$ women can have. It has been along-standing open problem to understand the asymptotic behavior of $f(n)$ as$n\to\infty$, first posed by Donald Knuth in the 1970s. Until now the bestlower bound was approximately $2.28^n$, and the best upper bound was $2^{n\logn- O(n)}$. In this paper, we show that for all $n$, $f(n) \leq c^n$ for someuniversal constant $c$. This matches the lower bound up to the base of theexponent. Our proof is based on a reduction to counting the number of downsetsof a family of posets that we call "mixing". The latter might be of independentinterest.

On Revenue Maximization in Second-Price Ad Auctions

  Most recent papers addressing the algorithmic problem of allocatingadvertisement space for keywords in sponsored search auctions assume thatpricing is done via a first-price auction, which does not realistically modelthe Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used in practice. Towards the goalof more realistically modeling these auctions, we introduce the Second-Price AdAuctions problem, in which bidders' payments are determined by the GSPmechanism. We show that the complexity of the Second-Price Ad Auctions problemis quite different than that of the more studied First-Price Ad Auctionsproblem. First, unlike the first-price variant, for which small constant-factorapproximations are known, it is NP-hard to approximate the Second-Price AdAuctions problem to any non-trivial factor. Second, this discrepancy extendseven to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching problem(2PM). In particular, offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is nodeterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and norandomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This standsin contrast to the results for the analogous special case in the first-pricemodel, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomialtime and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achievingbetter competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximationfor offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.The latter result makes use of a new generalization of a classic result on theperformance of the "Ranking" algorithm for online bipartite matching.

How to sell an app: pay-per-play or buy-it-now?

  We consider pricing in settings where a consumer discovers his value for agood only as he uses it, and the value evolves with each use. We explore simpleand natural pricing strategies for a seller in this setting, under theassumption that the seller knows the distribution from which the consumer'sinitial value is drawn, as well as the stochastic process that governs theevolution of the value with each use.  We consider the differences between up-front or "buy-it-now" pricing (BIN),and "pay-per-play" (PPP) pricing, where the consumer is charged per use. Ourresults show that PPP pricing can be a very effective mechanism for pricediscrimination, and thereby can increase seller revenue. But it can also beadvantageous to the buyers, as a way of mitigating risk. Indeed, thismitigation of risk can yield a larger pool of buyers. We also show that thepractice of offering free trials is largely beneficial.  We consider two different stochastic processes for how the buyer's valueevolves: In the first, the key random variable is how long the consumer remainsinterested in the product. In the second process, the consumer's value evolvesaccording to a random walk or Brownian motion with reflection at 1, andabsorption at 0.

Stability of Service under Time-of-Use Pricing

  We consider "time-of-use" pricing as a technique for matching supply anddemand of temporal resources with the goal of maximizing social welfare.Relevant examples include energy, computing resources on a cloud computingplatform, and charging stations for electric vehicles, among many others. Aclient/job in this setting has a window of time during which he needs service,and a particular value for obtaining it. We assume a stochastic model fordemand, where each job materializes with some probability via an independentBernoulli trial. Given a per-time-unit pricing of resources, any realized jobwill first try to get served by the cheapest available resource in its windowand, failing that, will try to find service at the next cheapest availableresource, and so on. Thus, the natural stochastic fluctuations in demand havethe potential to lead to cascading overload events. Our main result shows thatsetting prices so as to optimally handle the {\em expected} demand works well:with high probability, when the actual demand is instantiated, the system isstable and the expected value of the jobs served is very close to that of theoptimal offline algorithm.

Combinatorial Auctions with Interdependent Valuations: SOS to the Rescue

  We study combinatorial auctions with interdependent valuations. In suchsettings, each agent $i$ has a private signal $s_i$ that captures her privateinformation, and the valuation function of every agent depends on the entiresignal profile, ${\bs}=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$. Previous results in economicsconcentrated on identifying (often stringent) assumptions under which optimalsolutions can be attained. The computer science literature providedapproximation results for simple single-parameter settings (mostly single itemauctions, or matroid feasibility constraints). Both bodies of literatureconsidered only valuations satisfying a technical condition termed {\em singlecrossing} (or variants thereof). Indeed, without imposing assumptions on thevaluations, strong impossibility results exist.  We consider the class of {\em submodular over signals} (SOS) valuations(without imposing any single-crossing type assumption), and provide the firstwelfare approximation guarantees for multi-dimensional combinatorial auctions,achieved by universally ex-post IC-IR mechanisms. Our main results are: $(i)$4-approximation for any single-parameter downward-closed setting withsingle-dimensional signals and SOS valuations; $(ii)$ 4-approximation for anycombinatorial auction with multi-dimensional signals and {\em separable}-SOSvaluations; and $(iii)$ $(k+3)$- and $(2\log(k)+4)$-approximation for anycombinatorial auction with single-dimensional signals, with $k$-sized signalspace, for SOS and strong-SOS valuations, respectively. All of our resultsextend to a parameterized version of SOS, $d$-SOS, while losing a factor thatdepends on $d$.

Thinking Twice about Second-Price Ad Auctions

  Recent work has addressed the algorithmic problem of allocating advertisementspace for keywords in sponsored search auctions so as to maximize revenue, mostof which assume that pricing is done via a first-price auction. This does notrealistically model the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used inpractice, in which bidders pay the next-highest bid for keywords that they areallocated. Towards the goal of more realistically modeling these auctions, weintroduce the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem, in which bidders' payments aredetermined by the GSP mechanism. We show that the complexity of theSecond-Price Ad Auctions problem is quite different than that of the morestudied First-Price Ad Auctions problem. First, unlike the first-price variant,for which small constant-factor approximations are known, it is NP-hard toapproximate the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem to any non-trivial factor,even when the bids are small compared to the budgets. Second, this discrepancyextends even to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matchingproblem (2PM). Offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is nodeterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and norandomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. Thiscontrasts with the results for the analogous special case in the first-pricemodel, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomialtime and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achievingbetter competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximationfor offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.The latter result makes use of a new generalization of a result on theperformance of the "Ranking" algorithm for online bipartite matching.
