NeuroRule: A Connectionist Approach to Data Mining

  Classification, which involves finding rules that partition a given data setinto disjoint groups, is one class of data mining problems. Approaches proposedso far for mining classification rules for large databases are mainly decisiontree based symbolic learning methods. The connectionist approach based onneural networks has been thought not well suited for data mining. One of themajor reasons cited is that knowledge generated by neural networks is notexplicitly represented in the form of rules suitable for verification orinterpretation by humans. This paper examines this issue. With our newlydeveloped algorithms, rules which are similar to, or more concise than thosegenerated by the symbolic methods can be extracted from the neural networks.The data mining process using neural networks with the emphasis on ruleextraction is described. Experimental results and comparison with previouslypublished works are presented.

Fully Band Resolved Scattering Rate in MgB2 Revealed by Nonlinear Hall  Effect and Magnetoresistance Measurements

  We have measured the normal state temperature dependence of the Hall effectand magnetoresistance in epitaxial MgB2 thin films with variable disorderscharacterized by the residual resistance ratio RRR ranging from 4.0 to 33.3. Astrong nonlinearity of the Hall effect and magnetoresistance have been found inclean samples, and they decrease gradually with the increase of disorders ortemperature. By fitting the data to the theoretical model based on theBoltzmann equation and ab initio calculations for a four-band system, for thefirst time, we derived the scattering rates of these four bands at differenttemperatures and magnitude of disorders. Our method provides a unique way toderive these important parameters in multiband systems.

Soliton with a Pion Field in the Global Color Symmetry Model

  We calculate the property of the global color symmetry model soliton with thepion field being included explicitly. The calculated results indicate that thepion field provides a strong attraction so that the eigen-energy of a quark andthe mass of a soliton reduce drastically, in contrast to those with only thesigma field.

On the Phase Transition of Corrupted Sensing

  In \cite{FOY2014}, a sharp phase transition has been numerically observedwhen a constrained convex procedure is used to solve the corrupted sensingproblem. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis for this phenomenon.Specifically, we establish the threshold below which this convex procedurefails to recover signal and corruption with high probability. Together with thework in \cite{FOY2014}, we prove that a sharp phase transition occurs aroundthe sum of the squares of spherical Gaussian widths of two tangent cones.Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the correctness and sharpnessof our results.

I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films

  The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have beenstudied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0Hbetween 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-Visotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures showa scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortexglass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed downto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale interms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this maybe caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles.Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaledaccording to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalenteffect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

Scaling of Hall Resistivity in the Mixed State of MgB2 Films

  The longitudinal resistivity (rho_{xx}) and transverse resistivity (rho_{xy})of MgB2 thin films in the mixed state were studied in detail. We found that thetemperature dependencies of rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy} at a fixed magnetic field(H) satisfy the scaling law of $\rho_{xy}=A\rho_{xx}^\beta$, where the exponentbeta varies around 2.0 for different fields. In the low field region (below1T), beta maintains a constant value of 2.0 due to the weak pinning strength ofthe vortices, mainly from the superfluid of the pi band. When H>1T, beta dropsabruptly to its lowest value at about 2T because of the proliferation ofquasiparticles from the pi-band and, hence, the motion of the vortices from thesuperfluid of the sigma-band dominates the dissipation. As the field isincreased further, the vortex pinning strength is weakened and beta increasesmonotonically towards 2.0 at a high field. All the results presented here arein good agreement with the expectation of the vortex physics of a multi-bandsuperconductor.

Phase diagram of Kondo-Heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice with  geometrical frustration

  We calculated the phase diagram of the Kondo-Heisenberg model ontwo-dimensional honeycomb lattice with both nearest-neighbor andnext-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic spin exchanges, to investigate theinterplay between RKKY and Kondo interactions at presence of magneticfrustration. Within a mean-field decoupling technology in slave-fermionrepresentation, we derived the zero-temperature phase diagram as a function ofKondo coupling $J_k$ and frustration strength $Q$. The geometrical frustrationcan destroy the magnetic order, driving the original antiferromagnetic (AF)phase to non-magnetic valence bond state (VBS). In addition, we found twodistinct VBS. As $J_k$ is increased, a phase transition from AF to Kondoparamagnetic (KP) phase occurs, without the intermediate phase coexisting AForder with Kondo screening found in square lattice systems. In the KP phase,the enhancement of frustration weakens the Kondo screening effect, resulting ina phase transition from KP to VBS. We also found a process to recover the AForder from VBS by increasing $J_k$ in a wide range of frustration strength. Ourwork may provide deeper understanding for the phase transitions inheavy-fermion materials, particularly for those exhibiting triangularfrustration.

Magnetic and topological transitions in three-dimensional topological  Kondo insulator

  By using an extended slave-boson method, we draw a global phase diagramsummarizing both magnetic phases and paramagnetic (PM) topological insulatingphases (TI$_s$) in three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator (TKI). Byincluding electron hopping (EH) up to third neighbor, we identify four strongtopological insulating (STI) phases and two weak topological insulating (WTI)phases, then the PM phase diagrams characterizing topological transitionsbetween these TI$_s$ are depicted as functions of EH, $f$-electron energy leveland hybridization constant. We also find an insulator-metal transition from aSTI phase which has surface Fermi rings and spin textures in qualitativeagreement to TKI candidate SmB$_6$. In weak hybridization regime,antiferromagnetic (AF) order naturally arises in the phase diagrams, anddepending on how the magnetic boundary crosses the PM topological transitionlines, AF phases are classified into AF topological insulator (AFTI) andnon-topological AF insulator (nAFI), according to their $\mathcal{Z}_2$indices. In two small regions of parameter space, two distinct topologicaltransition processes between AF phases occur, leading to two types of AFTI,showing distinguishable surface dispersions around their Dirac points.

Investigating Thermal Cooling Mechanisms of Human Body Under Exposure to  Electromagnetic Radiation

  Thermal cooling mechanisms of human exposed to electromagnetic (EM) radiationare studied in detail. The electromagnetic and thermal co-simulation method isutilized to calculate the electromagnetic and temperature distributions.Moreover, Pennes' bioheat equation is solved to understand different thermalcooling mechanisms including blood flow, convective cooling and radiativecooling separately or jointly. Numerical results demonstrate thecharacteristics and functions for each cooling mechanism. Different from thetraditional view that the cooling effect of blood is usually reflected by itsinfluence on sweat secretion and evaporation, our study indicates that theblood flow itself is an important factor of thermal cooling especially forhigh-intensity EM radiation. This work contributes to fundamental understandingof thermal cooling mechanisms of human.

Dose conversion coefficients for Chinese reference adult male and female  voxel phantoms from idealized neutron exposures

  A new set of fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients based on the Chinesereference adult voxel phantoms CRAM and CRAF are presented for six idealizedexternal neutron exposures from 10-8 MeV to 20 MeV. The voxel phantoms CRAM andCRAF were adjusted from the previous phantoms CNMAN and CNWM respectively, andthe masses of individual organs have been adjusted to the Chinese referencedata. The calculation of organ-absorbed doses and effective doses wereperformed with the Monte Carlo transport code MCNPX. The resulting doseconversion coefficients were compared with those published in ICRP Publication116, which represents the reference Caucasian. The organ-absorbed doseconversion coefficients of most organs are in good agreement with the resultsin ICRP Publication 116, however, obvious discrepancies are observed for someorgans and certain geometries. For neutrons with energies above 2 MeV, theeffective dose conversion coefficients of Chinese reference adult are almostidentical to those of ICRP Publication 116 in AP, PA, ROT and ISO geometries.When energies range from 10-8 MeV to 1 MeV, differences are within 10% in AP(5%), PA (8%) and ROT (-4%) geometries. However, relatively large discrepanciesare shown in lateral and ISO geometries when energies are below 1 MeV, withdifferences of -15% for LLAT, -20% for RLAT and -12% for ISO, respectively.

Application of Hilbert-Huang decomposition to reduce noise and  characterize for NMR FID signal of proton precession magnetometer

  The parameters in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) free induction decay(FID) signal contain information that is useful in magnetic field measurement,magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) and other related applications. A real timesampled FID signal is well modeled as a finite mixture of exponential sequencesplus noise. We propose to use the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) for noisereduction and characterization, where the generalized Hilbert-Huang representsa way to decompose a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF) alongwith a trend, and obtain instantaneous frequency data. Moreover, the HHT for anFID signal's feature analysis is applied for the first time. First, acquiringthe actual untuned FID signal by a developed prototype of proton magnetometer,and then the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is performed to decompose thenoise and original FID. Finally, the HHT is applied to the obtained IMFs toextract the Hilbert energy spectrum, to indicate the energy distribution of thesignal on the frequency axis. By theory analysis and the testing of an actualFID signal, the results show that, compared with general noise reductionmethods such as auto correlation and singular value decomposition (SVD),combined with the proposed method can further suppress the interfered signalseffectively, and can obtain different components of FID signal, which can useto identify the magnetic anomaly, the existence of groundwater etc. This is avery important property since it can be exploited to separate the FID signalfrom noise and to estimate exponential sequence parameters of FID signal.

Coherent andstrong photon-phonon interaction is manifested with optomechanically inducedtransparency and absorption, and phase-coherent interaction in multiplecavities. Inside an echo chamber it is shown that a phonon pulse can interactwith an embedded nanocavity for multiple times. Our device provides a scalableplatform to optomechanically couple phonons and photons for microwave photonicsand quantum photonics.

Spin filtering in transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules from first  principles

  Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory andthe nonequilibrium Green function formalism, we studied the spin transportthrough metal-phthalocyanine (MPc, M=Ni, Fe, Co, Mn, Cr) molecules connected toaurum nanowire electrodes. We found that the MnPc, FePc, and CrPc moleculardevices exhibit a perfect spin filtering effect compared to CoPc and NiPc.Moreover, negative differential resistance appears in FePc molecular devices.The transmission coefficients at different bias voltages were further presentedto understand this phenomenon. These results would be useful in designingdevices for future nanotechnology.

Heroes and Zeroes: Predicting the Impact of New Video Games on Twitch.tv

  Video games and the playing thereof have been a fixture of American culturesince their introduction in the arcades of the 1980s. However, it was not untilthe recent proliferation of broadband connections robust and fast enough tohandle live video streaming that players of video games have transitioned froma content consumer role to a content producer role. Simultaneously, the rise ofsocial media has revealed how interpersonal connections drive user engagementand interest. In this work, we discuss the recent proliferation of video gamestreaming, particularly on Twitch.tv, analyze trends and patterns in video gameviewing, and develop predictive models for determining if a new game will havesubstantial impact on the streaming ecosystem.

Thermal rectification and heat amplification in a nonequilibrium V-type  three-level system

  Thermal rectification and heat amplification are investigated in anonequilibrium V-type three-level system with quantum interference. By applyingthe Redfield master equation combined with full counting statistics, we analyzethe steady state heat transport. The noise-induced interference is found to beable to rectify the heat current, which paves a new way to design quantumthermal rectifier. Within the three-reservoir setup, the heat amplification isclearly identified far-from equilibrium, which is in absence of the negativedifferential thermal conductance.

Variation of a Signal in Schwarzschild Spacetime

  In this paper, the variation of a signal in Schwarzschild spacetime isstudied and a general equation for frequency shift parameter (FSP) ispresented. It shows that FSP depends on the gravitationally-modified Dopplereffects and the gravitational effects of observers. In addition, rates of timeof a transmitter and a receiver may be different. When FSP is a function of thetime of a receiver, FSP contributed by gravitational effect (GFSP) orgravitationally-modified Doppler effect (GMDFSP) may lead a bandlimited signalto a non-bandlimited signal. Based on the equation, FSP as a function of thetime of a receiver is calculated for three scenarios: a) a spaceship moves awayfrom a star with a constant velocity communicating with a transmitter at afixed position; b) a spaceship moves around a star with different conictrajectories communicating with a transmitter at a fixed position; c) a signalis transmitted at a fixed position in a star system to a receiver moving withan elliptical trajectory in another star system. The studied stars are sun-likestar, white dwarf and neutron star, and some numerical examples are presentedto illustrate the theory.

Data-driven physics informed deep learning of solute transport with  anomalous diffusion

  The fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) has attracted increasedattention from researchers as it provides an accurate description forchallenging phenomenas with long-range time memory and spatial interactions,such as the anomalous diffusion behavior in the solute transport in porousmedia. Practically, a full characterization of the model parameters, such asthe fluid velocity, dispersion coefficient and the order of the fractionalderivative, often implies a huge amount of experiments and measurements andthus are hard to be determined. In this paper, we employ the framework offeedforward deep neural networks (DNNs) to develop an efficient data-drivendeep learning algorithm for inferring the aforementioned parameters of theFADE, such as the time-dependent space-fractional advection-dispersion equation(sFADE) and the variable-order fractional mobile/immobile equation (VoFMIE), inwhich the feedforward DNNs are trained to minimize the mean square error lossfunction formulated by means of the finite difference approximations of sFADEand VoFMIE, respectively. Several numerical experiments, in which we discoverthe model parameters by the feedforward DNNs for both the synthetic and fielddata, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of theproposed data-driven deep learning algorithm.

Multi-band superconductivity and possible nodal gap in  RbCr$_{3}$As$_{3}$ revealed by Andreev reflection and single-particle  tunneling measurements

  By measuring point-contact Andreev reflection spectra in the newly discoveredchromium-based quasi-one-dimensional superconductor RbCr$_{3}$As$_{3}$, we findclear evidence of two superconducting components, one has a gap value of about1.8 meV and another about 5 meV. Detailed analysis finds that the larger gappossesses an $s$-wave nature, but the smaller gap exhibits a sharp peak featurenear zero energy on the Andreev reflection spectrum manifesting a possiblenodal gap. We then carry out the single-particle tunneling measurements basedon a scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) by using the needle-like sample asthe tip, and in this case the measuring current is parallel to the $k_z$ or[(Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$)$^{-}$]$_\infty$-chain direction. The single-particletunneling spectra show only one gap feature with the gap value of about 1.8meV. Fitting to the single particle tunneling spectra tells that the gap shouldhave a large anisotropy or even node(s). We argue that the smaller gap may bemainly contributed by the hybridized Fermi surface with a large weight comingfrom the quasi-1D bands. Therefore our results from combinatorial experimentsof Andreev reflection and STS are consistent with the theoretical predictionsfor multi-band superconductivity and a possible $p$-wave superconducting gapalong the [(Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$)$^{-}$]$_\infty$-chain direction.

On the Anisotropy of Nuclei Mid-Infrared Radiation in Nearby Active  Galactic Nuclei

  In the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the dusty torus absorb theradiation from the central engine and re-emit in mid-infrared (MIR).Observations have detected moderate anisotropy in the dust MIR emission, in theway that type 1 AGNs (type1s) are mildly brighter in MIR comparing with type 2sources (type2s). However, type1s and type2s were found to follow statisticallythe same tight MIR -- hard X-ray correlation, suggesting the MIR emission ishighly isotropic assuming the hard X-ray radiation is inclination independent.We argue this discrepancy could be solved considering the hard X-ray emissionin AGN is also mildly anisotropic as we recently discovered. To verify thisdiagram, we compare the sub-arcsecond 12\mu m flux densities of type1s andtype2s using [OIV]$\lambda$25.89\mu m emission line as an isotropic luminosityindicator. We find that on average type1s are brighter in nuclei 12\mu mradiation by a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.6$ than type2s at given[OIV]$\lambda$25.89\mu m luminosities, confirming the mild anisotropy of thenuclei 12\mu m emission. We show that the anisotropy of the 12\mu m emission wedetected is in good agreement with radiative transfer models of clumpy torus.The fact that type 1 and type 2 AGNs follow the same tight MIR -- hard X-raycorrelation instead supports that both the MIR and hard X-ray emission in AGNsare mildly anisotropic.

Phase evolution of the two-dimensional Kondo lattice model near  half-filling

  Within a mean-field approximation, the ground state and finite temperaturephase diagrams of the two-dimensional Kondo lattice model have been carefullystudied as functions of the Kondo coupling $J$ and the conduction electronconcentration $n_{c}$. In addition to the conventional hybridization betweenlocal moments and itinerant electrons, a staggered hybridization is proposed tocharacterize the interplay between the antiferromagnetism and the Kondoscreening effect. As a result, a heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase isobtained and separated from the pure antiferromagnetic ordered phase by afirst-order Lifshitz phase transition, while a continuous phase transitionexists between the heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondoparamagnetic phase. We have developed a efficient theory to calculate thesephase boundaries. As $n_{c}$ decreases from the half-filling, the region of theheavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase shrinks and finally disappears at acritical point $n_{c}^{*}=0.8228$, leaving a first-order critical line betweenthe pure antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondo paramagnetic phase for$n_{c}<n_{c}^{* }$. At half-filling limit, a finite temperature phase diagramis also determined on the Kondo coupling and temperature ($J$-$T$) plane.Notably, as the temperature is increased, the region of the heavy fermionantiferromagnetic phase is reduced continuously, and finally converges to asingle point, together with the pure antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondoparamagnetic phase. The phase diagrams with such triple point may account forthe observed phase transitions in related heavy fermion materials.

Atomically-thin Femtojoule Filamentary Memristor

  The morphology and dimension of the conductive filament formed in amemristive device are strongly influenced by the thickness of its switchingmedium layer. Aggressive scaling of this active layer thickness is criticaltowards reducing the operating current, voltage and energy consumption infilamentary type memristors. Previously, the thickness of this filament layerhas been limited to above a few nanometers due to processing constraints,making it challenging to further suppress the on-state current and theswitching voltage. Here, we study the formation of conductive filaments in amaterial medium with sub-nanometer thickness, formed through the oxidation ofatomically-thin two-dimensional boron nitride. The resulting memristive deviceexhibits sub-nanometer filamentary switching with sub-pA operation current andfemtojoule per bit energy consumption. Furthermore, by confining the filamentto the atomic scale, we observe current switching characteristics that aredistinct from that in thicker medium due to the profoundly different atomickinetics. The filament morphology in such an aggressively scaled memristivedevice is also theoretically explored. These ultra-low energy devices arepromising for realizing femtojoule and sub-femtojoule electronic computation,which can be attractive for applications in a wide range of electronics systemsthat desire ultra-low power operation.

Phase Transition of Convex Programs for Linear Inverse Problems with  Multiple Prior Constraints

  A sharp phase transition emerges in convex programs when solving the linearinverse problem, which aims to recover a structured signal from its linearmeasurements. This paper studies this phenomenon in theory under Gaussianrandom measurements. Different from previous studies, in this paper, weconsider convex programs with multiple prior constraints. These programs areencountered in many cases, for example, when the signal is sparse and its$\ell_2$ norm is known beforehand, or when the signal is sparse andnon-negative simultaneously. Given such a convex program, to analyze its phasetransition, we introduce a new set and a new cone, called the prior restrictedset and prior restricted cone, respectively. Our results reveal that the phasetransition of a convex problem occurs at the statistical dimension of its priorrestricted cone. Moreover, to apply our theoretical results in practice, wepresent two recipes to accurately estimate the statistical dimension of theprior restricted cone. These two recipes work under different conditions, andwe give a detailed analysis for them. To further illustrate our results, weapply our theoretical results and the estimation recipes to study the phasetransition of two specific problems, and obtain computable formulas for thestatistical dimension and related error bounds. Simulations are provided todemonstrate our results.

$\mathcal{Z}_2$ classification for a novel antiferromagnetic topological  insulating phase in three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator

  Antiferromagnetic topological insulator (AFTI) is a topological matter thatbreaks time-reversal symmetry. Since its proposal, explorations of AFTI instrong-correlated systems are still lacking. In this paper, we show for thefirst time that a novel AFTI phase can be realized in three-dimensionaltopological Kondo insulator (TKI). In a wide parameter region, the groundstates of TKI undergo a second-order transition to antiferromagnetic insulatingphases which conserve a combined symmetry of time reversal and a latticetranslation, allowing us to derive a $\mathcal{Z}_2$-classification formula forthese states. By calculating the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ index, the antiferromagneticinsulating states are classified into (AFTI) or non-topologicalantiferromagnetic insulator (nAFI) in different parameter regions. On theantiferromagnetic surfaces in AFTI, we find topologically protected gaplessDirac cones inside the bulk gap, leading to metallic Fermi rings exhibitinghelical spin texture with weak spin-momentum locking. Depending on modelparameters, the magnetic transitions take place either between AFTI and strongtopological insulator, or between nAFI and weak topological insulator. Byvarying some model parameters, we find a topological transition between AFTIand nAFI, driving by closing of bulk gap. Our work may account for thepressure-induced magnetism in TKI compound SmB$_6$, and helps to explore richerAFTI phases in heavy-fermion systems as well as in other strong-correlatedsystems.

Distribution of high-dimensional orbital angular momentum entanglement  at telecom wavelength over 1km OAM fiber

  High-dimensional entanglement has exhibited its massive potential inincreasing channel capacity and resistance to noise in quantum informationprocessing. However, its distribution is quite a challenging task, imposing asevere restriction on its application. Here we report the first distribution ofthree-dimensional orbital angular momentum(OAM) entanglement via a 1-km-lengthOAM fiber. Using an actively-stabilizing phase precompensation technique, wesuccessfully transport one photon of a three-dimensional OAM entangled photonpair through the fiber. The distributed OAM entangled state still shows afidelity up to 71% with respect to the three-dimensionalmaximal-entangled-state (MES). In addition, we certify that thehigh-dimensional quantum entanglement survives the transportation by employinggeneralized Bell inequality, obtaining a violation of ~3 standard deviationswith I3=2.12(0.04). The method we developed can be extended to higher OAMdimension and larger distance in principle. Our results make a significant steptowards future OAM-based high-dimensional long distance quantum communication.

Chemical Potential Dependence of Chiral Quark Condensate in  Dyson-Schwinger Equation Approach of QCD

  We propose a chemical potential dependent effective gluon propagator andstudy the chiral quark condensate in strongly interacting matter in theframework of Dyson-Schwinger equation approach. The obtained results manifestthat, as the effect of the chemical potential on the effective gluon propagatoris taken into account, the chiral quark condensate decreases gradually with theincreasing of the chemical potential if it is less than the critical value, andthe condensate vanishes suddenly at the critical chemical potential. Theinclusion of the chemical potential in the effective gluon propagator enhancesthe decreasing rate and decreases the critical chemical potential. It indicatesthat the chiral symmetry can be restored completely at a critical chemicalpotential and restored partially as the chemical potential is less than thecritical value. If the effective gluon propagator is independent of thechemical potential, the chiral symmetry can only be restored suddenly but nogradual restoration.

Dyson-Schwinger Equation and Quantum Phase Transitions in Massless QCD

  We study the stability of the highest symmetric solution (Wigner-solution) ofDyson-Schwinger equations in chiral limit and at zero temperature. Our resultsconfirm that if the chemical potential is not very large, the QCD vacuum is inthe chiral symmetry breaking phase and the quantum phase-transition of thechiral symmetry restoration is in first order. Meanwhile it seems that there isnot competition between chiral symmetry breaking phase and colorsuperconductivity phase since the color superconductivity phase appears only ifthe chemical potential is very large. Moreover, we propose that chiral symmetrybreaking arises from the positive feedback with respect to the massperturbation.

Exact Subspace Segmentation and Outlier Detection by Low-Rank  Representation

  In this work, we address the following matrix recovery problem: suppose weare given a set of data points containing two parts, one part consists ofsamples drawn from a union of multiple subspaces and the other part consists ofoutliers. We do not know which data points are outliers, or how many outliersthere are. The rank and number of the subspaces are unknown either. Can wedetect the outliers and segment the samples into their right subspaces,efficiently and exactly? We utilize a so-called {\em Low-Rank Representation}(LRR) method to solve this problem, and prove that under mild technicalconditions, any solution to LRR exactly recovers the row space of the samplesand detect the outliers as well. Since the subspace membership is provablydetermined by the row space, this further implies that LRR can perform exactsubspace segmentation and outlier detection, in an efficient way.

Modeling of Multipath Transport

  In this paper, we propose a model for evaluating the transmission performanceof multipath transport. Previous researches focused exclusively on single pairusers in simple scenarios. The distinct perspective in this paper is to buildmodels for analyzing the performance when multipath transport is used in theentire network scope. We illustrate the influences on the transmissionperformance caused by the variation of network topologies, the services'arrival rate, the services' size and other parameters. We demonstrate throughsimulation that multipath transport could conditionally increase the throughputthan single-path transport. And it has the capability to support higherservices' arrival rate in various network topologies. And higher multi-parentprobability will be beneficial for multipath transport to take its advantages.

Where are your eyes going to look during reading? A critical evaluation  of saccade targeting hypothesis

  The word-based account of saccades drawn by a central gravity of the PVL issupported by two pillars of evidences. The first is the finding of the initialfixation location on a word resembled a normal distribution (Rayner, 1979). Theother is the finding of a moderate slope coefficient between the launch siteand the landing site (b=0.49, see McConkie, Kerr, Reddix, & Zola, 1988). Foursimulations on different saccade targeting strategies and one eye-movementexperiment of Chinese reading have been conducted to evaluate the two findings.We demonstrated that the current understanding of the word-based account is notconclusive by showing an alternative strategy of the word-based account andidentifying the problem with the calculation of the slope coefficient. Althoughalmost all the computational models of eye-movement control during reading havebuilt on the two findings, future efforts should be directed to understand theprecise contribution of different saccade targeting strategies, and to know howtheir weighting might vary across desperate writing systems.

On the initial- and boundary-value problem for 2D micropolar equations  with only angular velocity dissipation

  This paper focuses on the initial- and boundary-value problem for thetwo-dimensional micropolar equations with only angular velocity dissipation ina smooth bounded domain. The aim here is to establish the global existence anduniqueness of solutions by imposing natural boundary conditions and minimalregularity assumptions on the initial data. Besides, the global solution isshown to possess higher regularity when the initial datum is more regular. Toobtain these results, we overcome two main difficulties, one due to the lack offull dissipation and one due to the boundary conditions. In addition to theglobal regularity problem, we also examine the large-time behavior of solutionsand obtain explicit decay rates.

Heterogeneous Supervision for Relation Extraction: A Representation  Learning Approach

  Relation extraction is a fundamental task in information extraction. Mostexisting methods have heavy reliance on annotations labeled by human experts,which are costly and time-consuming. To overcome this drawback, we propose anovel framework, REHession, to conduct relation extractor learning usingannotations from heterogeneous information source, e.g., knowledge base anddomain heuristics. These annotations, referred as heterogeneous supervision,often conflict with each other, which brings a new challenge to the originalrelation extraction task: how to infer the true label from noisy labels for agiven instance. Identifying context information as the backbone of bothrelation extraction and true label discovery, we adopt embedding techniques tolearn the distributed representations of context, which bridges all componentswith mutual enhancement in an iterative fashion. Extensive experimental resultsdemonstrate the superiority of REHession over the state-of-the-art.

Revisiting the Equation of State of Hybrid Stars in the Dyson-Schwinger  Equation Approach to QCD

  We investigate the equation of state(EoS) and the effect of the hadron-quarkphase transition of strong interaction matter in compact stars. The hadronmatter is described with the relativistic mean field theory,and the quarkmatter is described with the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach of QCD. Thecomplete EoS of the hybrid star matter is constructed with not only the Gibbsconstruction but also the 3-window interpolation. The mass-radius relation ofhybrid stars is also investigated. We find that, although the EoSs of both thehadron matter with hyperon and $\Delta$-baryon and the quark matter aregenerally softer than that of the nucleon matter, the 3-window interpolationconstruction may provide an EoS stiff enough for a hybrid star with massexceeding 2$M_{\odot}^{}$ and, in turn, solve the so called "hyperon puzzle".

Feshbach Loss Spectroscopy in an Ultracold $^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K  Mixture

  We perform Feshbach spectroscopy in an ultracold mixture of $^{23}$Na and$^{40}$K with different spin-state combinations. We have observed 24 newinterspecies Feshbach resonances at magnetic field up to 350 G. A fullcoupled-channel calculation is performed to assign these resonances. Amongthem, 12 resonances are identified as d-wave Feshbach resonances. These d-waveFeshbach resonances are about 5 G systematically smaller than the predicationsbased on previous model potential. Taking into account these new experimentalresults, we improve the Born-Oppenheimer potentials between Na and K, andachieve good agreement between the theory and experiment for all the observedFeshbach resonances.

Theoretical Analysis on Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition

  The study on deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) is very importantbecause this mechanism has relevance to safety issues in industries, wherecombustible premixed gases are in general use. However, the quantitativeprediction of DDT is one of the major unsolved problems in combustion anddetonation theory to date. In this paper, the DDT process is studiedtheoretically and the critical condition is given by a concise theoreticalexpression. The results show that a deflagration wave propagating with about60% Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) detonation velocity is a critical condition. Thisvelocity is the maximum propagating velocity of a deflagration wave and almostequal to the sound speed of combustion products. When this critical conation isreached, a C-J detonation is triggered immediately. This is the quantitativecriteria of the DDT process.

Observation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold  $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K+$^{40}$K collisions

  Resonances in ultracold collisions involving heavy molecules are difficult tounderstand, and have proven challenging to detect. Here we report theobservation of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisionsbetween $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules in the rovibrational ground state and$^{40}$K atoms. We prepare the atoms and molecules in various hyperfine levelsof their ground states and observe the loss of molecules as a function of themagnetic field. The atom-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified byobserving an enhancement of the loss rate coefficients. We have observed threeresonances at approximately 101 G in various atom-molecule scattering channels,with the widths being a few hundred milliGauss. The observed atom-moleculeFeshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potentialenergy surface with an unprecedented resolution. Our work will help to improvethe understanding of complicated ultracold collisions, and open up thepossibility of creating ultracold triatomic molecules.

Experimental investigating communication in a superposition of causal  orders

  Quantum mechanics allows for the superposition of quantum states, therebybringing about the great success of quantum communications. Recently, in theso-called quantum switch, the relative orders between quantum operations canalso be coherently controlled with the help of an auxiliary system. Inconventional quantum Shannon theory, however, communication channels areassumed to be combined in a classical way. Relaxing this assumption, it wasshown theoretically that one can transmit information through a quantum switch.Here, we experimentally demonstrate this enhancement on the rates ofcommunication for both classical and quantum information with the help of anoptical quantum switch. Our results present evidence of the advantages of thesuperposition of causal orders in the communications domain.

Localization from Incomplete Euclidean Distance Matrix: Performance  Analysis for the SVD-MDS Approach

  Localizing a cloud of points from noisy measurements of a subset of pairwisedistances has applications in various areas, such as sensor networklocalization and reconstruction of protein conformations from NMR measurements.In [1], Drineas et al. proposed a natural two-stage approach, named SVD-MDS,for this purpose. This approach consists of a low-rank matrix completionalgorithm, named SVD-Reconstruct, to estimate random missing distances, and theclassic multidimensional scaling (MDS) method to estimate the positions ofnodes. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis for this method. Morespecifically, we first establish error bounds for Euclidean distance matrix(EDM) completion in both expectation and tail forms. Utilizing these results,we then derive the error bound for the recovered positions of nodes. In orderto assess the performance of SVD-Reconstruct, we present the minimax lowerbound of the zero-diagonal, symmetric, low-rank matrix completion problem byFano's method. This result reveals that when the noise level is low, theSVD-Reconstruct approach for Euclidean distance matrix completion is suboptimalin the minimax sense; when the noise level is high, SVD-Reconstruct can achievethe optimal rate up to a constant factor.

Allocating Limited Resources to Protect a Massive Number of Targets  using a Game Theoretic Model

  Resource allocation is the process of optimizing the rare resources. In thearea of security, how to allocate limited resources to protect a massive numberof targets is especially challenging. This paper addresses this resourceallocation issue by constructing a game theoretic model. A defender and anattacker are players and the interaction is formulated as a trade-off betweenprotecting targets and consuming resources. The action cost which is anecessary role of consuming resource, is considered in the proposed model.Additionally, a bounded rational behavior model (Quantal Response, QR), whichsimulates a human attacker of the adversarial nature, is introduced to improvethe proposed model. To validate the proposed model, we compare the differentutility functions and resource allocation strategies. The comparison resultssuggest that the proposed resource allocation strategy performs better thanothers in the perspective of utility and resource effectiveness.

Online Newton Step Algorithm with Estimated Gradient

  Online learning with limited information feedback (bandit) tries to solve theproblem where an online learner receives partial feedback information from theenvironment in the course of learning. Under this setting, Flaxman et al.[8]extended Zinkevich's classical Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm [29] byproposing the Online Gradient Descent with Expected Gradient (OGDEG) algorithm.Specifically, it uses a simple trick to approximate the gradient of the lossfunction $f_t$ by evaluating it at a single point and bounds the expectedregret as $\mathcal{O}(T^{5/6})$ [8], where the number of rounds is $T$.Meanwhile, past research efforts have shown that compared with the first-orderalgorithms, second-order online learning algorithms such as Online Newton Step(ONS) [11] can significantly accelerate the convergence rate of traditionalonline learning algorithms. Motivated by this, this paper aims to exploit thesecond-order information to speed up the convergence of the OGDEG algorithm. Inparticular, we extend the ONS algorithm with the trick of expected gradient anddevelop a novel second-order online learning algorithm, i.e., Online NewtonStep with Expected Gradient (ONSEG). Theoretically, we show that the proposedONSEG algorithm significantly reduces the expected regret of OGDEG algorithmfrom $\mathcal{O}(T^{5/6})$ to $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ in the bandit feedbackscenario. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposedalgorithm on multiple real-world datasets.

Phase transition in site-diluted Josephson junction arrays: A numerical  study

  We numerically investigate the intriguing effects produced by randompercolative disorder in two-dimensional Josephson-junction arrays. By dynamicscaling analysis, we evaluate critical temperatures and critical exponents withhigh accuracy. It is observed that, with the introduction of site-diluteddisorder, the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition is eliminated and evolvesinto a continuous transition with power-law divergent correlation length.Moreover, genuine depinning transition and creep motion are studied, evidencefor distinct creep motion types is provided. Our results not only are in goodagreement with the recent experimental findings, but also shed some light onthe relevant phase transitions.

An adaptive routing strategy for packet delivery in complex networks

  We present an efficient routing approach for delivering packets in complexnetworks. On delivering a message from a node to a destination, a node forwardsthe message to a neighbor by estimating the waiting time along the shortestpath from each of its neighbors to the destination. This projected waiting timeis dynamical in nature and the path through which a message is delivered wouldbe adapted to the distribution of messages in the network. Implementing theapproach on scale-free networks, we show that the present approach performsbetter than the shortest-path approach and another approach that takes intoaccount of the waiting time only at the neighboring nodes. Key features innumerical results are explained by a mean field theory. The approach has themerit that messages are distributed among the nodes according to thecapabilities of the nodes in handling messages.

Chemical potential and the gap equation

  In general the kernel of QCD's gap equation possesses a domain of analyticityupon which the equation's solution at nonzero chemical potential is simplyobtained from the in-vacuum result through analytic continuation. On thisdomain the single-quark number- and scalar-density distribution functions aremu-independent. This is illustrated via two models for the gap equation'skernel. The models are alike in concentrating support in the infrared. Theydiffer in the form of the vertex but qualitatively the results are largelyinsensitive to the Ansatz. In vacuum both models realise chiral symmetry in theNambu-Goldstone mode and in the chiral limit, with increasing chemicalpotential, exhibit a first-order chiral symmetry restoring transition atmu~M(0), where M(p^2) is the dressed-quark mass function. There is evidence tosuggest that any associated deconfinement transition is coincident and also offirst-order.

Dynamics of glass phases in the two-dimensional gauge glass model

  Large-scale simulations have been performed on the current-driventwo-dimensional XY gauge glass model with resistively-shunted-junctiondynamics. It is observed that the linear resistivity at low temperatures tendsto zero, providing strong evidence of glass transition at finite temperature.Dynamic scaling analysis demonstrates that perfect collapses of current-voltagedata can be achieved with the glass transition temperature $T_{g}=0.22$, thecorrelation length critical exponent $\nu =1.8$, and the dynamic criticalexponent $ z=2.0$. A genuine continuous depinning transition is found at zerotemperature. For creeping at low temperatures, critical exponents are evaluatedand a non-Arrhenius creep motion is observed in the glass phase.

Cold quarks in medium: an equation of state

  We derive a compact, semi-algebraic expression for the cold quark matterequation of state (EoS) in a covariant model that exhibits coincidentdeconfinement and chiral symmetry restoring transitions in-medium. Along theway we obtain algebraic expressions for: the number- and scalar-densitydistributions in both the confining Nambu and deconfined Wigner phases; and thevacuum-pressure difference between these phases, which defines a bag constant.The confining interaction materially alters the distribution functions fromthose of a Fermi gas and consequently has a significant impact on the model'sthermodynamic properties, which is apparent in the EoS.

Dyson-Schwinger Equations with a Parameterized Metric

  We construct and solve the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) of quark propagatorwith a parameterized metric, which connects the Euclidean metric with theMinkowskian one. We show, in some models, the Minkowskian vacuum is differentfrom the Euclidean vacuum. The usual analytic continuation of Green functiondoes not make sense in these cases. While with the algorithm we proposed andthe quark-gluon vertex ansatz which preserves the Ward-Takahashi identity, thevacuum keeps being unchanged in the evolution of the metric. In this case,analytic continuation becomes meaningful and can be fully carried out.

Phase diagram and critical endpoint for strongly-interacting quarks

  We introduce a method based on the chiral susceptibility, which enables oneto draw a phase diagram in the chemical-potential/temperature plane forstrongly-interacting quarks whose interactions are described by any reasonablegap equation, even if the diagrammatic content of the quark-gluon vertex isunknown. We locate a critical endpoint (CEP) at (\mu^E,T^E) ~ (1.0,0.9)T_c,where T_c is the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration at \mu=0;and find that a domain of phase coexistence opens at the CEP whose areaincreases as a confinement length-scale grows.

Internet Resource Pricing Models, Mechanisms, and Methods

  With the fast development of video and voice network applications, CDN(Content Distribution Networks) and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) content distributiontechnologies have gradually matured. How to effectively use Internet resourcesthus has attracted more and more attentions. For the study of resource pricing,a whole pricing strategy containing pricing models, mechanisms and methodscovers all the related topics. We first introduce three basic Internet resourcepricing models through an Internet cost analysis. Then, with the evolution ofservice types, we introduce several corresponding mechanisms which can ensurepricing implementation and resource allocation. On network resource pricingmethods, we discuss the utility optimization in economics, and emphasize twoclasses of pricing methods (including system optimization and entities'strategic optimizations). Finally, we conclude the paper and forecast theresearch direction on pricing strategy which is applicable to novel servicesituation in the near future.

D-wave superconductivity induced by short-range antiferromagnetic  correlations in the two-dimensional Kondo lattice model

  The possible heavy fermion superconductivity is carefully reexamined in thetwo-dimensional Kondo lattice model with an antiferromagnetic Heisenbergsuperexchange between local magnetic moments. In order to establish aneffective mean field theory in the limit of the paramagnetic heavy Fermi liquidand near the half-filling case, we find that the spinon singlet pairing fromthe local antiferromagnetic short-range correlations can reduce the groundstate energy substantially. In the presence of the Kondo screening effect, theCooper pairs between the conduction electrons is induced. Depending on theratio of the Heisenberg and the Kondo exchange couplings, the resultingsuperconducting state is characterized by either a d-wave nodal or d-wavenodeless state, and a continuous phase transition exists between these twostates. These results are related to some quasi-two dimensional heary fermionsuperconductors.

When is it Biased? Assessing the Representativeness of Twitter's  Streaming API

  Twitter has captured the interest of the scientific community not only forits massive user base and content, but also for its openness in sharing itsdata. Twitter shares a free 1% sample of its tweets through the "StreamingAPI", a service that returns a sample of tweets according to a set ofparameters set by the researcher. Recently, research has pointed to evidence ofbias in the data returned through the Streaming API, raising concern in theintegrity of this data service for use in research scenarios. While theseresults are important, the methodologies proposed in previous work rely on therestrictive and expensive Firehose to find the bias in the Streaming API data.In this work we tackle the problem of finding sample bias without the need for"gold standard" Firehose data. Namely, we focus on finding time periods in theStreaming API data where the trend of a hashtag is significantly different fromits trend in the true activity on Twitter. We propose a solution that focuseson using an open data source to find bias in the Streaming API. Finally, weassess the utility of the data source in sparse data situations and for usersissuing the same query from different regions.

Identifying Users with Opposing Opinions in Twitter Debates

  In recent times, social media sites such as Twitter have been extensivelyused for debating politics and public policies. These debates span millions oftweets and numerous topics of public importance. Thus, it is imperative thatthis vast trove of data is tapped in order to gain insights into public opinionespecially on hotly contested issues such as abortion, gun reforms etc. Thus,in our work, we aim to gauge users' stance on such topics in Twitter. Wepropose ReLP, a semi-supervised framework using a retweet-based labelpropagation algorithm coupled with a supervised classifier to identify userswith differing opinions. In particular, our framework is designed such that itcan be easily adopted to different domains with little human supervision whilestill producing excellent accuracy
