Topological Dirac states beyond $π$ orbitals for silicene on SiC(0001)  surface

  The discovery of intriguing properties related to the Dirac states ingraphene has spurred huge interest in exploring its two-dimensional group-IVcounterparts, such as silicene, germanene, and stanene. However, thesematerials have to be obtained via synthesizing on substrates with stronginterfacial interactions, which usually destroy their intrinsic$\pi$($p_z$)-orbital Dirac states. Here we report a theoretical study on theexistence of Dirac states arising from the $p_{x,y}$ orbitals instead of $p_z$orbitals in silicene on 4H-SiC(0001), which survive in spite of the stronginterfacial interactions. We also show that the exchange field together withthe spin-orbital coupling give rise to a detectable band gap of 1.3 meV. Berrycurvature calculations demonstrate the nontrivial topological nature of suchDirac states with a Chern number $C = 2$, presenting the potential of realizingquantum anomalous Hall effect for silicene on SiC(0001). Finally, we constructa minimal effective model to capture the low-energy physics of this system.This finding is expected to be also applicable to germanene and stanene, andimply great application potentials in nanoelectronics.

Bose Symmetry Interference Effects of $4π$ Final States

  We carefully analyze the relative branching ratios of $4\pi$ final states$\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$, $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0\pi^0$ and $\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0$, fromvarious resonances of $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $0^{-+}$, $2^{++}$. We find that theBose symmetry interference effects would make their ratios to obviously differfrom the naive counting values without considering these effects. The resultsshould be applied to estimate correctly various $4\pi$ decay branching ratiosof relevant resonances.

Designing substrates for silicene and germanene: First-principles  calculations

  We propose a guideline for exploring substrates that stabilize the monolayerhoneycomb structure of silicene and germanene while simultaneously preserve theDirac states: in addition to have a strong binding energy to the monolayer, asuitable substrate should be a large-gap semiconductor with a properworkfunction such that the Dirac point lies in the gap and far from thesubstrate states when their bands align. We illustrate our idea by performingfirst-principles calculations for silicene and germanene on the Al-terminated(0001) surface of Al2O3 . The overlaid monolayers on Al-terminated Al2O3(0001)retain the main structural profile of the low-buckled honeycomb structure via abinding energy comparable to the one between silicene and Ag(111). Unfoldedband structure derived from the k-projection method reveals that gapped Diraccone is formed at the K point due to the structural distortion and theinteraction with the substrate. The gaps of 0.4 eV and 0.3 eV respectively forthe supported silicene and germanene suggest that they may have potentialapplications in nanoelectronics.

Dirac node lines in pure alkali earth metals

  Beryllium is a simple alkali earth metal, but has been the target ofintensive studies for decades because of its unusual electron behaviors atsurfaces. Puzzling aspects include (i) severe deviations from the descriptionof the nearly free electron picture, (ii) anomalously large electron-phononcoupling effect, and (iii) giant Friedal oscillations. The underlying originsfor such anomalous surface electron behaviors have been under active debate,but with no consensus. Here, by means of first-principle calculations, wediscover that this pure metal system, surprisingly, harbors the Dirac node line(DNL) that in turn helps to rationalize many of the existing puzzles. The DNLis featured by a closed line consisting of linear band crossings and itsinduced topological surface band agrees well with previous photoemissionspectroscopy observation on Be (0001) surface. We further reveal that each ofthe elemental alakali earth metals of Mg, Ca, and Sr also harbors the DNL, andspeculate that the fascinating topological property of DNL might naturallyexist in other elemental metals as well.

Epitaxial Growth of Large-area Bilayer Graphene on Ru(0001)

  Large-area bilayer graphene (BG) is grown epitaxially on Ru(0001) surface andcharacterized by low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. The lattice ofthe bottom layer of BG is stretched by 1.2%, while strain is absent from thetop layer. The lattice mismatch between the two layers leads to the formationof a moire pattern with a periodicity of ~21.5 nm and a mixture of AA- andAB-stacking. The root3 x root3 superstructure around atomic defects isattributed to the inter-valley scattering of the delocalized pi-electrons,demonstrating that the as-grown BG behaves like intrinsic free-standinggraphene.

Detection of a superconducting phase in a two-atom layer of hexagonal Ga  film grown on semiconducting GaN(0001)

  The recent observation of superconducting state at atomic scale has motivatedthe pursuit of exotic condensed phases in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here wereport on a superconducting phase in two-monolayer crystalline Ga filmsepitaxially grown on wide band-gap semiconductor GaN(0001). This phase exhibitsa hexagonal structure and only 0.552 nm in thickness, nevertheless, bringsabout a superconducting transition temperature Tc as high as 5.4 K, confirmedby in situ scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and ex situ electricalmagneto-transport and magnetization measurements. The anisotropy of criticalmagnetic field and Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition are observed,typical for the 2D superconductivity. Our results demonstrate a novel platformfor exploring atomic-scale 2D superconductor, with great potential forunderstanding of the interface superconductivity.

Dirac Fermion in Strongly-Bound Graphene Systems

  It is highly desirable to integrate graphene into existing semiconductortechnology, where the combined system is thermodynamically stable yet maintaina Dirac cone at the Fermi level. Firstprinciples calculations reveal that acertain transition metal (TM) intercalated graphene/SiC(0001), such as thestrongly-bound graphene/intercalated-Mn/SiC, could be such a system. Differentfrom free-standing graphene, the hybridization between graphene and Mn/SiCleads to the formation of a dispersive Dirac cone of primarily TM d characters.The corresponding Dirac spectrum is still isotropic, and the transport behavioris nearly identical to that of free-standing graphene for a bias as large as0.6 V, except that the Fermi velocity is half that of graphene. A simple modelHamiltonian is developed to qualitatively account for the physics of thetransfer of the Dirac cone from a dispersive system (e.g., graphene) to anoriginally non-dispersive system (e.g., TM).

High-$T_c$ $d^{0}$ ferromagnetism in a doped Mott insulator: the case of  hydrogenated epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001)

  We show that the $d^{0}$ ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature ($T_c$)can be achieved in the electron doped hydrogenated epitaxial graphene on somecertain SiC substrates through first-principles calculations. The pristinesystems are found to be a Mott insulator independent of SiC polytypes (2$H$,4$H$ or 6$H$) which, however, play a significant role in the modulation ofmagnetic interaction. Carrier doping enhances the ferromagnetic coupling due tothe double exchange mechanism and thus realizes the phase transition fromantiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism. A $T_c$ of around 400 K is predicted onthe 2$H$-SiC. We employ a non-degenerate Hubbard model to demonstrate how theSiC affects the interfacial magnetism in intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion andintersite hopping interactions.

Strain effect engineered in α-Al2O3/monolayer MoS2 interface by  first principle calculations

  With the advances in low dimensional transition metal dichalcolgenides(TMDCs) based metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), theinterface between semiconductors and dielectrics has received considerableattention due to its dramatic effects on the morphology and charge transport ofsemiconductors. In this study, first principle calculations were utilized toinvestigate the strain effect induced by the interface between Al2O3 (0001) andmonolayer MoS2. The results indicate that Al2O3 in 1.3nm thickness can applythe strain of 0.3% on MoS2 monolayer. The strain effect monotonically increaseswith the larger thickness of the dielectric layer. Also, the study ontemperature effect indicates the monotonic lattice expansion induced by thehigher temperature. Our study proposes that the dielectric engineering can bean effective tool for strain effect in the nanotechnology.
