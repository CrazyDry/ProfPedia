Learning a Hybrid Architecture for Sequence Regression and Annotation

  When learning a hidden Markov model (HMM), sequen- tial observations canoften be complemented by real-valued summary response variables generated fromthe path of hid- den states. Such settings arise in numerous domains, includ-ing many applications in biology, like motif discovery and genome annotation.In this paper, we present a flexible frame- work for jointly modeling bothlatent sequence features and the functional mapping that relates the summaryresponse variables to the hidden state sequence. The algorithm is com- patiblewith a rich set of mapping functions. Results show that the availability ofadditional continuous response vari- ables can simultaneously improve theannotation of the se- quential observations and yield good predictionperformance in both synthetic data and real-world datasets.

A branching process model for flow cytometry and budding index  measurements in cell synchrony experiments

  We present a flexible branching process model for cell population dynamics insynchrony/time-series experiments used to study important cellular processes.Its formulation is constructive, based on an accounting of the unique cohortsin the population as they arise and evolve over time, allowing it to be writtenin closed form. The model can attribute effects to subsets of the population,providing flexibility not available using the models historically applied tothese populations. It provides a tool for in silico synchronization of thepopulation and can be used to deconvolve population-level experimentalmeasurements, such as temporal expression profiles. It also allows for thedirect comparison of assay measurements made from multiple experiments. Themodel can be fit either to budding index or DNA content measurements, or both,and is easily adaptable to new forms of data. The ability to use DNA contentdata makes the model applicable to almost any organism. We describe the modeland illustrate its utility and flexibility in a study of cell cycle progressionin the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
