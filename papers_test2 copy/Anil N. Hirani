A Dihedral Acute Triangulation of the Cube

  It is shown that there exists a dihedral acute triangulation of thethree-dimensional cube. The method of constructing the acute triangulation isdescribed, and symmetries of the triangulation are discussed.

Cohomologous Harmonic Cochains

  We describe algorithms for finding harmonic cochains, an essential ingredientfor solving elliptic partial differential equations in exterior calculus.Harmonic cochains are also useful in computational topology and computergraphics. We focus on finding harmonic cochains cohomologous to a givencocycle. Amongst other things, this allows localization near topologicalfeatures of interest. We derive a weighted least squares method by proving adiscrete Hodge-deRham theorem on the isomorphism between the space of harmoniccochains and cohomology. The solution obtained either satisfies the Whitneyform finite element exterior calculus equations or the discrete exteriorcalculus equations for harmonic cochains, depending on the discrete Hodge starused.

PyDEC: Software and Algorithms for Discretization of Exterior Calculus

  This paper describes the algorithms, features and implementation of PyDEC, aPython library for computations related to the discretization of exteriorcalculus. PyDEC facilitates inquiry into both physical problems on manifolds aswell as purely topological problems on abstract complexes. We describeefficient algorithms for constructing the operators and objects that arise indiscrete exterior calculus, lowest order finite element exterior calculus andin related topological problems. Our algorithms are formulated in terms ofhigh-level matrix operations which extend to arbitrary dimension. As a result,our implementations map well to the facilities of numerical libraries such asNumPy and SciPy. The availability of such libraries makes Python suitable forprototyping numerical methods. We demonstrate how PyDEC is used to solvephysical and topological problems through several concise examples.

Numerical Experiments for Darcy Flow on a Surface Using Mixed Exterior  Calculus Methods

  There are very few results on mixed finite element methods on surfaces. Atheory for the study of such methods was given recently by Holst and Stern,using a variational crimes framework in the context of finite element exteriorcalculus. However, we are not aware of any numerical experiments where mixedfinite elements derived from discretizations of exterior calculus are used fora surface domain. This short note shows results of our preliminary experimentsusing mixed methods for Darcy flow (hence scalar Poisson's equation in mixedform) on surfaces. We demonstrate two numerical methods. One is derived fromthe primal-dual Discrete Exterior Calculus and the other from lowest orderfinite element exterior calculus. The programming was done in the languagePython, using the PyDEC package which makes the code very short and easy toread. The qualitative convergence studies seem to be promising.

Equivalence Theorems in Numerical Analysis : Integration,  Differentiation and Interpolation

  We show that if a numerical method is posed as a sequence of operators actingon data and depending on a parameter, typically a measure of the size ofdiscretization, then consistency, convergence and stability can be related by aLax-Richtmyer type equivalence theorem -- a consistent method is convergent ifand only if it is stable. We define consistency as convergence on a densesubspace and stability as discrete well-posedness. In some applicationsconvergence is harder to prove than consistency or stability since convergencerequires knowledge of the solution. An equivalence theorem can be useful insuch settings. We give concrete instances of equivalence theorems forpolynomial interpolation, numerical differentiation, numerical integrationusing quadrature rules and Monte Carlo integration.

Triangulation of Simple 3D Shapes with Well-Centered Tetrahedra

  A completely well-centered tetrahedral mesh is a triangulation of a threedimensional domain in which every tetrahedron and every triangle contains itscircumcenter in its interior. Such meshes have applications in scientificcomputing and other fields. We show how to triangulate simple domains usingcompletely well-centered tetrahedra. The domains we consider here are space,infinite slab, infinite rectangular prism, cube and regular tetrahedron. Wealso demonstrate single tetrahedra with various combinations of the propertiesof dihedral acuteness, 2-well-centeredness and 3-well-centeredness.

Numerical Convergence of Discrete Exterior Calculus on Arbitrary Surface  Meshes

  Discrete exterior calculus (DEC) is a structure-preserving numericalframework for partial differential equations solution, particularly suitablefor simplicial meshes. A longstanding and widespread assumption has been thatDEC requires special (Delaunay) triangulations, which complicated the meshgeneration process especially on curved surfaces. This paper presents numericalevidences demonstrating that this restriction is unnecessary. Convergenceexperiments are carried out for various physical problems using both Delaunayand non-Delaunay triangulations. Signed diagonal definition for the key DECoperator (Hodge star) is adopted. The errors converge as expected for allconsidered meshes and experiments. This relieves the DEC paradigm fromunnecessary triangulation limitation.

Well-Centered Triangulation

  Meshes composed of well-centered simplices have nice orthogonal dual meshes(the dual Voronoi diagram). This is useful for certain numerical algorithmsthat prefer such primal-dual mesh pairs. We prove that well-centered meshesalso have optimality properties and relationships to Delaunay and minmax angletriangulations. We present an iterative algorithm that seeks to transform agiven triangulation in two or three dimensions into a well-centered one byminimizing a cost function and moving the interior vertices while keeping themesh connectivity and boundary vertices fixed. The cost function is a directresult of a new characterization of well-centeredness in arbitrary dimensionsthat we present. Ours is the first optimization-based heuristic forwell-centeredness, and the first one that applies in both two and threedimensions. We show the results of applying our algorithm to small and largetwo-dimensional meshes, some with a complex boundary, and obtain awell-centered tetrahedralization of the cube. We also show numerical evidencethat our algorithm preserves gradation and that it improves the maximum andminimum angles of acute triangulations created by the best known previousmethod.

Delaunay Hodge Star

  We define signed dual volumes at all dimensions for circumcentric dualmeshes. We show that for pairwise Delaunay triangulations with mild boundaryassumptions these signed dual volumes are positive. This allows the use of suchDelaunay meshes for Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) because the discrete Hodgestar operator can now be correctly defined for such meshes. This operator iscrucial for DEC and is a diagonal matrix with the ratio of primal and dualvolumes along the diagonal. A correct definition requires that all entries bepositive. DEC is a framework for numerically solving differential equations onmeshes and for geometry processing tasks and has had considerable impact incomputer graphics and scientific computing. Our result allows the use of DECwith a much larger class of meshes than was previously considered possible.

The complete set of minimal simple graphs that support unsatisfiable  2-CNFs

  A propositional logic sentence in conjunctive normal form that has clauses oflength two (a 2-CNF) can be associated with a multigraph in which the verticescorrespond to the variables and edges to clauses. We first show that every suchsentence that has been reduced, that is, which is unchanged under applicationof certain tautologies, is equisatisfiable to a 2-CNF whose associatedmultigraph is, in fact, a simple graph. Our main result is a completecharacterization of graphs that can support unsatisfiable 2-CNF sentences. Weshow that a simple graph can support an unsatisfiable reduced 2-CNF sentence ifand only if it contains any one of four specific small graphs as a topologicalminor. Equivalently, all reduced 2-CNF sentences supported on a given simplegraph are satisfiable if and only if all subdivisions of those four graphs areforbidden as subgraphs of of the original graph. We conclude with a discussionof why the Robertson-Seymour graph minor theorem does not apply in ourapproach.

Numerical method for Darcy flow derived using Discrete Exterior Calculus

  We derive a numerical method for Darcy flow, hence also for Poisson'sequation in mixed (first order) form, based on discrete exterior calculus(DEC). Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smoothmanifolds and DEC is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such astriangle and tetrahedral meshes. DEC is a coordinate invariant discretization,in that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh.We start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the languageof exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differentialform and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the frameworkprovided by DEC for discretizing differential forms and operators that act onforms. We also develop a discretization for spatially dependent Hodge star thatvaries with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to addressdiscontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discretenon-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. Theresulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type,with a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposednumerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These includepatch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically knownsolution in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeabilityvalues, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. Wealso show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. Aconvergence experiment is also included for Darcy flow on a surface. A shortintroduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus isincluded in this paper. We also include a discussion of the boundary conditionin terms of exterior calculus.

Optimal Homologous Cycles, Total Unimodularity, and Linear Programming

  Given a simplicial complex with weights on its simplices, and a nontrivialcycle on it, we are interested in finding the cycle with minimal weight whichis homologous to the given one. Assuming that the homology is defined withinteger coefficients, we show the following : For a finite simplicial complex$K$ of dimension greater than $p$, the boundary matrix $[\partial_{p+1}]$ istotally unimodular if and only if $H_p(L, L_0)$ is torsion-free, for all puresubcomplexes $L_0, L$ in $K$ of dimensions $p$ and $p+1$ respectively, where$L_0$ is a subset of $L$. Because of the total unimodularity of the boundarymatrix, we can solve the optimization problem, which is inherently an integerprogramming problem, as a linear program and obtain integer solution. Thus theproblem of finding optimal cycles in a given homology class can be solved inpolynomial time. This result is surprising in the backdrop of a recent resultwhich says that the problem is NP-hard under $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients which,being a field, is in general easier to deal with. One consequence of ourresult, among others, is that one can compute in polynomial time an optimal2-cycle in a given homology class for any finite simplicial complex embedded in$\mathbb{R}^3$. Our optimization approach can also be used for various relatedproblems, such as finding an optimal chain homologous to a given one when theseare not cycles.

Least Squares Ranking on Graphs

  Given a set of alternatives to be ranked, and some pairwise comparison data,ranking is a least squares computation on a graph. The vertices are thealternatives, and the edge values comprise the comparison data. The basic ideais very simple and old: come up with values on vertices such that theirdifferences match the given edge data. Since an exact match will usually beimpossible, one settles for matching in a least squares sense. This formulationwas first described by Leake in 1976 for rankingfootball teams and appears asan example in Professor Gilbert Strang's classic linear algebra textbook. Ifone is willing to look into the residual a little further, then the problemreally comes alive, as shown effectively by the remarkable recent paper ofJiang et al. With or without this twist, the humble least squares problem ongraphs has far-reaching connections with many current areas ofresearch. Theseconnections are to theoretical computer science (spectral graph theory, andmultilevel methods for graph Laplacian systems); numerical analysis (algebraicmultigrid, and finite element exterior calculus); other mathematics (Hodgedecomposition, and random clique complexes); and applications (arbitrage, andranking of sports teams). Not all of these connections are explored in thispaper, but many are. The underlying ideas are easy to explain, requiring onlythe four fundamental subspaces from elementary linear algebra. One of our aimsis to explain these basic ideas and connections, to get researchers in manyfields interested in this topic. Another aim is to use our numericalexperiments for guidance on selecting methods and exposing the need for furtherdevelopment.

Discrete Exterior Calculus

  We present a theory and applications of discrete exterior calculus onsimplicial complexes of arbitrary finite dimension. This can be thought of ascalculus on a discrete space. Our theory includes not only discretedifferential forms but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting onthese objects. This allows us to address the various interactions between formsand vector fields (such as Lie derivatives) which are important inapplications. Previous attempts at discrete exterior calculus have addressedonly differential forms. We also introduce the notion of a circumcentric dualof a simplicial complex. The importance of dual complexes in this field hasbeen well understood, but previous researchers have used barycentricsubdivision or barycentric duals. We show that the use of circumcentric dualsis crucial in arriving at a theory of discrete exterior calculus that admitsboth vector fields and forms.

Geometric and Combinatorial Properties of Well-Centered Triangulations  in Three and Higher Dimensions

  An n-simplex is said to be n-well-centered if its circumcenter lies in itsinterior. We introduce several other geometric conditions and an algebraiccondition that can be used to determine whether a simplex is n-well-centered.These conditions, together with some other observations, are used to describerestrictions on the local combinatorial structure of simplicial meshes in whichevery simplex is well-centered. In particular, it is shown that in a3-well-centered (2-well-centered) tetrahedral mesh there are at least 7 (9)edges incident to each interior vertex, and these bounds are sharp. Moreover,it is shown that, in stark contrast to the 2-dimensional analog, where thereare exactly two vertex links that prevent a well-centered triangle mesh in R^2,there are infinitely many vertex links that prohibit a well-centeredtetrahedral mesh in R^3.

Discrete exterior calculus discretization of incompressible  Navier-Stokes equations over surface simplicial meshes

  A conservative discretization of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations isdeveloped based on discrete exterior calculus (DEC). A distinguishing featureof our method is the use of an algebraic discretization of the interior productoperator and a combinatorial discretization of the wedge product. The governingequations are first rewritten using the exterior calculus notation, replacingvector calculus differential operators by the exterior derivative, Hodge starand wedge product operators. The discretization is then carried out bysubstituting with the corresponding discrete operators based on the DECframework. Numerical experiments for flows over surfaces reveal a second orderaccuracy for the developed scheme when using structured-triangular meshes, andfirst order accuracy for otherwise unstructured meshes. By construction, themethod is conservative in that both mass and vorticity are conserved up tomachine precision. The relative error in kinetic energy for inviscid flow testcases converges in a second order fashion with both the mesh size and the timestep.

The Least Spanning Area of a Knot and the Optimal Bounding Chain Problem

  Two fundamental objects in knot theory are the minimal genus surface and theleast area surface bounded by a knot in a 3-dimensional manifold. When the knotis embedded in a general 3-manifold, the problems of finding these surfaceswere shown to be NP-complete and NP-hard respectively. However, there isevidence that the special case when the ambient manifold is R^3, or moregenerally when the second homology is trivial, should be considerably moretractable. Indeed, we show here that a natural discrete version of the leastarea surface can be found in polynomial time. The precise setting is that theknot is a 1-dimensional subcomplex of a triangulation of the ambient3-manifold. The main tool we use is a linear programming formulation of theOptimal Bounding Chain Problem (OBCP), where one is required to find thesmallest norm chain with a given boundary. While the decision variant of OBCPis NP-complete in general, we give conditions under which it can be solved inpolynomial time. We then show that the least area surface can be constructedfrom the optimal bounding chain using a standard desingularization argumentfrom 3-dimensional topology. We also prove that the related Optimal HomologousChain Problem is NP-complete for homology with integer coefficients,complementing the corresponding result of Chen and Freedman for mod 2 homology.

A posteriori error estimates for finite element exterior calculus: The  de Rham complex

  Finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) has been developed over the pastdecade as a framework for constructing and analyzing stable and accuratenumerical methods for partial differential equations by employing differentialcomplexes. The recent work of Arnold, Falk and Winther \cite{ArFaWi2010}includes a well-developed theory of finite element methods for Hodge Laplaceproblems, including a priori error estimates. In this work we focus ondeveloping a posteriori error estimates in which the computational error isbounded by some computable functional of the discrete solution and problemdata. More precisely, we prove a posteriori error estimates of residual typefor Arnold-Falk-Winther mixed finite element methods for Hodge-de Rham Laplaceproblems. While a number of previous works consider a posteriori errorestimation for Maxwell's equations and mixed formulations of the scalarLaplacian, the approach we take is distinguished by unified treatment of thevarious Hodge Laplace problems arising in the de Rham complex, consistent useof the language and analytical framework of differential forms, and thedevelopment of a posteriori error estimates for harmonic forms and the effectsof their approximation on the resulting numerical method for the HodgeLaplacian.

Edge Contractions and Simplicial Homology

  We study the effect of edge contractions on simplicial homology because thesecontractions have turned to be useful in various applications involvingtopology. It was observed previously that contracting edges that satisfy the socalled link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional complexes, andhomotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation inall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensionalcomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-linkcondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. Weprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensionalhomology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does notintroduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,though some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, thesurjection in relative homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relativetorsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link conditionalone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and thep-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology andrelative torsion are motivated by recent results on computing optimalhomologous chains, which state that such problems can be solved by linearprogramming if the complex has no relative torsion. Edge contractions that donot introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts.
