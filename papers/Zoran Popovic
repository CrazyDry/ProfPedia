On the Origin of the 2DEG Carrier Density at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$  Interface

  Transport measurements of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at theLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface have found a density of carriers much lower thanexpected from the "polar catastrophe" arguments. From a detaildensity-functional study, we suggest how this discrepancy may be reconciled. Wefind that electrons occupy multiple subbands at the interface leading to a richarray of transport properties. Some electrons are confined to a singleinterfacial layer and susceptible to localization, while others with smallmasses and extended over several layers are expected to contribute totransport.

Using theobtained results, we considered the influence of the electron-impact mechanismon line shapes in spectra of chemically peculiar stars and white dwarfs.

Josephson effect and spin-triplet pairing correlations in SF1F2S  junctions

  We study theoretically the Josephson effect and pairing correlations inplanar SF1F2S junctions that consist of conventional superconductors (S)connected by two metallic monodomain ferromagnets (F1 and F2) with transparentinterfaces. We obtain both spin-singlet and -triplet pair amplitudes and theJosephson current-phase relations for arbitrary orientation of themagnetizations using the self-consistent solutions of Eilenberger equations inthe clean limit and for a moderate disorder in ferromagnets. We find that thelong-range spin-triplet correlations cannot prevail in symmetric junctions withequal ferromagnetic layers. Surprisingly, the long-range spin-tripletcorrelations give the dominant second harmonic in the Josephson current-phaserelation of highly asymmetric SF1F2S junctions. The effect is robust againstmoderate disorder and variations in the layers thickness and exchange energy offerromagnets.

Raman scattering study of phonon and spin modes in (TMTSF)2PF6

  We have studied polarized Raman spectra of (TMTSF)2PF6 single crystals in thewide spectral and temperature range using different laser energies. We observedand assigned 23 Raman active modes. The carbon C=C in-phase and out-of-phasestretching modes at 1464 cm-1 and 1602 cm-1 show strongelectron-molecular-vibration coupling. The mode at about 1565 cm-1 istemperature independent below 50 K due to the methyl group motion freezing. For(TMTSF)2PF6 in the spin density wave phase for a temperature induceddimensionality 1D (quarter filled dimerized linear chain with correlatedelectrons) the spin gapless magnon spectra have been calculated. No evidence ofspin-lattice coupling or spin-related modes is found in the Raman spectra inthe spin density wave phase.

Odd triplet superconductivity in clean and moderately disordered SFFS  junctions

  We study the Josephson effect and pairing correlations in SFFS junctions thatconsist of conventional superconductors (S) connected through two metallicmonodomain ferromagnets (F) with transparent and spin inactive interfaces. Wesolve the Eilenberger equations for arbitrary relative orientation ofmagnetizations of the two F layers in the clean limit and for moderate disorderin ferromagnets. Spatial variation of pair amplitudes, singlet $f_s$, and oddin frequency triplet $f_{t0}$ and $f_{t1}$, with 0 and $\pm1$ spin projections,as well as the Josephson current-phase relations are calculated for differentvalues of the ferromagnetic layers thickness and angle $\alpha$ betweenin-plane magnetizations. In contrast to the dirty limit case, we find that for$0<\alpha<\pi$ both spin singlet and triplet pair amplitudes in F layerspower-law decay in the same oscillatory manner with distance from the FSinterfaces. This decay gets faster as the impurity-scattering rate inferromagnets is increased. The computed triplet amplitude $f_{t1}$ has oppositesigns in the two magnet regions, penetrates into the superconductors andmonotonically decays over the same distance, which is the superconductingcoherence length, as the singlet amplitude $f_s$ saturates to the bulk value.We point out that influence of misorientation of magnetizations on theJosephson current can not be attributed directly to the appearance of oddtriplet correlations.

Optical Properties of the Spin-Ladder Compound Sr_{14}Cu_{24}O_{41}

  We report the measurements of the pseudodielectric function, far-infraredreflectivity and Raman scattering spectra in Sr_{14}Cu_{24}O_{41} singlecrystal. We study the lattice and the spin dynamics of the Cu$_2$O$_3$ spinladders and CuO$_2$ chains of this compound. The ellipsometric and the opticalreflectivity measurements yield the gap values of 1.4 eV, 1.86 eV, 2.34 eV (2.5eV) for the ladders (chains) along the {\bf c}-axis and 2.4 eV along the {\bfa}-axis. The electronic structure of the Cu$_2$O$_3$ ladders is analyzed usingtight-binding approach for the correlated electron systems. The correlation gapvalue of 1.4 eV is calculated with the transfer energy (hopping) parameters$t=t_{0}$=0.26 eV, along and perpendicular to legs, $t_{xy}$=0.026 eV(interladder hopping) and U=2.1 eV, as a Coulomb repulsion. The opticalparameters of the infrared active phonons and plasmons are obtained byoscillator fitting procedure of the reflectivity spectra. Raman scatteringspectra are measured at different temperatures using different laser lineenergies. The two-magnon peak is observed at about 2880 cm$^{-1}$. Attemperatures below 150 K the new infrared and Raman modes appear due to thecharge ordering.

Polarized far-infrared and Raman spectra of SrCuO2 single crystals

  We measured polarized far-infrared reflectivity and Raman scattering spectraof SrCuO$_2$ single crystals. The frequencies for infrared-active modes weredetermined using an oscillator-fitting procedure of reflectivity data. TheRaman spectra were measured at different temperatures using several laserenergies $\omega_L$. In addition to eight of twelve Raman active modes,predicted by factor-group analysis, we observed a complex structure in theRaman spectra for polarization parallel to the {\bf c}-axis, which consists ofRaman-allowed A$_g$ symmetry modes, and B$_{1u}$ LO infrared-active(Raman-forbidden) modes of the first and higher order as well as theircombinations. The Raman-forbidden modes have a stronger intensity at higher$\omega_L$ than the Raman-allowed ones. In order to explain this resonanceeffect, we measured the dielectric function and optical reflection spectra ofSrCuO$_2$ in the visible range. We show that the Raman-allowed A$_g$ symmetrymodes are resonantly enhanced when a laser energy is close to $E_0$, whileRaman-forbidden (IR-active) modes resonate strongly for laser line energiesclose to the electronic transition of higher energy gaps.

Optical studies of gap, hopping energies and the Anderson-Hubbard  parameter in the zigzag-chain compound SrCuO2

  We have investigated the electronic structure of the zigzag ladder (chain)compound SrCuO2 combining polarized optical absorption, reflection,photoreflectance and pseudo-dielectric function measurements with the modelcalculations. These measurements yield an energy gap of 1.42 eV (1.77 eV) at300 K along (perpendicular) to the Cu-O chains. We have found that the lowestenergy gap, the correlation gap, is temperature independent. The electronicstructure of this oxide is calculated using both thelocal-spin-density-approximation with gradient correction method, and thetight-binding theory for the correlated electrons. The calculated density ofelectronic states for non-correlated and correlated electrons showsquasi-one-dimensional character. The correlation gap values of 1.42 eV(indirect transition) and 1.88 eV (direct transition) have been calculated withthe electron hopping parameters t = 0.30 eV (along a chain), t_yz = 0.12 eV(between chains) and the Anderson-Hubbard repulsion on copper sites U= 2.0 eV.We concluded that SrCuO_2 belongs to the correlated-gap insulators.

Charge density wave modulation and gap measurements in CeTe$_3$

  We present a study of charge density wave (CDW) ordering in CeTe$_3$ at roomtemperature using a scanning tunneling microscope and Raman spectroscopy. Twocharacteristic CDW ordering wavevectors obtained from the Fourier analysis areassessed to be $|{\bf \textbf{c}}^\ast-{\bf q}|=4.19\,{\rm nm}^{-1}$ and $|{\bfq}|=10.26\,{\rm nm}^{-1}$ where $|{\bf c}^\ast| = 2\pi/c$ is the reciprocallattice vector. The scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements, along withinelastic light (Raman) scattering measurements, show a CDW gap $\Delta_{\rmmax}$ of approximately 0.37 eV. In addition to the CDW modulation, we observean organization of the Te sheet atoms in an array of alternating V- and N-groups along the CDW modulation, as predicted in the literature.

Frustrated spin order and stripe fluctuations in FeSe

  The charge and spin dynamics of the structurally simplest iron-basedsuperconductor, FeSe, may hold the key to understanding the physics of hightemperature superconductors in general. Unlike the iron pnictides, FeSe lackslong range magnetic order in spite of a similar structural transition around90\,K. Here, we report results of Raman scattering experiments as a function oftemperature and polarization, compared to simulations from a frustrated spinmodel. Both experiment and theory find a persistent low energy peak close to500\,cm$^{-1}$ in $B_{1g}$ symmetry, which softens slightly around 100\,K, thatwe assign to spin excitations. By comparing with results from neutronscattering, this study provides evidence for nearly frustrated stripe order inFeSe.

Electronic structure and optical properties of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ under  epitaxial strain

  We study the modification of the electronic structure in the strongspin-orbit coupled Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ by epitaxial strain using density functionalmethods. Structural optimization shows that strain changes the internalstructural parameters such as the Ir-O-Ir bond angle, which has an importanteffect on the band structure. An interesting prediction is the $\Gamma - $Xcrossover of the valence band maximum with strain, while the conduction minimumat M remains unchanged. This in turn suggests strong strain dependence of thetransport properties for the hole doped system, but not when the system iselectron-doped. Taking the measured value of the $\Gamma-X$ separation for theunstrained case, we predict the $\Gamma - $X crossover of the valence bandmaximum to occur for the tensile epitaxial strain $e_{xx} \approx 3\%$. Aminimal tight-binding model within the $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ subspace isdeveloped to describe the main features of the band structure. The opticalabsorption spectra under epitaxial strain are computed using density-functionaltheory, which explains the observed anisotropy in the optical spectra with thepolarization of the incident light. We show that the optical transitionsbetween the Ir (d) states, which are dipole forbidden, can be explained interms of the admixture of Ir (p) orbitals with the Ir (d) bands.
