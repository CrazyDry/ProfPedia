Serializability, not Serial: Concurrency Control and Availability in  Multi-Datacenter Datastores

  We present a framework for concurrency control and availability inmulti-datacenter datastores. While we consider Google's Megastore as ourmotivating example, we define general abstractions for key components, makingour solution extensible to any system that satisfies the abstractionproperties. We first develop and analyze a transaction management andreplication protocol based on a straightforward implementation of the Paxosalgorithm. Our investigation reveals that this protocol acts as a concurrencyprevention mechanism rather than a concurrency control mechanism. We thenpropose an enhanced protocol called Paxos with Combination and Promotion(Paxos-CP) that provides true transaction concurrency while requiring the sameper instance message complexity as the basic Paxos protocol. Finally, wecompare the performance of Paxos and Paxos-CP in a multi-datacenterexperimental study, and we demonstrate that Paxos-CP results in significantlyfewer aborted transactions than basic Paxos.
