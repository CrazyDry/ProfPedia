Exact Phase Transitions in Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems

  In this paper we propose a new type of random CSP model, called Model RB,which is a revision to the standard Model B. It is proved that phasetransitions from a region where almost all problems are satisfiable to a regionwhere almost all problems are unsatisfiable do exist for Model RB as the numberof variables approaches infinity. Moreover, the critical values at which thephase transitions occur are also known exactly. By relating the hardness ofModel RB to Model B, it is shown that there exist a lot of hard instances inModel RB.
