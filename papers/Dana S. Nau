Using Game Theory to Study the Evolution of Cultural Norms

  We discuss how to use evolutionary game theory (EGT) as a framework for
studying how cultural dynamics and structural properties can influence the
evolution of norms and behaviors within a society. We provide a brief tutorial
on how EGT works, and discuss what kinds of insights it can provide. We then
describe three published studies in which we have developed EGT models that
help explain how structural and external conditions in a society affect the
emergence of social norms.


Tipping Points for Norm Change in Human Cultures

  Humans interact with each other on a daily basis by developing and
maintaining various social norms and it is critical to form a deeper
understanding of how such norms develop, how they change, and how fast they
change. In this work, we develop an evolutionary game-theoretic model based on
research in cultural psychology that shows that humans in various cultures
differ in their tendencies to conform with those around them. Using this model,
we analyze the evolutionary relationships between the tendency to conform and
how quickly a population reacts when conditions make a change in norm
desirable. Our analysis identifies conditions when a tipping point is reached
in a population, causing norms to change rapidly.


Understanding Norm Change: An Evolutionary Game-Theoretic Approach
  (Extended Version)

  Human societies around the world interact with each other by developing and
maintaining social norms, and it is critically important to understand how such
norms emerge and change. In this work, we define an evolutionary game-theoretic
model to study how norms change in a society, based on the idea that different
strength of norms in societies translate to different game-theoretic
interaction structures and incentives. We use this model to study, both
analytically and with extensive agent-based simulations, the evolutionary
relationships of the need for coordination in a society (which is related to
its norm strength) with two key aspects of norm change: cultural inertia
(whether or how quickly the population responds when faced with conditions that
make a norm change desirable), and exploration rate (the willingness of agents
to try out new strategies). Our results show that a high need for coordination
leads to both high cultural inertia and a low exploration rate, while a low
need for coordination leads to low cultural inertia and high exploration rate.
This is the first work, to our knowledge, on understanding the evolutionary
causal relationships among these factors.
