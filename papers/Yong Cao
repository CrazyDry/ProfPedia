Monitoring Mechanical Motion of Carbon Nanotube based Nanomotor by  Optical Absorption Spectrum

  The optical absorption spectrums of nanomotors made from double-wall carbonnanotubes have been calculated with the time-dependent density functional basedtight binding method. When the outer short tube of the nanomotor moves along orrotates around the inner long tube, the peaks in the spectrum will graduallyevolve and may shift periodically, the amplitude of which can be as large ashundreds of meV. We show that the features and behaviors of the opticalabsorption spectrum could be used to monitor the mechanical motions of thedouble-wall carbon nanotube based nanomotor.

Ambipolar Graphene Field Effect Transistors by Local Metal Side Gates

  We demonstrate ambipolar graphene field effect transistors individuallycontrolled by local metal side gates. The side gated field effect can haveon/off ratio comparable with that of the global back gate, and can be tuned ina large range by the back gate and/or a second side gate. We also find that theside gated field effect is significantly stronger by electrically floating theback gate compared to grounding the back gate, consistent with the finding fromelectrostatic simulation.

Laser spot position dependent photothermal mode cooling of a  micro-cantilever

  We explore the laser spot position (LSP) dependent photothermal mode coolingof a micro-cantilever in a Fabry-P\'erot (FP) cavity. Depending on the LSPalong the lever, photothermal coupling to the first two mechanical modes can beeither parallel or anti-parallel. This LSP dependent behavior is analyzedtheoretically by a simple model, which is in quantitatively agreement with ourexperimental observation. From simulation, the parallel and anti-parallelcoupling region is identified along the lever. We conclude that a moreefficient mode cooling may be achieved in the parallel coupling region.

Cavity mediated effective interaction between phonon and magnon

  Optomagnonics and optomechanics have various applications ranging fromtunable light sources to optical manipulation for quantum information science.Here, we propose a hybrid system with the interaction between phonon and magnonwhich could be tuned by the electromagnetic field based on the radiationpressure and magneto-optical effect. The self energy of the magnon and phononinduced by the electromagnetic field and the influence of the thermal noise arestudied. Moreover, the topological features of the hybrid system is illustratedwith resort to the dynamical encircling with the exceptional points, and thechiral characteristics under these encirclements are found.

Electronic Transport in Chemical Vapor Deposited Graphene Synthesized on  Cu: Quantum Hall Effect and Weak Localization

  We report on electronic properties of graphene synthesized by chemical vapordeposition (CVD) on copper then transferred to SiO2/Si. Wafer-scale (up to 4inches) graphene films have been synthesized, consisting dominantly ofmonolayer graphene as indicated by spectroscopic Raman mapping. Low temperaturetransport measurements are performed on micro devices fabricated from such CVDgraphene, displaying ambipolar field effect (with on/off ratio ~5 and carriermobilities up to ~3000 cm^2/Vs) and "half-integer" quantum Hall effect, ahall-mark of intrinsic electronic properties of monolayer graphene. We alsoobserve weak localization and extract information about phase coherence andscattering of carriers.

Regular orbits and p-regular orbits of solvable linear groups

  Let $V$ be a faithful $G$-module for a finite group $G$ and let $p$ be aprime dividing $|G|$. An orbit $v^G$ for the action of $G$ on $V$ is$p$-regular if $|v^G|_p=|G:\bC_G(v)|_p=|G|_p$. Zhang asks the followingquestion in \cite{Zhang}. Assume that a finite solvable group $G$ actsfaithfully and irreducibly on a vector space $V$ over a finite field $\FF$. If$G$ has a $p$-regular orbit for every prime $p$ dividing $|G|$, is it true that$G$ will have a regular orbit on $V$? In \cite{LuCao}, L\"{u} and Cao constructan example showing that the answer to this question is no, however the exampleitself is not correct. In this paper, we study Zhang's question in detail. Weconstruct examples showing that the answer to this question is no in general.We also prove the following result. Assume a finite solvable group $G$ of oddorder acts faithfully and irreducibly on a vector space $V$ over a field of oddcharacteristic. If $G$ has a $p$-regular orbit for every prime $p$ dividing$|G|$, then $G$ will have a regular orbit on $V$.

Direct Imaging of Graphene Edges: Atomic Structure and Electronic  Scattering

  We report an atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)investigation of the edges of graphene grains synthesized on Cu foils bychemical vapor deposition (CVD). Most of the edges are macroscopically parallelto the zigzag directions of graphene lattice. These edges have microscopicroughness that is found to also follow zigzag directions at atomic scale,displaying many ~120 degree turns. A prominent standing wave pattern withperiodicity ~3a/4 (a being the graphene lattice constant) is observed near arare-occurring armchair-oriented edge. Observed features of this wave patternare consistent with the electronic intervalley backscattering predicted tooccur at armchair edges but not at zigzag edges.

Observation of Quantized Hall Effect and Shubnikov-de Hass Oscillations  in Highly Doped Bi2Se3: Evidence for Layered Transport of Bulk Carriers

  Bi2Se3 is an important semiconductor thermoelectric material and a prototypetopological insulator. Here we report observation of Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH)oscillations accompanied by quantized Hall resistances (Rxy) in highly-dopedn-type Bi2Se3 with bulk carrier concentrations of few 10^19 cm^-3. Measurementsunder tilted magnetic fields show that the magnetotransport is 2D-like, whereonly the c-axis component of the magnetic field controls the Landau levelformation. The quantized step size in 1/Rxy is found to scale with the samplethickness, and average ~e2/h per quintuple layer (QL). We show that theobserved magnetotransport features do not come from the sample surface, butarise from the bulk of the sample acting as many parallel 2D electron systemsto give a multilayered quantum Hall effect. Besides revealing a new electronicproperty of Bi2Se3, our finding also has important implications for electronictransport studies of topological insulator materials.

Dark state cooling of a trapped ion using microwave coupling

  We propose a new dark-state cooling method of trapped ion systems in theLamb-Dicke limit. With application of microwave dressing the ion, we can obtaintwo electromagnetically induced transparency structures. The heating effectscaused by the carrier and the blue sideband transition vanish due to the EITeffects and the final mean phonon numbers can be much less than the recoillimit. Our scheme is robust to fluctuations of microwave power and laserintensities which provides a broad cooling bandwidth to cool motional modes ofa linear ion chain. Moreover, it is more suitable to cool four-level ions on alarge-scale ion chip.

Dynamics of cold pulses induced by super-sonic molecular beam injection  in the EAST tokamak

  Evolution of electron temperature, electron density and its fluctuation withhigh spatial and temporal resolutions are presented for the cold pulsepropagation induced by super-sonic molecular beam injection (SMBI) in ohmicplasmas in the EAST tokamak. The non-local heat transport occurs for dischargeswith plasma current $I_p$=450 kA ($q_{95}\sim5.55$), and electron density$n_{e0}$ below a critical value of$(1.35\pm0.25)\times10^{19}~\mathrm{m^{-3}}$. In contrary to the response ofcore electron temperature and electron density (roughly 10 ms after SMBI), theelectron density fluctuation in the plasma core increases promptly after SMBIand reaches its maximum around 15 ms after SMBI. The electron densityfluctuation in the plasma core begins to decrease before the core electrontemperature reaches its maximum (roughly 30 ms). It was also observed that theturbulence perpendicular velocity close to the inversion point of thetemperature perturbation changes sign after SMBI.

Topological insulator Bi2Te3 films synthesized by metal organic chemical  vapor deposition

  Topological insulator (TI) materials such as Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 have attractedstrong recent interests. Large scale, high quality TI thin films are importantfor developing TI-based device applications. In this work, structural andelectronic properties of Bi2Te3 thin films deposited by metal organic chemicalvapor deposition (MOCVD) on GaAs (001) substrates were characterized via X-raydiffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy (ARPES), and electronic transport measurements. The characteristictopological surface states (SS) with a single Dirac cone have been clearlyrevealed in the electronic band structure measured by ARPES, confirming the TInature of the MOCVD Bi2Te3 films. Resistivity and Hall effect measurements havedemonstrated relatively high bulk carrier mobility of ~350 cm^2/Vs at 300K and~7,400 cm^2/Vs at 15 K. We have also measured the Seebeck coefficient of thefilms. Our demonstration of high quality topological insulator films grown by asimple and scalable method is of interests for both fundamental research andpractical applications of thermoelectric and TI materials.

Structural and electronic properties of highly doped topological  insulator Bi2Se3 crystals

  We present a study of the structural and electronic properties of highlydoped topological insulator Bi2Se3 single crystals synthesized by the Bridgmanmethod. Lattice structural characterizations by X-ray diffraction, scanningtunneling microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the high quality of theas-grown single crystals. The topological surface states in the electronic bandstructure were directly re- vealed by angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy. Transport measurements showed that the conduction was dominatedby the bulk carriers and confirmed a previously observed bulk quantum Halleffect in such highly doped Bi2Se3 samples. We briefly discuss several possiblestrategies of reducing bulk conductance.

Dirac semimetal phase in the hexagonal LiZnBi

  Based on first-principles calculations, we find that LiZnBi, a metallichexagonal $ABC$ compound, can be driven into a Dirac semimetal with a pair ofDirac points by strain. The nontrivial topological nature of the strainedLiZnBi is directly demonstrated by calculating its $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and thesurface states, where the Fermi arcs are clearly observed. The low-energystates as well as topological properties are shown to be sensitive to thestrain configurations. The finding of Dirac semimetal phase in LiZnBi mayintrigue further researches on the topological properties of hexagonal $ABC$materials and promote new practical applications.

Unsupervised Diverse Colorization via Generative Adversarial Networks

  Colorization of grayscale images has been a hot topic in computer vision.Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match theoriginal one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an inputgrayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. Inthis paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization.Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to modelthe distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fullyconvolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, withmulti-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 tokeep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the modelyields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. TheTuring test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes arehighly convincible.

Study on Timing Performance of a Readout Circuit for SiPM

  In recent years, SiPM photoelectric devices have drawn much attention in thedomain of time-of-flight-based positron emission tomography (TOF-PET). Usingthem to construct PET detectors with excellent coincidence time resolution(CTR) is always one of research focus. In this paper, a SiPM readoutpre-amplifier based on common-base current amplifier structure followed by aPole-Zero (PZ) compensation network is constructed, and the main factors thataffect the timing performance of the PET detector are investigated. Byexperimental measurement, we found that the CTR is heavily related to thebandwidth of the amplifier, bias voltage of SiPM, comparator threshold, and PZnetwork parameter. The test setup has two detectors, one with LYSO crystal (3mm 3 mm 10 mm) coupled with a Hamamatsu SiPM (S12642-0404), and the other withLaBr3 coupled to a PMT-R9800. After the optimization of the readout circuitwith related factors, the CTR between the two detectors is measured as 266psFWHM. The test result is a helpful guideline for the readout ASIC chip designin our next step.

Control and Characterization of Individual Grains and Grain Boundaries  in Graphene Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition

  The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of highquality graphene and graphene devices. Since large-scale graphene filmssynthesized to date are typically polycrystalline, it is important tocharacterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degradegraphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized byambient CVD on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries betweencoalescing grains affect graphene's electronic properties. The graphene grainsshow no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cugrain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantlyparallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significantRaman "D" peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weaklocalization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene. Finally, wedemonstrate an approach using pre-patterned growth seeds to control graphenenucleation, opening a route towards scalable fabrication of single-crystalgraphene devices without grain boundaries.

Differential measurement of atmospheric refraction with a telescope with  double fields of view

  For the sake of complete theoretical research of atmospheric refraction, theatmospheric refraction under the condition of lower angles of elevation isstill worthy to be analyzed and explored. In some engineering applications, theobjects with larger zenith distance must be observed sometimes. Carrying outobservational research of the atmospheric refraction at lower angles ofelevation has an important significance. It has been considered difficult tomeasure the atmospheric refraction at lower angles of elevation. A new idea fordetermining atmospheric refraction by utilizing differential measurement withdouble fields of view is proposed. Taking the observational principle ofHIPPARCOS satellite as a reference, a schematic prototype with double fields ofview was developed. In August of 2013, experimental observations were carriedout and the atmospheric refractions at lower angles of elevation can beobtained by the schematic prototype. The measured value of the atmosphericrefraction at the zenith distance of 78.8 degree is $240.23"\pm0.27"$, and thefeasibility of differential measurement of atmospheric refraction with doublefields of view was justified. The limitations of the schematic prototype suchas inadequate ability of gathering light, lack of accurate meteorological datarecording and lower automatic level of observation and data processing werealso pointed out, which need to be improved in subsequent work.

Valley-dependent Exciton Fine Structure and Autler-Townes Doublets from  Berry Phases in Monolayer Molybdenum Diselenide

  The Berry phase of Bloch states can have profound effects on electrondynamics lead to novel transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall effectand the valley Hall effect. Recently, it was predicted that the Berry phaseeffect can also modify the exciton states in transition metal dichalcogenidemonolayers, and lift the energy degeneracy of exciton states with oppositeangular momentum through an effective valley-orbital coupling. Here, we reportthe first observation and control of the Berry-phase induced splitting of the2p-exciton states in monolayer molybdenum diselenide using the intraexcitonoptical Stark spectroscopy. We observe the time-reversal-symmetric analog ofthe orbital Zeeman effect resulting from the valley-dependent Berry phase,which leads to energy difference of +14 (-14) meV between the $2p^+$ and $2p^-$exciton states in +K (-K) valley, consistent with the ordering from our abinitio GW-BSE results. In addition, we show that the light-matter couplingbetween intraexciton states are remarkably strong, leading to prominentvalley-dependent Autler-Townes doublet under resonant driving. Our study opensup new pathways to coherently manipulate the quantum states and excitonicexcitation with infrared radiation in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Entanglement-based quantum key distribution with biased basis choice via  free space

  We report a free-space entanglement-based quantum key distributionexperiment, implementing the biased basis protocol between two sites which are15.3 km apart. Photon pairs from a polarization-entangled source aredistributed through two 7.8-km free-space optical links. An optimal bias 20:80between the X and Z basis is used. A post-processing scheme with finite-keyanalysis is applied to extract the final secure key. After three-hourcontinuous operation at night, a 4293-bit secure key is obtained, with a finalkey rate of 0.124 bit per raw key bit which increases the final key rate by14.8% comparing to the standard BB84 case. Our results experimentallydemonstrate that the efficient BB84 protocol, which increases key generationefficiency by biasing Alice and Bob's basis choices, is potentially useful forthe ground-satellite quantum communication.

Controlling and distinguishing electronic transport of topological and  trivial surface states in a topological insulator

  Topological insulators (TI), with characteristic Dirac-fermion topologicalsurface states (TSS), have emerged as a new class of electronic materials withrich potentials for both novel physics and device applications. However, amajor challenge with realistic TI materials is to access, distinguish andmanipulate the electronic transport of TSS often obscured by other possibleparallel conduction channels that include the bulk as well as a two-dimensionalelectron gas (2DEG) formed near the surface due to bending of the bulk bands.Such a (Schrodinger-fermion) 2DEG represents topologically-trivial surfacestates, whose coexistence with the TSS has been revealed by angle resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy. Here we show that simple manipulations of surfaceconditions can be used to access and control both types of surface states andtheir coexistence in bulk-insulating Bi2Te2Se, whose surface conduction isprominently manifested in temperature dependent resistance and nonlocaltransport. The trivial 2DEG and TSS can both exhibit clear Shubnikov-de Haasoscillations in magnetoresistance, with different Berry phases ~0 and ~pi thatdistinguish their different topological characters. We also report a deviationfrom the typical weak antilocalization behavior, possibly due to high mobilityTSS. Our study enables distinguishing, controlling and harnessing electronictransport of TI surface carriers with different topological natures.

Decoupling of the Antiferromagnetic and Insulating States in Tb doped  Sr2IrO4

  Sr2IrO4 is a spin-orbit coupled insulator with an antiferromagnetic (AFM)transition at TN=240 K. We report results of a comprehensive study ofsingle-crystal Sr2Ir1-xTbxO4. This study found that mere 3% (x=0.03)tetravalent Tb4+(4f7) substituting for Ir4+ (rather than Sr2+) completelysuppresses the long-range collinear AFM transition but retains the insulatingstate, leading to a phase diagram featuring a decoupling of magneticinteractions and charge gap. The insulating state at x=0.03 is characterized byan unusually large specific heat at low temperatures and an incommensuratemagnetic state having magnetic peaks at (0.95, 0, 0) and (0, 0.95, 0) in theneutron diffraction, suggesting a spiral or spin density wave order. It isapparent that Tb doping effectively changes the relative strength of the SOIand the tetragonal CEF and enhances the Hund's rule coupling that competes withthe SOI, and destabilizes the AFM state. However, the disappearance of the AFMaccompanies no metallic state chiefly because an energy level mismatch for theIr and Tb sites weakens charge carrier hopping and renders a persistentinsulating state. This work highlights an unconventional correlation betweenthe AFM and insulating states in which the magnetic transition plays nocritical role in the formation of the charge gap in the iridate.

Towards Chip-on-Chip Neuroscience: Fast Mining of Frequent Episodes  Using Graphics Processors

  Computational neuroscience is being revolutionized with the advent ofmulti-electrode arrays that provide real-time, dynamic, perspectives into brainfunction. Mining event streams from these chips is critical to understandingthe firing patterns of neurons and to gaining insight into the underlyingcellular activity. We present a GPGPU solution to mining spike trains. We focuson mining frequent episodes which captures coordinated events across time evenin the presence of intervening background/"junk" events. Our algorithmiccontributions are two-fold: MapConcatenate, a new computation-to-core mappingscheme, and a two-pass elimination approach to quickly find supported episodesfrom a large number of candidates. Together, they help realize a real-time"chip-on-chip" solution to neuroscience data mining, where one chip (themulti-electrode array) supplies the spike train data and another (the GPGPU)mines it at a scale unachievable previously. Evaluation on both synthetic andreal datasets demonstrate the potential of our approach.

Accelerator-Oriented Algorithm Transformation for Temporal Data Mining

  Temporal data mining algorithms are becoming increasingly important in manyapplication domains including computational neuroscience, especially theanalysis of spike train data. While application scientists have been able toreadily gather multi-neuronal datasets, analysis capabilities have laggedbehind, due to both lack of powerful algorithms and inaccessibility to powerfulhardware platforms. The advent of GPU architectures such as Nvidia's GTX 280offers a cost-effective option to bring these capabilities to theneuroscientist's desktop. Rather than port existing algorithms onto thisarchitecture, we advocate the need for algorithm transformation, i.e.,rethinking the design of the algorithm in a way that need not necessarilymirror its serial implementation strictly. We present a novel implementation ofa frequent episode discovery algorithm by revisiting "in-the-large" issues suchas problem decomposition as well as "in-the-small" issues such as data layoutsand memory access patterns. This is non-trivial because frequent episodediscovery does not lend itself to GPU-friendly data-parallel mappingstrategies. Applications to many datasets and comparisons to CPU as well asprior GPU implementations showcase the advantages of our approach.

Graphene Induced Surface Reconstruction of Cu

  An atomic-scale study utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) inultrahigh vacuum (UHV) is performed on large single crystalline graphene grainssynthesized on Cu foil by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Afterthermal annealing, we observe the presence of periodic surface depressions(stripe patterns) that exhibit long-range order formed in the area of Cucovered by graphene. We suggest that the observed stripe pattern is a Cusurface reconstruction formed by partial dislocations (which appeared to bestair-rod-like) resulting from the strain induced by the graphene overlayer. Inaddition, these graphene grains are shown to be more decoupled from the Cusubstrate compared to previously studied grains that exhibited Moir\'epatterns.

Bounding the speed of `spooky action at a distance'

  In the well-known EPR paper, Einstein et al. called the nonlocal correlationin quantum entanglement as `spooky action at a distance'. If the spooky actiondoes exist, what is its speed? All previous experiments along this directionhave locality loopholes and thus can be explained without having to invoke any`spooky action' at all. Here, we strictly closed the locality loopholes byobserving a 12-hour continuous violation of Bell inequality and concluded thatthe lower bound speed of `spooky action' was four orders of magnitude of thespeed of light if the Earth's speed in any inertial reference frame was lessthan 10^(-3) times of the speed of light.

Synthetic Graphene Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition on Copper Foils

  The discovery of graphene, a single layer of covalently bonded carbon atoms,has attracted intense interests. Initial studies using mechanically exfoliatedgraphene unveiled its remarkable electronic, mechanical and thermal properties.There has been a growing need and rapid development in large-area deposition ofgraphene film and its applications. Chemical vapour deposition on copper hasemerged as one of the most promising methods in obtaining large-scale graphenefilms with quality comparable to exfoliated graphene. In this chapter, wereview the synthesis and characterizations of graphene grown on copper foilsubstrates by atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition. We also discusspotential applications of such large scale synthetic graphene.

Quantum Hall Effects in Monolayer-Bilayer Graphene Planar Junctions

  The Hall resistance of a homogeneous electron system is well known to beanti-symmetric with respect to the magnetic field and the sign of chargecarriers. We have observed that such symmetries no longer hold in planar hybridstructures consisting of partly single layer graphene (SLG) and partly bilayergraphene (BLG) in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. In particular, the Hallresistance (R12xy) across the SLG and BLG interface is observed to exhibitquantized plateaus that switch between those characteristic of SLG QH statesand BLG QH states when either the sign of the charge carriers (controlled by aback gate) or the direction of the magnetic field is reversed. Simultaneouslyreversing both the carrier type and the magnetic field gives rise to the samequantized Hall resistances. The observed SLG-BLG interface QH states, withcharacteristic asymmetries with respect to the signs of carriers and magneticfield, are determined only by the chirality of the QH edge states and can beexplained by a Landauer-B\"uttiker analysis applied to such graphene hybridstructures involving two regions of different Landau level (LL) structures.

Efficient Interlayer Relaxation and Transition of Excitons in Epitaxial  and Non-epitaxial MoS2/WS2 Heterostructures

  Semiconductor heterostructures provide a powerful platform for theengineering of excitons. Here we report the excitonic properties oftwo-dimensional (2D) heterostructures that consist of monolayer MoS2 and WS2stacked epitaxially or non-epitaxially in the vertical direction. We findsimilarly efficient interlayer relaxation and transition of excitons in boththe epitaxial and nonepitaxial heterostructures. This is manifested by a twoorders of magnitude decrease in the photoluminescence and the appearance of anextra absorption peak at low energy region. The MoS2/WS2 heterostructures showweak interlayer coupling and can essentially act as atomicscale heterojunctionswith the intrinsic bandstructures of the two monolayers largely preserved. Theyare particularly promising for the applications that request efficientdissociation of excitons and strong light absorption, including photovoltaics,solar fuels, photodetectors, and optical modulators. Our results also indicatethat 2D heterostructures promise unprecedented capabilities to engineerexcitons from the atomic level without concerns of interfacial imperfection.

Stable two-dimensional dumbbell stanene: a quantum spin Hall insulator

  We predict from first-principles calculations a novel structure of stanenewith dumbbell units (DB), and show that it is a two-dimensional topologicalinsulator with inverted band gap which can be tuned by compressive strain.Furthermore, we propose that the boron nitride sheet and reconstructed($2\times2$) InSb(111) surfaces are ideal substrates for the experimentalrealization of DB stanene, maintaining its non-trivial topology. Combined withstandard semiconductor technologies, such as magnetic doping and electricalgating, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, Chern half metallicity andtopological superconductivity can be realized in DB stanene on thosesubstrates. These properties make the two-dimensional supported stanene a goodplatform for the study of new quantum spin Hall insulator as well as otherexotic quantum states of matter.

Error Threshold of Fully Random Eigen Model

  Species evolution is essentially a random process of interaction betweenbiological populations and their environments. As a result, some physicalparameters in evolution models are subject to statistical fluctuations. In thispaper, two important parameters in the Eigen model, the fitness and mutationrate, are treated as Gaussian distributed random variables simultaneously toexamine the property of the error threshold. Numerical simulation results showthat the error threshold in the fully random model appears as a crossoverregion instead of a phase transition point, and as the fluctuation strengthincreases the crossover region becomes smoother and smoother. Furthermore, itis shown that the randomization of the mutation rate plays a dominant role inchanging the error threshold in the fully random model, which is consistentwith the existing experimental data. The implication of the threshold changedue to the randomization for antiviral strategies is discussed.

A magnetic model for low/hard state of black hole binaries

  A magnetic model for low/hard state (LHS) of black hole X-ray binaries(BHXBs),H1743-322 and GX 339-4, is proposed based on the transportation ofmagnetic field from a companion into an accretion disk around a black hole(BH). This model consists of a truncated thin disk with an inneradvection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The spectral profiles of the sourcesare fitted in agreement with the data observed at four different datescorresponding to the rising phase of the LHS. In addition, the association ofthe LHS with quasi-steady jet is modelled based on transportation of magneticfield, where the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) and Blandford-Payne (BP) processes areinvoked to drive the jets from BH and inner ADAF. It turns out that the steepradio/X-ray correlations observed in H1743-322 and GX 339-4 can be interpretedbased on our model.

Classical analog of Stückelberg interferometry with two coupled  mechanical resonators

  Coupled nanomechanical resonators have recently attracted much attention forboth fundamental studies in physics and broad applications in high-precessiondetection or sensing. By studying the Landau-Zener transitions and Rabioscillation of two coupled resonators, it has been shown that such a two-modesystem acts as a classical two-level system bearing the analog to a quantummechanical two-level one. Here we construct a St\"uckelberg interferometer withtwo coupled cantilevers by driving the system through the avoided crossingtwice. By measuring the non-adiabatic phase acquired at the Landau-Zenertransition, we unveil an in-depth analog between the two-mode and quantumtwo-level systems. Our study opens up new opportunities for constructinginterferometers with classical devices.

Effective mass sensing using optomechanically induced transparency in  microresonator system

  Detecting and weighing the individual nanoparticles is an important approachto study the behavior and properties of single particles. Here we illustrate aneffective mass sensing scheme using optomechanical resonator system. Based onthe optomechanically induced transparency phenomenon, a Stokes field referenceapproach is used to sense the mass of the particle on the microresonator. Thefield intensity of the transmission field will be changed by the effect of theparticle which avoids the limits of decay induced spectral width in theresonance shift detection. Exploiting the perturbation method, we theoreticallyevaluated the dynamical behavior of the system, and achieved the femtogramlevel mass sensing without the need for high cavity Q-value, and strongcoupling strength in the optomechanically system.

In-Situ Monitoring of Thermal Annealing Induced Evolution in Film  Morphology and Film-Substrate Bonding in a Monolayer MoS2 Film

  We perform in-situ two-cycle thermal cycling and annealing studies for atransferred CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 on a SiO2/Si substrate, using spatiallyresolved micro-Raman and PL spectroscopy. After the thermal cycling and beingannealed at 305 deg C twice, the film morphology and film-substrate bonding aresignificantly modified, which together with the removal of polymer residuescause major changes in the strain and doping distribution over the film, andthus the optical properties. Before annealing, the strain associated withripples in the transferred film dominates the spatial distributions of the PLpeak position and intensity over the film; after annealing, the variation infilm-substrate bonding, affecting both strain and doping, becomes the leadingfactor. This work reveals that the film-substrate bonding, and thus the strainand doping, is unstable under thermal stress, which is important forunderstanding the substrate effects on the optical and transport properties ofthe 2D material and their impact on device applications.

An improved immersed finte element particle-in-cell method for plasma  simulation

  The particle-in-cell (PIC) method has been widely used for plasma simulation,because of its noise-reduction capability and moderate computational cost. Theimmersed finite element (IFE) method is efficient for solving interfaceproblems on Cartesian meshes, which is desirable for PIC method. Thecombination of these two methods provides an effective tool for plasmasimulation with complex interface/boundary. This paper introduces an improvedIFE-PIC method that enhances the performance in both IFE and PIC aspects. Forthe electric field solver, we adopt the newly developed partially penalized IFEmethod with enhanced accuracy. For PIC implementation, we introduce a newinterpolation technique to ensure the conservation of the charge. Numericalexamples are provided to demonstrate the features of the improved IFE-PICmethod.

Classical dynamical localization in a strongly driven two-mode  mechanical system

  We report the realization of dynamical localization in a strongly driventwo-mode optomechanical system consisting of two coupled cantilevers. Due tothe coupling, mechanical oscillations can transport between the cantilevers.However, by placing one of the cantilevers inside a harmonically oscillatingoptical trap, we demonstrate that mechanical oscillations become tightlybounded to the isolated cantilevers rather than propagate away at specificdriving parameters. The effect of dynamical localization is employed to inducea conductor-to-insulator-like transition in the two-mode mechanical system,which opens up new possibilities for further coherent control of transportphenomena in coupled-mechanical-resonator based lattice.

Collaborative Filtering with Graph-based Implicit Feedback

  Introducing consumed items as users' implicit feedback in matrixfactorization (MF) method, SVD++ is one of the most effective collaborativefiltering methods for personalized recommender systems. Though powerful, SVD++has two limitations: (i). only user-side implicit feedback is utilized, whereasitem-side implicit feedback, which can also enrich item representations, is notleveraged;(ii). in SVD++, the interacted items are equally weighted whencombining the implicit feedback, which can not reflect user's true preferencesaccurately. To tackle the above limitations, in this paper we proposeGraph-based collaborative filtering (GCF) model, Weighted Graph-basedcollaborative filtering (W-GCF) model and Attentive Graph-based collaborativefiltering (A-GCF) model, which (i). generalize the implicit feedback to itemside based on the user-item bipartite graph; (ii). flexibly learn the weightsof individuals in the implicit feedback hence improve the model's capacity.Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed models outperformstate-of-the-art models.For sparse implicit feedback scenarios, additionalimprovement is further achieved by leveraging the step-two implicit feedbackinformation.

Nuclear Pulse Charge Measurement with a Method of Time over Linear  Threshold

  Time over dynamic threshold (TODT) method, proposed in our previous work, hasbeen successfully used for nuclear pulse charge measurement in PET detectors.It has advantages of strict linearity, large dynamic range, and better energyresolution, but requires a relatively complex circuit to generate specificdynamic threshold. In this paper, we propose to replace the dynamic thresholdby a simpler linearly increasing threshold (called as TOLT method) with the aimto simplify the threshold generation circuit meanwhile maintaining its highenergy resolution. Mathematical analysis on this replacement and the relatedrealization circuit are presented. By energy spectrum measurement of PETdetectors, the method is evaluated. The energy resolutions of PET detectors,composed of a PMT coupled with LYSO and LaBr3 crystal, are measured as 12.54%and 5.18% respectively, which is equivalent to the result obtained by TODTmethod. The test results show that the TOLT method is more practicable forcharge measurement of nuclear detectors.

Adversarial Learning with Local Coordinate Coding

  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) aim to generate realistic data fromsome prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian noises). However, such priordistribution is often independent of real data and thus may lose semanticinformation (e.g., geometric structure or content in images) of data. Inpractice, the semantic information might be represented by some latentdistribution learned from data, which, however, is hard to be used for samplingin GANs. In this paper, rather than sampling from the pre-defined priordistribution, we propose a Local Coordinate Coding (LCC) based sampling methodto improve GANs. We derive a generalization bound for LCC based GANs and provethat a small dimensional input is sufficient to achieve good generalization.Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed method.

Dual Reconstruction Nets for Image Super-Resolution with Gradient  Sensitive Loss

  Deep neural networks have exhibited promising performance in imagesuper-resolution (SR) due to the power in learning the non-linear mapping fromlow-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, most deeplearning methods employ feed-forward architectures, and thus the dependenciesbetween LR and HR images are not fully exploited, leading to limited learningperformance. Moreover, most deep learning based SR methods apply the pixel-wisereconstruction error as the loss, which, however, may fail to capturehigh-frequency information and produce perceptually unsatisfying results,whilst the recent perceptual loss relies on some pre-trained deep model andthey may not generalize well. In this paper, we introduce a mask to separatethe image into low- and high-frequency parts based on image gradient magnitude,and then devise a gradient sensitive loss to well capture the structures in theimage without sacrificing the recovery of low-frequency content. Moreover, byinvestigating the duality in SR, we develop a dual reconstruction network (DRN)to improve the SR performance. We provide theoretical analysis on thegeneralization performance of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness andsuperiority with thorough experiments.

Geometric energy transfer in a Stückelberg interferometer of two  parametrically coupled mechanical modes

  Geometric phase, which is acquired after a system undergoing cyclic evolutionin the Hilbert space, is believed to be noise-resilient because it depends onlyon the global properties of the evolution path. Here, we report geometriccontrol of energy transfer between two parametrically coupled mechanical modesin an optomechanical system. The parametric pump is controlled along a closedloop to implement geometric St\"uckelberg interferometry of mechanical motion,in which the dynamical phase is eliminated using the Hahn-echo technique. Wedemonstrate that the interference based solely on the geometric phase is robustagainst certain noises. And, more remarkably, we show that the all-geometricapproach can achieve a high energy-transfer rate that is comparable to thoseusing conventional dynamical protocols.

A simplified finite volume lattice Boltzmann method for simulations of  fluid flows from laminar to turbulent regime, Part I: Numerical framework and  its application to laminar flow simulation

  In this paper, a finite volume lattice Boltzmann method (FVLBM) based oncell-center unstructured girds is presented and full studied to simulate theincompressible laminar flows, which is simple modified from the cell-vertexunstructured girds FVLBM proposed by Stiebler et al. [Computers & Fluids, 2006,35(8): 814-819]. Compared with other complex flux reconstruct methods, thecomputational cost of present scheme is little and can achieve second-orderspatial accuracy, the temporal accuracy is adjustable depending on the temporaldiscretization methods. Different boundary conditions are illustrated and easyimplement to the complex geometries. Four cases are testified to validate thepresent method, including one plate driven Couette flow for accuracy test, flowin the square cavity, flow over the single circular cylinder and more complexdouble circular cylinders. Numerical experiments show that the present schemecan use relatively few grid cells to simulate relatively higher Reynolds numberflow, steady and unsteady flows, demonstrate the good capability of the presentmethod.

Cross-task learning for audio tagging, sound event detection and spatial  localization: DCASE 2019 baseline systems

  The Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2019challenge focuses on audio tagging, sound event detection and spatiallocalisation. DCASE 2019 consists of five tasks: 1) acoustic sceneclassification, 2) audio tagging with noisy labels and minimal supervision, 3)sound event localisation and detection, 4) sound event detection in domesticenvironments, and 5) urban sound tagging. In this paper, we propose genericcross-task baseline systems based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Themotivation is to investigate the performance of a variety of models acrossseveral tasks without exploiting the specific characteristics of the tasks. Welook at CNNs with 5, 9, and 13 layers, and find that the optimal architectureis task-dependent. For the systems we considered, we found that the 9-layer CNNwith average pooling is a good model for a majority of the DCASE 2019 tasks.

Large-scale Graphitic Thin Films Synthesized on Ni and Transferred to  Insulators: Structural and Electronic Properties

  We present a comprehensive study of the structural and electronic propertiesof ultrathin films containing graphene layers synthesized by chemical vapordeposition (CVD) based surface segregation on polycrystalline Ni foils thentransferred onto insulating SiO2/Si substrates. Films of size up to severalmm's have been synthesized. Structural characterizations by atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), cross-sectionaltransmission electron microscopy (XTEM) and Raman spectroscopy confirm thatsuch large scale graphitic thin films (GTF) contain both thick graphite regionsand thin regions of few layer graphene. The films also contain many wrinkles,with sharply-bent tips and dislocations revealed by XTEM, yielding insights onthe growth and buckling processes of the GTF. Measurements on mm-scaleback-gated transistor devices fabricated from the transferred GTF showambipolar field effect with resistance modulation ~50% and carrier mobilitiesreaching ~2000 cm^2/Vs. We also demonstrate quantum transport of carriers withphase coherence length over 0.2 $\mu$m from the observation of 2D weaklocalization in low temperature magneto-transport measurements. Our resultsshow that despite the non-uniformity and surface roughness, such large-scale,flexible thin films can have electronic properties promising for deviceapplications.

LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anticentre (LSS-GAC): the  second release of value-added catalogues

  We present the second release of value-added catalogues of the LAMOSTSpectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anticentre (LSS-GAC DR2). The cataloguespresent values of radial velocity $V_{\rm r}$, atmospheric parameters ---effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity log$g$, metallicity[Fe/H], $\alpha$-element to iron (metal) abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe]([$\alpha$/M]), elemental abundances [C/H] and [N/H], and absolute magnitudes${\rm M}_V$ and ${\rm M}_{K_{\rm s}}$ deduced from 1.8 million spectra of 1.4million unique stars targeted by the LSS-GAC since September 2011 until June2014. The catalogues also give values of interstellar reddening, distance andorbital parameters determined with a variety of techniques, as well as propermotions and multi-band photometry from the far-UV to the mid-IR collected fromthe literature and various surveys. Accuracies of radial velocities reach5kms$^{-1}$ for late-type stars, and those of distance estimates range between10 -- 30 per cent, depending on the spectral signal-to-noise ratios. Precisionsof [Fe/H], [C/H] and [N/H] estimates reach 0.1dex, and those of [$\alpha$/Fe]and [$\alpha$/M] reach 0.05dex. The large number of stars, the contiguous skycoverage, the simple yet non-trivial target selection function and the robustestimates of stellar radial velocities and atmospheric parameters, distancesand elemental abundances, make the catalogues a valuable data set to study thestructure and evolution of the Galaxy, especially the solar-neighbourhood andthe outer disk.

Efficient and Effective Volume Visualization with Enhanced Isosurface  Rendering

  Compared with full volume rendering, isosurface rendering has several wellrecognized advantages in efficiency and accuracy. However, standard isosurfacerendering has some limitations in effectiveness. First, it uses a monotonecolored approach and can only visualize the geometry features of an isosurface.The lack of the capability to illustrate the material property and the internalstructures behind an isosurface has been a big limitation of this method inapplications. Another limitation of isosurface rendering is the difficulty toreveal physically meaningful structures, which are hidden in one or multipleisosurfaces. As such, the application requirements of extract and recombinestructures of interest can not be implemented effectively with isosurfacerendering. In this work, we develop an enhanced isosurface rendering techniqueto improve the effectiveness while maintaining the performance efficiency ofthe standard isosurface rendering. First, an isosurface color enhancementmethod is proposed to illustrate the neighborhood density and to reveal some ofthe internal structures. Second, we extend the structure extraction capabilityof isosurface rendering by enabling explicit scene exploration within a3D-view, using surface peeling, voxel-selecting, isosurface segmentation, andmulti-surface-structure visualization. Our experiments show that the colorenhancement not only improves the visual fidelity of the rendering, but alsoreveals the internal structures without significant increase of thecomputational cost. Explicit scene exploration is also demonstrated as apowerful tool in some application scenarios, such as displaying multipleabdominal organs.

Quantum teleportation and entanglement distribution over 100-kilometre  free-space channels

  A long standing goal for quantum communication is to transfer a quantum stateover arbitrary distances. Free-space quantum communication provides a promisingsolution towards this challenging goal. Here, through a 97-km free spacechannel, we demonstrate long distance quantum teleportation over a 35-53 dBloss one-link channel, and entanglement distribution over a 66-85 dB high-losstwo-link channel. We achieve an average fidelity of {80.4(9)}% for teleportingsix distinct initial states and observe the violation of theClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality after distributing entanglement. Besidesbeing of fundamental interest, our result represents a significant step towardsa global quantum network. Moreover, the high-frequency and high-accuracyacquiring, pointing and tracking technique developed in our experiment providesan essential tool for future satellite-based quantum communication.

Experimental unconditionally secure bit commitment

  Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic task that guarantees a securecommitment between two mutually mistrustful parties and is a building block formany cryptographic primitives, including coin tossing, zero-knowledge proofs,oblivious transfer and secure two-party computation. Unconditionally secure bitcommitment was thought to be impossible until recent theoretical protocols thatcombine quantum mechanics and relativity were shown to elude previousimpossibility proofs. Here we implement such a bit commitment protocol. In theexperiment, the committer performs quantum measurements using two quantum keydistribution systems and the results are transmitted via free-space opticalcommunication to two agents separated with more than 20 km. The security of theprotocol relies on the properties of quantum information and relativity theory.We show that, in each run of the experiment, a bit is successfully committedwith less than 5.68*10^-2 cheating probability. Our result demonstratesunconditionally secure bit commitment and the experimental feasibility ofrelativistic quantum communication.
