Small Representations of Big Kidney Exchange Graphs

  Kidney exchanges are organized markets where patients swap willing butincompatible donors. In the last decade, kidney exchanges grew from small andregional to large and national---and soon, international. This growth resultsin more lives saved, but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the$\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors.State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clearfielded kidney exchanges, but these methods must be tailored to specific modelsand objective functions, and may fail to scale to larger exchanges. In thispaper, we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can beencoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes, the clearingproblem is solvable in polynomial time. We give necessary and sufficientconditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrarycompatibility graph. Then, using real compatibility graphs from the UNOSnationwide kidney exchange, we show how many attributes are needed to encodereal compatibility graphs. The experiments show that, indeed, small numbers ofattributes suffice.

Hardness of the Pricing Problem for Chains in Barter Exchanges

  Kidney exchange is a barter market where patients trade willing but medicallyincompatible donors. These trades occur via cycles, where each patient-donorpair both gives and receives a kidney, and via chains, which begin with analtruistic donor who does not require a kidney in return. For logisticalreasons, the maximum length of a cycle is typically limited to a smallconstant, while chains can be much longer. Given a compatibility graph ofpatient-donor pairs, altruists, and feasible potential transplants betweenthem, finding even a maximum-cardinality set of vertex-disjoint cycles andchains is NP-hard. There has been much work on developing provably optimalsolvers that are efficient in practice. One of the leading techniques has beenbranch and price, where column generation is used to incrementally bring cyclesand chains into the optimization model on an as-needed basis. In particular,only positive-price columns need to be brought into the model. We prove thatfinding a positive-price chain is NP-complete. This shows incorrectness of twoleading branch-and-price solvers that suggested polynomial-time chain pricingalgorithms.

Position-Indexed Formulations for Kidney Exchange

  A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of akidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set ofexchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges tookplace in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving andreceiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without apaired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney inreturn, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while alsodramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing themarket in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains arenot desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety ofreasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain tofail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.  In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges withshort cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to thepractice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three newinteger programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one ofthese models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight asthe previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances inwhich each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwideexchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the UnitedKingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that ournew models are competitive with all existing solvers---in many casesoutperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.

Balancing Lexicographic Fairness and a Utilitarian Objective with  Application to Kidney Exchange

  Balancing fairness and efficiency in resource allocation is a classicaleconomic and computational problem. The price of fairness measures theworst-case loss of economic efficiency when using an inefficient but fairallocation rule; for indivisible goods in many settings, this price isunacceptably high. One such setting is kidney exchange, where needy patientsswap willing but incompatible kidney donors. In this work, we close an openproblem regarding the theoretical price of fairness in modern kidney exchanges.We then propose a general hybrid fairness rule that balances a strictlexicographic preference ordering over classes of agents, and a utilitarianobjective that maximizes economic efficiency. We develop a utility function forthis rule that favors disadvantaged groups lexicographically; but if cost tooverall efficiency becomes too high, it switches to a utilitarian objective.This rule has only one parameter which is proportional to a bound on the priceof fairness, and can be adjusted by policymakers. We apply this rule to realdata from a large kidney exchange and show that our hybrid rule produces morereliable outcomes than other fairness rules.

Learning to Schedule Deadline- and Operator-Sensitive Tasks

  The use of semi-autonomous and autonomous robotic assistants to aid in careof the elderly is expected to ease the burden on human caretakers, withsmall-stage testing already occurring in a variety of countries. Yet, it islikely that these robots will need to request human assistance viateleoperation when domain expertise is needed for a specific task. Asdeployment of robotic assistants moves to scale, mapping these requests forhuman aid to the teleoperators themselves will be a difficult onlineoptimization problem. In this paper, we design a system that allocates requeststo a limited number of teleoperators, each with different specialities, in anonline fashion. We generalize a recent model of online job scheduling with aworst-case competitive-ratio bound to our setting. Next, we design a scalablemachine-learning-based teleoperator-aware task scheduling algorithm and show,experimentally, that it performs well when compared to an omniscient optimalscheduling algorithm.

Diverse Weighted Bipartite b-Matching

  Bipartite matching, where agents on one side of a market are matched toagents or items on the other, is a classical problem in computer science andeconomics, with widespread application in healthcare, education, advertising,and general resource allocation. A practitioner's goal is typically to maximizea matching market's economic efficiency, possibly subject to some fairnessrequirements that promote equal access to resources. A natural balancing actexists between fairness and efficiency in matching markets, and has been thesubject of much research.  In this paper, we study a complementary goal---balancing diversity andefficiency---in a generalization of bipartite matching where agents on one sideof the market can be matched to sets of agents on the other. Adapting aclassical definition of the diversity of a set, we propose a quadraticprogramming-based approach to solving a supermodular minimization problem thatbalances diversity and total weight of the solution. We also provide a scalablegreedy algorithm with theoretical performance bounds. We then define the priceof diversity, a measure of the efficiency loss due to enforcing diversity, andgive a worst-case theoretical bound. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy ofour methods on three real-world datasets, and show that the price of diversityis not bad in practice.

Operation Frames and Clubs in Kidney Exchange

  A kidney exchange is a centrally-administered barter market where patientsswap their willing yet incompatible donors. Modern kidney exchanges use2-cycles, 3-cycles, and chains initiated by non-directed donors (altruists whoare willing to give a kidney to anyone) as the means for swapping.  We propose significant generalizations to kidney exchange. We allow more thanone donor to donate in exchange for their desired patient receiving a kidney.We also allow for the possibility of a donor willing to donate if any of anumber of patients receive kidneys. Furthermore, we combine these notions andgeneralize them. The generalization is to exchange among organ clubs, where aclub is willing to donate organs outside the club if and only if the clubreceives organs from outside the club according to given specifications. Weprove that unlike in the standard model, the uncapped clearing problem isNP-complete.  We also present the notion of operation frames that can be used to sequencethe operations across batches, and present integer programming formulations forthe market clearing problems for these new types of organ exchanges.  Experiments show that in the single-donation setting, operation framesimprove planning by 34%--51%. Allowing up to two donors to donate in exchangefor one kidney donated to their designated patient yields a further increase insocial welfare.

The Diverse Cohort Selection Problem

  How should a firm allocate its limited interviewing resources to select theoptimal cohort of new employees from a large set of job applicants? How shouldthat firm allocate cheap but noisy resume screenings and expensive but in-depthin-person interviews? We view this problem through the lens of combinatorialpure exploration (CPE) in the multi-armed bandit setting, where a centrallearning agent performs costly exploration of a set of arms before selecting afinal subset with some combinatorial structure. We generalize a recent CPEalgorithm to the setting where arm pulls can have different costs and returndifferent levels of information. We then prove theoretical upper bounds for ageneral class of arm-pulling strategies in this new setting. We apply ourgeneral algorithm to a real-world problem with combinatorial structure:incorporating diversity into university admissions. We take real data fromadmissions at one of the largest US-based computer science graduate programsand show that a simulation of our algorithm produces a cohort with hiringoverall utility while spending comparable budget to the current admissionsprocess at that university.

Allocation Problems in Ride-Sharing Platforms: Online Matching with  Offline Reusable Resources

  Bipartite matching markets pair agents on one side of a market with agents,items, or contracts on the opposing side. Prior work addresses online bipartitematching markets, where agents arrive over time and are dynamically matched toa known set of disposable resources. In this paper, we propose a new model,Online Matching with (offline) Reusable Resources under Known AdversarialDistributions (OM-RR-KAD), in which resources on the offline side are reusableinstead of disposable; that is, once matched, resources become available againat some point in the future. We show that our model is tractable by presentingan LP-based adaptive algorithm that achieves an online competitive ratio of 1/2- eps for any given eps greater than 0. We also show that no non-adaptivealgorithm can achieve a ratio of 1/2 + o(1) based on the same benchmark LP.Through a data-driven analysis on a massive openly-available dataset, we showour model is robust enough to capture the application of taxi dispatchingservices and ride-sharing systems. We also present heuristics that perform wellin practice.

Dancing Pigs or Externalities? Measuring the Rationality of Security  Decisions

  Accurately modeling human decision-making in security is critical to thinkingabout when, why, and how to recommend that users adopt certain securebehaviors. In this work, we conduct behavioral economics experiments to modelthe rationality of end-user security decision-making in a realistic onlineexperimental system simulating a bank account. We ask participants to make afinancially impactful security choice, in the face of transparent risks ofaccount compromise and benefits offered by an optional security behavior(two-factor authentication). We measure the cost and utility of adopting thesecurity behavior via measurements of time spent executing the behavior andestimates of the participant's wage. We find that more than 50% of ourparticipants made rational (e.g., utility optimal) decisions, and we find thatparticipants are more likely to behave rationally in the face of higher risk.Additionally, we find that users' decisions can be modeled well as a functionof past behavior (anchoring effects), knowledge of costs, and to a lesserextent, users' awareness of risks and context (R2=0.61). We also find evidenceof endowment effects, as seen in other areas of economic and psychologicaldecision-science literature, in our digital-security setting. Finally, usingour data, we show theoretically that a "one-size-fits"-all emphasis on securitycan lead to market losses, but that adoption by a subset of users with higherrisks or lower costs can lead to market gains.

Scalable Robust Kidney Exchange

  In barter exchanges, participants directly trade their endowed goods in aconstrained economic setting without money. Transactions in barter exchangesare often facilitated via a central clearinghouse that must match participantseven in the face of uncertainty---over participants, existence and quality ofpotential trades, and so on. Leveraging robust combinatorial optimizationtechniques, we address uncertainty in kidney exchange, a real-world bartermarket where patients swap (in)compatible paired donors. We provide twoscalable robust methods to handle two distinct types of uncertainty in kidneyexchange---over the quality and the existence of a potential match. The lattercase directly addresses a weakness in all stochastic-optimization-based methodsto the kidney exchange clearing problem, which all necessarily require explicitestimates of the probability of a transaction existing---a still-unsolvedproblem in this nascent market. We also propose a novel, scalable kidneyexchange formulation that eliminates the need for an exponential-timeconstraint generation process in competing formulations, maintains provableoptimality, and serves as a subsolver for our robust approach. For each type ofuncertainty we demonstrate the benefits of robustness on real data from alarge, fielded kidney exchange in the United States. We conclude by drawingparallels between robustness and notions of fairness in the kidney exchangesetting.

Balancing Relevance and Diversity in Online Bipartite Matching via  Submodularity

  In bipartite matching problems, vertices on one side of a bipartite graph arepaired with those on the other. In its online variant, one side of the graph isavailable offline, while the vertices on the other side arrive online. When avertex arrives, an irrevocable and immediate decision should be made by thealgorithm; either match it to an available vertex or drop it. Examples of suchproblems include matching workers to firms, advertisers to keywords, organs topatients, and so on. Much of the literature focuses on maximizing the totalrelevance---modeled via total weight---of the matching. However, in manyreal-world problems, it is also important to consider contributions ofdiversity: hiring a diverse pool of candidates, displaying a relevant butdiverse set of ads, and so on. In this paper, we propose the Online SubmodularBipartite Matching (\osbm) problem, where the goal is to maximize a submodularfunction $f$ over the set of matched edges. This objective is general enough tocapture the notion of both diversity (\emph{e.g.,} a weighted coveragefunction) and relevance (\emph{e.g.,} the traditional linear function)---aswell as many other natural objective functions occurring in practice(\emph{e.g.,} limited total budget in advertising settings). We propose novelalgorithms that have provable guarantees and are essentially optimal whenrestricted to various special cases. We also run experiments on real-world andsynthetic datasets to validate our algorithms.

Ignorance is Almost Bliss: Near-Optimal Stochastic Matching With Few  Queries

  The stochastic matching problem deals with finding a maximum matching in agraph whose edges are unknown but can be accessed via queries. This is aspecial case of stochastic $k$-set packing, where the problem is to find amaximum packing of sets, each of which exists with some probability. In thispaper, we provide edge and set query algorithms for these two problems,respectively, that provably achieve some fraction of the omniscient optimalsolution.  Our main theoretical result for the stochastic matching (i.e., $2$-setpacking) problem is the design of an \emph{adaptive} algorithm that queriesonly a constant number of edges per vertex and achieves a $(1-\epsilon)$fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, for an arbitrarily small$\epsilon>0$. Moreover, this adaptive algorithm performs the queries in only aconstant number of rounds. We complement this result with a \emph{non-adaptive}(i.e., one round of queries) algorithm that achieves a $(0.5 - \epsilon)$fraction of the omniscient optimum. We also extend both our results tostochastic $k$-set packing by designing an adaptive algorithm that achieves a$(\frac{2}{k} - \epsilon)$ fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, againwith only $O(1)$ queries per element. This guarantee is close to the best knownpolynomial-time approximation ratio of $\frac{3}{k+1} -\epsilon$ for the\emph{deterministic} $k$-set packing problem [Furer and Yu, 2013]  We empirically explore the application of (adaptations of) these algorithmsto the kidney exchange problem, where patients with end-stage renal failureswap willing but incompatible donors. We show on both generated data and onreal data from the first 169 match runs of the UNOS nationwide kidney exchangethat even a very small number of non-adaptive edge queries per vertex resultsin large gains in expected successful matches.
