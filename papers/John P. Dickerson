Hardness of the Pricing Problem for Chains in Barter Exchanges

  Kidney exchange is a barter market where patients trade willing but medically
incompatible donors. These trades occur via cycles, where each patient-donor
pair both gives and receives a kidney, and via chains, which begin with an
altruistic donor who does not require a kidney in return. For logistical
reasons, the maximum length of a cycle is typically limited to a small
constant, while chains can be much longer. Given a compatibility graph of
patient-donor pairs, altruists, and feasible potential transplants between
them, finding even a maximum-cardinality set of vertex-disjoint cycles and
chains is NP-hard. There has been much work on developing provably optimal
solvers that are efficient in practice. One of the leading techniques has been
branch and price, where column generation is used to incrementally bring cycles
and chains into the optimization model on an as-needed basis. In particular,
only positive-price columns need to be brought into the model. We prove that
finding a positive-price chain is NP-complete. This shows incorrectness of two
leading branch-and-price solvers that suggested polynomial-time chain pricing
algorithms.


Small Representations of Big Kidney Exchange Graphs

  Kidney exchanges are organized markets where patients swap willing but
incompatible donors. In the last decade, kidney exchanges grew from small and
regional to large and national---and soon, international. This growth results
in more lives saved, but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors.
State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clear
fielded kidney exchanges, but these methods must be tailored to specific models
and objective functions, and may fail to scale to larger exchanges. In this
paper, we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can be
encoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes, the clearing
problem is solvable in polynomial time. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrary
compatibility graph. Then, using real compatibility graphs from the UNOS
nationwide kidney exchange, we show how many attributes are needed to encode
real compatibility graphs. The experiments show that, indeed, small numbers of
attributes suffice.


Position-Indexed Formulations for Kidney Exchange

  A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a
kidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set of
exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took
place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and
receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a
paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in
return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also
dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the
market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are
not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of
reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to
fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.
  In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with
short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the
practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new
integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of
these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as
the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in
which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide
exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United
Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our
new models are competitive with all existing solvers---in many cases
outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.


Balancing Lexicographic Fairness and a Utilitarian Objective with
  Application to Kidney Exchange

  Balancing fairness and efficiency in resource allocation is a classical
economic and computational problem. The price of fairness measures the
worst-case loss of economic efficiency when using an inefficient but fair
allocation rule; for indivisible goods in many settings, this price is
unacceptably high. One such setting is kidney exchange, where needy patients
swap willing but incompatible kidney donors. In this work, we close an open
problem regarding the theoretical price of fairness in modern kidney exchanges.
We then propose a general hybrid fairness rule that balances a strict
lexicographic preference ordering over classes of agents, and a utilitarian
objective that maximizes economic efficiency. We develop a utility function for
this rule that favors disadvantaged groups lexicographically; but if cost to
overall efficiency becomes too high, it switches to a utilitarian objective.
This rule has only one parameter which is proportional to a bound on the price
of fairness, and can be adjusted by policymakers. We apply this rule to real
data from a large kidney exchange and show that our hybrid rule produces more
reliable outcomes than other fairness rules.


Learning to Schedule Deadline- and Operator-Sensitive Tasks

  The use of semi-autonomous and autonomous robotic assistants to aid in care
of the elderly is expected to ease the burden on human caretakers, with
small-stage testing already occurring in a variety of countries. Yet, it is
likely that these robots will need to request human assistance via
teleoperation when domain expertise is needed for a specific task. As
deployment of robotic assistants moves to scale, mapping these requests for
human aid to the teleoperators themselves will be a difficult online
optimization problem. In this paper, we design a system that allocates requests
to a limited number of teleoperators, each with different specialities, in an
online fashion. We generalize a recent model of online job scheduling with a
worst-case competitive-ratio bound to our setting. Next, we design a scalable
machine-learning-based teleoperator-aware task scheduling algorithm and show,
experimentally, that it performs well when compared to an omniscient optimal
scheduling algorithm.


Diverse Weighted Bipartite b-Matching

  Bipartite matching, where agents on one side of a market are matched to
agents or items on the other, is a classical problem in computer science and
economics, with widespread application in healthcare, education, advertising,
and general resource allocation. A practitioner's goal is typically to maximize
a matching market's economic efficiency, possibly subject to some fairness
requirements that promote equal access to resources. A natural balancing act
exists between fairness and efficiency in matching markets, and has been the
subject of much research.
  In this paper, we study a complementary goal---balancing diversity and
efficiency---in a generalization of bipartite matching where agents on one side
of the market can be matched to sets of agents on the other. Adapting a
classical definition of the diversity of a set, we propose a quadratic
programming-based approach to solving a supermodular minimization problem that
balances diversity and total weight of the solution. We also provide a scalable
greedy algorithm with theoretical performance bounds. We then define the price
of diversity, a measure of the efficiency loss due to enforcing diversity, and
give a worst-case theoretical bound. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of
our methods on three real-world datasets, and show that the price of diversity
is not bad in practice.


Operation Frames and Clubs in Kidney Exchange

  A kidney exchange is a centrally-administered barter market where patients
swap their willing yet incompatible donors. Modern kidney exchanges use
2-cycles, 3-cycles, and chains initiated by non-directed donors (altruists who
are willing to give a kidney to anyone) as the means for swapping.
  We propose significant generalizations to kidney exchange. We allow more than
one donor to donate in exchange for their desired patient receiving a kidney.
We also allow for the possibility of a donor willing to donate if any of a
number of patients receive kidneys. Furthermore, we combine these notions and
generalize them. The generalization is to exchange among organ clubs, where a
club is willing to donate organs outside the club if and only if the club
receives organs from outside the club according to given specifications. We
prove that unlike in the standard model, the uncapped clearing problem is
NP-complete.
  We also present the notion of operation frames that can be used to sequence
the operations across batches, and present integer programming formulations for
the market clearing problems for these new types of organ exchanges.
  Experiments show that in the single-donation setting, operation frames
improve planning by 34%--51%. Allowing up to two donors to donate in exchange
for one kidney donated to their designated patient yields a further increase in
social welfare.


The Diverse Cohort Selection Problem

  How should a firm allocate its limited interviewing resources to select the
optimal cohort of new employees from a large set of job applicants? How should
that firm allocate cheap but noisy resume screenings and expensive but in-depth
in-person interviews? We view this problem through the lens of combinatorial
pure exploration (CPE) in the multi-armed bandit setting, where a central
learning agent performs costly exploration of a set of arms before selecting a
final subset with some combinatorial structure. We generalize a recent CPE
algorithm to the setting where arm pulls can have different costs and return
different levels of information. We then prove theoretical upper bounds for a
general class of arm-pulling strategies in this new setting. We apply our
general algorithm to a real-world problem with combinatorial structure:
incorporating diversity into university admissions. We take real data from
admissions at one of the largest US-based computer science graduate programs
and show that a simulation of our algorithm produces a cohort with hiring
overall utility while spending comparable budget to the current admissions
process at that university.


Allocation Problems in Ride-Sharing Platforms: Online Matching with
  Offline Reusable Resources

  Bipartite matching markets pair agents on one side of a market with agents,
items, or contracts on the opposing side. Prior work addresses online bipartite
matching markets, where agents arrive over time and are dynamically matched to
a known set of disposable resources. In this paper, we propose a new model,
Online Matching with (offline) Reusable Resources under Known Adversarial
Distributions (OM-RR-KAD), in which resources on the offline side are reusable
instead of disposable; that is, once matched, resources become available again
at some point in the future. We show that our model is tractable by presenting
an LP-based adaptive algorithm that achieves an online competitive ratio of 1/2
- eps for any given eps greater than 0. We also show that no non-adaptive
algorithm can achieve a ratio of 1/2 + o(1) based on the same benchmark LP.
Through a data-driven analysis on a massive openly-available dataset, we show
our model is robust enough to capture the application of taxi dispatching
services and ride-sharing systems. We also present heuristics that perform well
in practice.


Dancing Pigs or Externalities? Measuring the Rationality of Security
  Decisions

  Accurately modeling human decision-making in security is critical to thinking
about when, why, and how to recommend that users adopt certain secure
behaviors. In this work, we conduct behavioral economics experiments to model
the rationality of end-user security decision-making in a realistic online
experimental system simulating a bank account. We ask participants to make a
financially impactful security choice, in the face of transparent risks of
account compromise and benefits offered by an optional security behavior
(two-factor authentication). We measure the cost and utility of adopting the
security behavior via measurements of time spent executing the behavior and
estimates of the participant's wage. We find that more than 50% of our
participants made rational (e.g., utility optimal) decisions, and we find that
participants are more likely to behave rationally in the face of higher risk.
Additionally, we find that users' decisions can be modeled well as a function
of past behavior (anchoring effects), knowledge of costs, and to a lesser
extent, users' awareness of risks and context (R2=0.61). We also find evidence
of endowment effects, as seen in other areas of economic and psychological
decision-science literature, in our digital-security setting. Finally, using
our data, we show theoretically that a "one-size-fits"-all emphasis on security
can lead to market losses, but that adoption by a subset of users with higher
risks or lower costs can lead to market gains.


Scalable Robust Kidney Exchange

  In barter exchanges, participants directly trade their endowed goods in a
constrained economic setting without money. Transactions in barter exchanges
are often facilitated via a central clearinghouse that must match participants
even in the face of uncertainty---over participants, existence and quality of
potential trades, and so on. Leveraging robust combinatorial optimization
techniques, we address uncertainty in kidney exchange, a real-world barter
market where patients swap (in)compatible paired donors. We provide two
scalable robust methods to handle two distinct types of uncertainty in kidney
exchange---over the quality and the existence of a potential match. The latter
case directly addresses a weakness in all stochastic-optimization-based methods
to the kidney exchange clearing problem, which all necessarily require explicit
estimates of the probability of a transaction existing---a still-unsolved
problem in this nascent market. We also propose a novel, scalable kidney
exchange formulation that eliminates the need for an exponential-time
constraint generation process in competing formulations, maintains provable
optimality, and serves as a subsolver for our robust approach. For each type of
uncertainty we demonstrate the benefits of robustness on real data from a
large, fielded kidney exchange in the United States. We conclude by drawing
parallels between robustness and notions of fairness in the kidney exchange
setting.


Balancing Relevance and Diversity in Online Bipartite Matching via
  Submodularity

  In bipartite matching problems, vertices on one side of a bipartite graph are
paired with those on the other. In its online variant, one side of the graph is
available offline, while the vertices on the other side arrive online. When a
vertex arrives, an irrevocable and immediate decision should be made by the
algorithm; either match it to an available vertex or drop it. Examples of such
problems include matching workers to firms, advertisers to keywords, organs to
patients, and so on. Much of the literature focuses on maximizing the total
relevance---modeled via total weight---of the matching. However, in many
real-world problems, it is also important to consider contributions of
diversity: hiring a diverse pool of candidates, displaying a relevant but
diverse set of ads, and so on. In this paper, we propose the Online Submodular
Bipartite Matching (\osbm) problem, where the goal is to maximize a submodular
function $f$ over the set of matched edges. This objective is general enough to
capture the notion of both diversity (\emph{e.g.,} a weighted coverage
function) and relevance (\emph{e.g.,} the traditional linear function)---as
well as many other natural objective functions occurring in practice
(\emph{e.g.,} limited total budget in advertising settings). We propose novel
algorithms that have provable guarantees and are essentially optimal when
restricted to various special cases. We also run experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets to validate our algorithms.


Ignorance is Almost Bliss: Near-Optimal Stochastic Matching With Few
  Queries

  The stochastic matching problem deals with finding a maximum matching in a
graph whose edges are unknown but can be accessed via queries. This is a
special case of stochastic $k$-set packing, where the problem is to find a
maximum packing of sets, each of which exists with some probability. In this
paper, we provide edge and set query algorithms for these two problems,
respectively, that provably achieve some fraction of the omniscient optimal
solution.
  Our main theoretical result for the stochastic matching (i.e., $2$-set
packing) problem is the design of an \emph{adaptive} algorithm that queries
only a constant number of edges per vertex and achieves a $(1-\epsilon)$
fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, for an arbitrarily small
$\epsilon>0$. Moreover, this adaptive algorithm performs the queries in only a
constant number of rounds. We complement this result with a \emph{non-adaptive}
(i.e., one round of queries) algorithm that achieves a $(0.5 - \epsilon)$
fraction of the omniscient optimum. We also extend both our results to
stochastic $k$-set packing by designing an adaptive algorithm that achieves a
$(\frac{2}{k} - \epsilon)$ fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, again
with only $O(1)$ queries per element. This guarantee is close to the best known
polynomial-time approximation ratio of $\frac{3}{k+1} -\epsilon$ for the
\emph{deterministic} $k$-set packing problem [Furer and Yu, 2013]
  We empirically explore the application of (adaptations of) these algorithms
to the kidney exchange problem, where patients with end-stage renal failure
swap willing but incompatible donors. We show on both generated data and on
real data from the first 169 match runs of the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange
that even a very small number of non-adaptive edge queries per vertex results
in large gains in expected successful matches.
