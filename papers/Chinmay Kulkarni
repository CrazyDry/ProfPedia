Sparse Regression and Adaptive Feature Generation for the Discovery of  Dynamical Systems

  We study the performance of sparse regression methods and propose newtechniques to distill the governing equations of dynamical systems from data.We first look at the generic methodology of learning interpretable equationforms from data, proposed by Brunton et al., followed by performance of LASSOfor this purpose. We then propose a new algorithm that uses the dual of LASSOoptimization for higher accuracy and stability. In the second part, we proposea novel algorithm that learns the candidate function library in a completelydata-driven manner to distill the governing equations of the dynamical system.This is achieved via sequentially thresholded ridge regression (STRidge) over aorthogonal polynomial space. The performance of the three discussed methods isillustrated by looking the Lorenz 63 system and the quadratic Lorenz system.
