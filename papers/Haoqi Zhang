Performance-driven 3D printing of continuous curved fibre reinforced  polymer composites a preliminary numerical study

  This paper presents a new concept to place continuous curved fibres for CFRPcomposites, which can be fulfilled by potential additive or hybridmanufacturing technology. Based on the loading condition, principal stresstrajectories are generated through finite element analysis (FEA) and used asthe guidance of the placement paths for carbon fibres. Three numerical cases,an open-hole single ply lamina under uniaxial tension and an open-holecross-ply laminate under biaxial tension and normal pressure, are studied andcompared with traditional reinforced composites with unidirectional fibres. Themodelling results show that the stress concentration in both fibre and matrixare reduced significantly by the curved fibre placement and the stiffness ofCFRP composites have been improved. This concept of performance-drivenoptimization method could lead to a useful tool for the design of future 3Dprinting process for fibre reinforced composites.

WeDo: Exploring Participatory, End-To-End Collective Action

  Many celebrate the Internet's ability to connect individuals and facilitatecollective action toward a common goal. While numerous systems have beendesigned to support particular aspects of collective action, few systemssupport participatory, end-to-end collective action in which a crowd orcommunity identifies opportunities, formulates goals, brainstorms ideas,develops plans, mobilizes, and takes action. To explore the possibilities andbarriers in supporting such interactions, we have developed WeDo, a systemaimed at promoting simple forms of participatory, end-to-end collective action.Pilot deployments of WeDo illustrate that sociotechnical systems can supportautomated transitions through different phases of end-to-end collective action,but that challenges, such as the elicitation of leadership and theaccommodation of existing group norms, remain.

Attendee-Sourcing: Exploring The Design Space of Community-Informed  Conference Scheduling

  Constructing a good conference schedule for a large multi-track conferenceneeds to take into account the preferences and constraints of organizers,authors, and attendees. Creating a schedule which has fewer conflicts forauthors and attendees, and thematically coherent sessions is a challengingtask.  Cobi introduced an alternative approach to conference scheduling by engagingthe community to play an active role in the planning process. The current Cobipipeline consists of committee-sourcing and author-sourcing to plan aconference schedule. We further explore the design space of community-sourcingby introducing attendee-sourcing -- a process that collects input fromconference attendees and encodes them as preferences and constraints forcreating sessions and schedule. For CHI 2014, a large multi-track conference inhuman-computer interaction with more than 3,000 attendees and 1,000 authors, wecollected attendees' preferences by making available all the accepted papers atthe conference on a paper recommendation tool we built called Confer, for aperiod of 45 days before announcing the conference program (sessions andschedule). We compare the preferences marked on Confer with the preferencescollected from Cobi's author-sourcing approach. We show that attendee-sourcingcan provide insights beyond what can be discovered by author-sourcing. For CHI2014, the results show value in the method and attendees' participation. Itproduces data that provides more alternatives in scheduling and complementsdata collected from other methods for creating coherent sessions and reducingconflicts.

Neutrino Physics with JUNO

  The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purposeunderground liquid scintillator detector, was proposed with the determinationof the neutrino mass hierarchy as a primary physics goal. It is also capable ofobserving neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, includingsupernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos,atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such asnucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physicsmotivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for variousproposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plantsat 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4sigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrinospectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the sixoscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\%. Neutrino burst from atypical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000inverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elasticscattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable informationon the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrinoenergy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400events per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrinosamples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. protondecay via the $p\to K^++\bar\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will providea unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle andastrophysics. It holds the great potential for further advancing our quest tounderstanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, one of the buildingblocks of our Universe.
