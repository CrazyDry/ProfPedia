A Hybrid Model for Disease Spread and an Application to the SARS  Pandemic

  Pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities andsocieties. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scaledifference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailedmicro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. Thispaper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and localspread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious diseasebetween regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and thespread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model thespread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the globalspread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for thelocal spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out asimulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using availabledata on population, population density, and traffic networks between differentregions. While it is well-known that international relationships and globaltraffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our resultsshow that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatlyimprove the results of modeling disease spread.

Comparing Prediction Market Structures, With an Application to Market  Making

  Ensuring sufficient liquidity is one of the key challenges for designers ofprediction markets. Various market making algorithms have been proposed in theliterature and deployed in practice, but there has been little effort toevaluate their benefits and disadvantages in a systematic manner. We introducea novel experimental design for comparing market structures in live tradingthat ensures fair comparison between two different microstructures with thesame trading population. Participants trade on outcomes related to atwo-dimensional random walk that they observe on their computer screens. Theycan simultaneously trade in two markets, corresponding to the independenthorizontal and vertical random walks. We use this experimental design tocompare the popular inventory-based logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR)market maker and a new information based Bayesian market maker (BMM). Ourexperiments reveal that BMM can offer significant benefits in terms of pricestability and expected loss when controlling for liquidity; the caveat is that,unlike LMSR, BMM does not guarantee bounded loss. Our investigation alsoelucidates some general properties of market makers in prediction markets. Inparticular, there is an inherent tradeoff between adaptability to market shocksand convergence during market equilibrium.

How to show a probabilistic model is better

  We present a simple theoretical framework, and corresponding practicalprocedures, for comparing probabilistic models on real data in a traditionalmachine learning setting. This framework is based on the theory of properscoring rules, but requires only basic algebra and probability theory tounderstand and verify. The theoretical concepts presented are well-studied,primarily in the statistics literature. The goal of this paper is to advocatetheir wider adoption for performance evaluation in empirical machine learning.

Pushing Your Point of View: Behavioral Measures of Manipulation in  Wikipedia

  As a major source for information on virtually any topic, Wikipedia serves animportant role in public dissemination and consumption of knowledge. As aresult, it presents tremendous potential for people to promulgate their ownpoints of view; such efforts may be more subtle than typical vandalism. In thispaper, we introduce new behavioral metrics to quantify the level of controversyassociated with a particular user: a Controversy Score (C-Score) based on theamount of attention the user focuses on controversial pages, and a ClusteredControversy Score (CC-Score) that also takes into account topical clustering.We show that both these measures are useful for identifying people who try to"push" their points of view, by showing that they are good predictors of whicheditors get blocked. The metrics can be used to triage potential POV pushers.We apply this idea to a dataset of users who requested promotion toadministrator status and easily identify some editors who significantly changedtheir behavior upon becoming administrators. At the same time, such behavior isnot rampant. Those who are promoted to administrator status tend to have morestable behavior than comparable groups of prolific editors. This suggests thatthe Adminship process works well, and that the Wikipedia community is notoverwhelmed by users who become administrators to promote their own points ofview.

Near-Optimal Target Learning With Stochastic Binary Signals

  We study learning in a noisy bisection model: specifically, Bayesianalgorithms to learn a target value V given access only to noisy realizations ofwhether V is less than or greater than a threshold theta. At step t = 0, 1, 2,..., the learner sets threshold theta t and observes a noisy realization ofsign(V - theta t). After T steps, the goal is to output an estimate V^ which iswithin an eta-tolerance of V . This problem has been studied, predominantly inenvironments with a fixed error probability q < 1/2 for the noisy realizationof sign(V - theta t). In practice, it is often the case that q can approach1/2, especially as theta -> V, and there is little known when this happens. Wegive a pseudo-Bayesian algorithm which provably converges to V. When the trueprior matches our algorithm's Gaussian prior, we show near-optimal expectedperformance. Our methods extend to the general multiple-threshold setting wherethe observation noisily indicates which of k >= 2 regions V belongs to.

Home Is Where the Up-Votes Are: Behavior Changes in Response to Feedback  in Social Media

  Recent research shows that humans are heavily influenced by online socialinteractions: We are more likely to perform actions which, in the past, haveled to positive social feedback. We introduce a quantitative model of behaviorchanges in response to such feedback, drawing on inverse reinforcement learningand studies of human game playing. The model allows us to make predictions,particularly in the context of social media, about which community a user willselect, and to quantify how future selections change based on the feedback auser receives. We show that our model predicts real-world changes in behavioron a dataset gathered from reddit. We also explore how this relatively simplemodel of individual behavior can lead to complex collective dynamics when thereis a population of users, each individual learning in response to feedback andin turn providing feedback to others.

On Manipulation in Prediction Markets When Participants Influence  Outcomes Directly

  Prediction markets are often used as mechanisms to aggregate informationabout a future event, for example, whether a candidate will win an election.The event is typically assumed to be exogenous. In reality, participants mayinfluence the outcome, and therefore (1) running the prediction market couldchange the incentives of participants in the process that creates the outcome(for example, agents may want to change their vote in an election), and (2)simple results such as the myopic incentive compatibility of proper scoringrules no longer hold in the prediction market itself. We introduce a model ofgames of this kind, where agents first trade in a prediction market and thentake an action that influences the market outcome. Our two-stage two-playermodel, despite its simplicity, captures two aspects of real-world predictionmarkets: (1) agents may directly influence the outcome, (2) some of the agentsinstrumental in deciding the outcome may not take part in the predictionmarket. We show that this game has two different types of perfect Bayesianequilibria, which we term LPP and HPP, depending on the values of the beliefparameters: in the LPP domain, equilibrium prices reveal expected marketoutcomes conditional on the participants' private information, whereas HPPequilibria are collusive -- participants effectively coordinate in anuninformative and untruthful way.
