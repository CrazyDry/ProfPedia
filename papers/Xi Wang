Stability of Gorenstein objects in triangulated categories

  Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a triangulated category with a proper class $\xi$ oftriangles. Asadollahi and Salarian introduced and studied $\xi$-Gorensteinprojective and $\xi$-Gorenstein injective objects, and developed Gorensteinhomological algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we further studyGorenstein homological properties for a triangulated category. First, wediscuss the stability of $\xi$-Gorenstein projective objects, and show that thesubcategory $\mathcal{GP}(\xi)$ of all $\xi$-Gorenstein projective objects hasa strong stability. That is, an iteration of the procedure used to define the$\xi$-Gorenstein projective objects yields exactly the $\xi$-Gorensteinprojective objects. Second, we give some equivalent characterizations for$\xi$-Gorenstein projective dimension of object in $\mathcal{C}$.

Nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations for Probability Measures on Path Space  and Path-Distribution Dependent SDEs

  By investigating path-distribution dependent stochastic differentialequations, the following type of nonlinear Fokker--Planck equations forprobability measures $(\mu_t)_{t \geq 0}$ on the path space $\mathcalC:=C([-r_0,0];\mathbb R^d),$ is analyzed: $$\partial_t\mu(t)=L_{t,\mu_t}^*\mu_t,\ \ t\ge 0,$$ where $\mu(t)$ is the image of $\mu_t$under the projection $\mathcal C\ni\xi\mapsto \xi(0)\in\mathbb R^d$, and$$L_{t,\mu}(\xi):= \frac 1 2\sum_{i,j=1}^d a_{ij}(t,\xi,\mu)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial_{\xi(0)_i} \partial_{\xi(0)_j}}  +\sum_{i=1}^d b_i(t,\xi,\mu)\frac{\partial}{\partial_{\xi(0)_i}},\ \ t\ge 0,\xi\in \mathcal C, \mu\in  \mathcal P^{\mathcal C}.$$ Under reasonable conditions on the coefficients$a_{ij}$ and $b_i$, the existence, uniqueness, Lipschitz continuity inWasserstein distance, total variational norm and entropy, as well as derivativeestimates are derived for the martingale solutions.

Lower Bounds of the Hausdorff dimension for Feller processes

  Let $(X_t)_{t\ge0}$ be a Feller process generated by a pseudo-differentialoperator whose symbol satisfies $\|p(\cdot,\xi)\|_\infty\le c(1+|\xi|^2)$ and$p(\cdot,0)\equiv0.$ We prove that, for a large class of examples, theHausdorff dimension of the set $\{X_t: t\in E\}$ for any analytic set $E\subset[0,\infty)$ is almost surely bounded below by $\betalower \Dh E$, where\begin{align*}  \betalower&:=\sup\left\{\delta>0: \lim_{|\xi|\to \infty}\frac{\inf_{z\in\R^d} \Re p(z,\xi)}{|\xi|^\delta}=\infty\right\}.\end{align*}This, along with the upper bound $ \betaupperstar \Dh E$ with\begin{align*}  \betaupperstar  &:=\inf\left\{\delta>0: \lim_{|\xi|\to \infty}\frac{\sup_{|\eta|\le{|\xi|}}\sup_{z\in\R^d} |p(z,\eta)|}{|\xi|^\delta}=0\right\}  \end{align*} established in B\"{o}ttcher, Schilling and Wang (2014), extendsthe dimension estimates for L\'{e}vy processes of Blumenthal and Getoor (1961)and Millar (1971) to Feller processes.

  In this article, we study the vertexes $\Xi_Q^*\Xi'_Q V$ and $\Sigma_Q^*\Sigma_Q V$ with the light-cone QCD sum rules, then assume the vector mesondominance of the intermediate $\phi(1020)$, $\rho(770)$ and $\omega(782)$, andcalculate the radiative decays $\Xi_Q^*\to \Xi'_Q \gamma$ and $\Sigma_Q^*\to\Sigma_Q \gamma$.

Reanalysis of the heavy baryon states $Ω_b$, $Ω_c$, $Ξ'_b$,  $Ξ'_c$, $Σ_b$ and $Σ_c$ with QCD sum rules

  In this article, we re-study the heavy baryon states $\Omega_b$, $\Omega_c$,$\Xi'_b$, $\Xi'_c$, $\Sigma_b$ and $\Sigma_c$ with the QCD sum rules, aftersubtracting the contributions from the corresponding negative parity heavybaryon states, the predicted masses are in good agreement with the experimentaldata.

Inequalities on generalized matrix functions

  We prove inequalities on non-integer powers of products of generalizedmatrices functions on the sum of positive semi-definite matrices. For example,for any real number $r \in \{1\} \cup [2, \infty)$, positive semi-definitematrices $A_i,\ B_i,\ C_i\in M_{n_i}$, $i=1,2$, and generalized matrixfunctions $d_\chi, d_\xi$ such as the determinant and permanent, etc., we have\begin{eqnarray*}&&\left(d_\chi(A_1+B_1+C_1)d_\xi(A_2+B_2+C_2)\right)^r \\&&\hskip 1in  + \left(d_\chi(A_1)d_\xi(A_2)\right)^r  + \left(d_\chi(B_1)d_\xi(B_2)\right)^r + \left(d_\chi(C_1)d_\xi(C_2)\right)^r\\ & \ge &\left(d_\chi(A_1+B_1 )d_\xi(A_2+B_2 )\right)^r + \left(d_\chi(A_1+C_1)d_\xi(A_2+ C_2)\right)^r + \left(d_\chi( B_1+C_1)d_\xi(B_2+C_2)\right)^r\,.\end{eqnarray*} A general scheme is introduced to provemore general inequalities involving $m$ positive semi-definite matrices for $m\ge 3$ that extend the results of other authors.

A Monte Carlo Study of Single Baryon Reconstruction Method

  A Monte Carlo study for single baryon reconstruction method is presentedbased on two-body baryonic decays of charmonium, $jJ/\psi$,$\psi(3686)\rightarrow\Xi\bar\Xi$ at BESIII experiment. As a result, we findthat the detection efficiency for single baryon reconstruction method can beincreased by a factor of $\sim$4 relative to the traditionalfull-reconstruction method. It indicates that single baryon reconstructionmethod could be used in the other two-body baryonic decays of charmonium, suchas $J/\psi$, $\psi(3686)\rightarrow\Xi(1530)\bar\Xi(1530)$, $\Xi(1530)\bar\Xi$,whose expected yields are estimated based on single baryon reconstructionmethod. The expected uncertainties for the measurements of the angulardistribution parameters are also discussed.

Analyzing $Ξ(1620)$ in the molecule picture in the Bethe-Salpeter  equation approach

  In this work, we assume that the observed state $\Xi(1620)$ is a $s$-wave$\Lambda\bar{K}$ or $\Sigma\bar{K}$ bound state. Based on this moleculepicture, we establish the Bethe-Salpeter equations for $\Xi(1620)$ in theladder and instantaneous approximations. We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equationsfor the $\Lambda\bar{K}$ and $\Sigma\bar{K}$ systems numerically and find thatthe $\Xi(1620)$ can be explained as $\Lambda\bar{K}$ and $\Sigma\bar{K}$ boundstates with $J^P=1/2^-$, respectively. Then we calculate the decay widths of$\Xi(1620)\rightarrow\Xi\pi$ in these two different molecule pictures systems,respectively.

Stability of the de Sitter spacetime in Horava-Lifshitz theory

  The stability of de Sitter spacetime in Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravitywith projectability but without detailed balance condition is studied. It isfound that, in contrast to the case of the Minkowski background, the spin-0graviton now is stable for any given $\xi$, and free of ghost for $\xi \le 0$in the infrared limit, where $\xi$ is the dynamical coupling constant.

Stability of vortex in a two-component superconductor

  Thermodynamic stability of composite vortex in a two-component superconductoris investigated by the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The predicted nature of thesevortices has recently attracted much attention. Here we consider axiallysymmetric quantized vortex and show that the stability of vortex depends onthree independent dimensionless parameters: $\kappa _{1}$, $\kappa _{2}$,$\kappa _{\xi}$, where $\kappa _{i}(i=1,2)$ is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter ofindividual component, $\kappa _{\xi }=\xi _{1}/\xi _{2}$ is the ratio of twocoherence lengths. We also show that there exists thermodynamic stable vortexin type-1+type-2 or type-2+type-2 materials over a range of these threeparameters.

Finite Size Scaling at the Topological Transition: Bilinear-Biquadratic  Spin-1 Chain

  We consider a finite size scaling across a topological phase transitionbetween dimerized and Haldane phases in bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain. Tothis end we perform high-accuracy variational matrix product state simulations.We show that the scaling function, expressed in terms of $L/\xi$, where $L$ isthe chain length and $\xi$ is the correlation length, coincides with that ofthree species of non-interacting massive Majorana fermions. This is inagreement with the fact that the critical theory of the model has centralcharge $c=3/2$. On the other hand, the correlation length $\xi$ exhibits anon-trivial dependence on parameters of the model.

Constraints on non-minimal coupling from quantum cosmology

  Quantum cosmology is investigated in a de Sitter minisuperspace model with aquantized scalar field non-minimally coupled to curvature. Quantum states ofthe scalar field must satisfy the regularity condition, which requires that theprobability of field fluctuations should not increase with their amplitude. Weshow that this condition imposes constraints on the allowed values of thecurvature coupling parameter $\xi$. This is a surprising result, since thefield dynamics depends only on the combination $m^2+\xi R$, where $m$ is thefield mass and $R = \mathrm{const}$ is the curvature, and does not depend on$\xi$ separately.

Helicity Amplitude Analysis of $J/ψ$ and  $ψ(2S)\rightarrowΞ(1530)\barΞ(1530)$

  We perform a helicity amplitude analysis for the processes of$e^+e^-$$\rightarrow$$J/\psi,\psi(2S)\rightarrow\Xi(1530)\bar\Xi(1530)\rightarrow\pi\pi\Xi\bar\Xi\rightarrow\Lambda\bar\Lambda4\pi\rightarrowp\bar{p}6\pi$. The joint angular distribution for these processes are obtained,which allows a proper estimation of the detection efficiency using helicityamplitude information. In addition, the sensitivities of measurement of hyperonasymmetry decay parameters for these processes are discussed.

Strong and radiative decays of DΞmolecular state and newly observed  $Ω_c$ states

  In this work, we study strong and radiative decays of S-wave D\Xi molecularstate, which is related to the \Omega^*_c states newly observed at LHCb. Thecoupling between the D\Xi molecular state and its constituents D and \Xi iscalculated by using the compositeness condition. With the obtained coupling,the partial decay widths of the D\Xi molecular state into the \Xi_c^{+}K^{-},\Xi^{'+}_cK^{-} and \Omega^{*}_c(2695)\gamma final states through hadronic loopare calculated with the help of the effective Lagrangians. By comparison withthe LHCb observation, the current results of total decay width support the\Omega^{*}_c(3119) or \Omega^{*}_c(3050) as D\Xi molecule while the the decaywidth of the \Omega^{*}_c(3000), \Omega^{*}_c(3066) and \Omega^{*}_c(3090) cannot be well reproduced in the molecular state picture. The partial decay widthsare also presented and helpful to further understand the internal structures of\Omega^{*}_c(3119) and \Omega^{*}_c(3050).

Algorithms to test open set condition for self-similar set related to  P.V. numbers

  Fix a P.V. number $\lambda ^{-1}>1.$ Given$\mathbf{p}=(p_{1},\cdots,p_{m})\in \mathbb{N}^{m}$,$\mathbf{b}=(b_{1},\cdots,b_{m})\in \mathbb{Q^{m}$, for the self-similar set$E_{\mathbf{p},\mathbf{b}}=\cup_{i=1}^{m}(\lambda^{p_{i}}E_{\mathbf{p},\mathbf{b}}+b_{i})$ we find an efficient algorithm totest whether $E_{\mathbf{p},\mathbf{b}}$ satisfies the open set condition(strong separation condition) or not.

  We study supersymmetry constraints on higher derivative deformations of typeIIB supergravity by consideration of superamplitudes. Combining constraints ofon-shell supervertices and basic results from string perturbation theory, wegive a simple argument for the non-renormalization theorem of Green and Sethi,and some of its generalizations.

Uniqueness of positive solutions with Concentration for the  Schrödinger-Newton problem

  We are concerned with the following Schr\"odinger-Newton problem  \begin{equation}  -\varepsilon^2\Delta u+V(x)u=\frac{1}{8\pi \varepsilon^2}  \big(\int_{\mathbb R^3}\frac{u^2(\xi)}{|x-\xi|}d\xi\big)u,~x\in \mathbb R^3.\end{equation} For $\varepsilon$ small enough, we show the uniqueness ofpositive solutions concentrating at the nondegenerate critical points of$V(x)$. The main tools are a local Pohozaev type of identity, blow-up analysisand the maximum principle. Our results also show that the asymptotic behaviorof concentrated points to Schr\"odinger-Newton problem is quite different fromthose of Schr\"odinger equations.

Analysis of the vertices $ρNN$, $ρΣΣ$ and $ρΞΞ$  with light-cone QCD sum rules

  In this article, we calculate the strong coupling constants of the $\rho NN$,$\rho\Sigma\Sigma$ and $\rho\Xi\Xi$ in the framework of the light-cone QCD sumrules approach. The strong coupling constants of the meson-baryon-baryon arethe fundamental parameters in the one-boson exchange model which describes thebaryon-baryon interactions successfully. The numerical values are in agreementwith the existing calculations in part. The electric and magnetic $F/(F+D)$ratios deviate from the prediction of the vector meson dominance theory, theSU(3) symmetry breaking effects are very large.

Analysis of the X(1835) and related baryonium states with Bethe-Salpeter  equation

  In this article, we study the mass spectrum of the baryon-antibaryon boundstates $p\bar{p}$, $\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$, $\Xi\bar{\Xi}$,$\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, $p\bar{N}(1440)$, $\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}(1660)$,$\Xi\bar{\Xi}^\prime$ and $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}(1600)$ with the Bethe-Salpeterequation. The numerical results indicate that the $p\bar{p}$,$\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$, $\Xi\bar{\Xi}$, $p\bar{N}(1440)$,$\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}(1660)$, $\Xi\bar{\Xi}^\prime$ bound states maybe exist, andthe new resonances X(1835) and X(2370) can be tentatively identified as the$p\bar{p}$ and $p\bar{N}(1440)$ (or $N(1400)\bar{p}$) bound states respectivelywith some gluon constituents, and the new resonance X(2120) may be apseudoscalar glueball. On the other hand, the Regge trajectory favorsidentifying the X(1835), X(2120) and X(2370) as the excited $\eta^\prime(958)$mesons with the radial quantum numbers $n=3$, 4 and 5, respectively.

Study of Phonon Modes in Germanium Nanowires

  The observation of pure phonon confinement effect in germanium nanowires islimited due to the illumination sensitivity of Raman spectra. In this paper wemeasured Raman spectra for different size germanium nanowires with differentexcitation laser powers and wavelengths. By eliminating the local heatingeffect, the phonon confinement effect for small size nanowires was clearlyidentified. We have also fitted the Raman feature changes to estimate the sizedistribution of nanowires for the first time.

Analysis of the Isgur-Wise function of the $Λ_b \to Λ_c$  transition with light-cone QCD sum rules

  In this article, we use the light-cone QCD sum rules to relate the$\Lambda_b$ baryon light-cone distribution amplitudes to the Isgur-Wisefunction $\xi(\omega)$ of the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c$ transition, and obtaina simple relation. The numerical value of the Isgur-Wise function $\xi(\omega)$is consistent with the prediction of the QCD sum rules.

Analysis of the $X(1835)$ as a baryonium state with Bethe-Salpeter  equation

  In this article, we take the X(1835) as a pseudoscalar baryonium state, andcalculate the mass spectrum of the baryon-antibaryon bound states $p\bar{p}$,$\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$, $\Xi\bar{\Xi}$, and $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ in theframework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a phenomenological potential. Thenumerical results indicate the $p\bar{p}$, $\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$ and$\Xi\bar{\Xi}$ bound states maybe exist, and the $X(1835)$ can be tentativelyidentified as the $p\bar{p}$ bound state.

Fiber-based ultra-stable frequency synchronization using client-side,  1f-2f active compensation method

  We demonstrate a frequency synchronization scheme with the phase noisecompensation function placed at the client site. One transmitting module hencecan be linked with multiple client sites. As a performance test, using twoseparate 50 km fiber spools, we recover the 100 MHz disseminated referencefrequencies at two remote sites, separately. Relative frequency stabilitiesbetween two recovered frequency signals of 2.8E-14/s and 2.5E-17/day areobtained. This scalable scheme is suitable for the applications of frequencydissemination with a star-topology, such as SKA and DSN.

Recognize Foreign Low-Frequency Words with Similar Pairs

  Low-frequency words place a major challenge for automatic speech recognition(ASR). The probabilities of these words, which are often important nameentities, are generally under-estimated by the language model (LM) due to theirlimited occurrences in the training data. Recently, we proposed a word-pairapproach to deal with the problem, which borrows information of frequent wordsto enhance the probabilities of low-frequency words. This paper presents anextension to the word-pair method by involving multiple `predicting words' toproduce better estimation for low-frequency words. We also employ this approachto deal with out-of-language words in the task of multi-lingual speechrecognition.

Finite Size Scaling of Topological Entanglement Entropy

  We consider scaling of the entanglement entropy across a topological quantumphase transition in one dimension. The change of the topology manifests itselfin a sub-leading term, which scales as $L^{-1/\alpha}$ with the size of thesubsystem $L$, here $\alpha$ is the R\'{e}nyi index. This term reveals theuniversal scaling function $h_\alpha(L/\xi)$, where $\xi$ is the correlationlength, which is sensitive to the topological index.

Canonical connection on contact manifolds

  We introduce a canonical affine connection on the contact manifold $(Q,\xi)$,which is associated to each contact triad $(Q,\lambda,J)$ where $\lambda$ is acontact form and $J:\xi \to \xi$ is an endomorphism with $J^2 = -id$ compatibleto $d\lambda$. We call it the \emph{contact triad connection} of$(Q,\lambda,J)$ and prove its existence and uniqueness. The connection iscanonical in that the pull-back connection $\phi^*\nabla$ of a triad connection$\nabla$ becomes the triad connection of the pull-back triad $(Q,\phi^*\lambda, \phi^*J)$ for any diffeomorphism $\phi:Q \to Q$ satisfying$\phi^*\lambda = \lambda$ (sometimes called a strict contact diffeomorphism).It also preserves both the triad metric $$ g_{(\lambda,J)} = d\lambda(\cdot,J\cdot) + \lambda \otimes \lambda $$ and $J$ regarded as an endomorphism on $TQ= \mathbb R\{X_\lambda\}\oplus \xi$, and is characterized by its torsionproperties and the requirement that the contact form $\lambda$ be holomorphicin the $CR$-sense. In particular, the connection restricts to a Hermitianconnection $\nabla^\pi$ on the Hermitian vector bundle $(\xi,J,g_\xi)$ with$g_\xi = d\lambda(\cdot, J\cdot)|_{\xi}$, which we call the \emph{contactHermitian connection} of $(\xi,J,g_\xi)$. These connections greatly simplifytensorial calculations in the sequels \cite{oh-wang1}, \cite{oh-wang2}performed in the authors' analytic study of the map $w$, called contactinstantons, which satisfy the nonlinear elliptic system of equations$\overline{\partial}^\pi w = 0, \, d(w^*\lambda \circ j) = 0$ in the contacttriad $(Q,\lambda,J)$.

Total positivity of Riordan arrays

  We present sufficient conditions for total positivity of Riordan arrays. Asapplications we show that many well-known combinatorial triangles are totallypositive and many famous combinatorial numbers are log-convex in a unifiedapproach.

The minimum Q-index of strongly connected bipartite digraphs with  complete bipartite subdigraphs

  Let $\mathcal{G}_{n,p,q}$ denote the set of strongly connected bipartitedigraphs on $n$ vertices which contain a complete bipartite subdigraph$\overleftrightarrow{K_{p,q}}$, where $p, q, n$ are positive integers and $p+q\leq n$. In this paper, we study the Q-index (i.e. the signless Laplacianspectral radius) of $\mathcal{G}_{n,p,q}$, and determine the extremal digraphthat has the minimum Q-index.

The unicyclic graphs with the second smallest normalized Laplacian  eigenvalue no less than $1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$

  Let $\lambda_{2}(G)$ be the second smallest normalized Laplacian eigenvalueof a graph $G$. In this paper, we determine all unicyclic graphs of order$n\geq21$ with $\lambda_{2}(G)\geq 1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$. Moreover, theunicyclic graphs with $\lambda_{2}(G)=1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$ are alsodetermined.

Large and moderate deviations for a $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued branching  random walk with a random environment in time

  We consider a $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued branching random walk with a stationaryand ergodic environment $\xi=(\xi_n)$ indexed by time $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Let$Z_n$ be the counting measure of particles of generation $n$. With help of theuniform convergence of martingale and the multifractal analysis, we establish alarge deviation result for the measures $Z_n$ as well as a moderate deviationprinciple.

LeaveNow: A Social Network-based Smart Evacuation System for Disaster  Management

  The importance of timely response to natural disasters and evacuatingaffected people to safe areas is paramount to save lives. Emergency servicesare often handicapped by the amount of rescue resources at their disposal. Wepresent a system that leverages the power of a social network forming newconnections among people based on \textit{real-time location} and expands therescue resources pool by adding private sector cars. We also introduce acar-sharing algorithm to identify safe routes in an emergency with the aim ofminimizing evacuation time, maximizing pick-up of people without cars, andavoiding traffic congestion.

Adiabatic Regularization and Green's Function Regularization of Scalar  Field in de Sitter Space: Positive Spectral Energy Density and No Trace  Anomaly

  To remove the vacuum UV divergence of a quantum field in curved spacetime,the conventional adiabatic regularization proposes to subtract the $k$-mode ofstress tensor by its 4th-order subtraction term. For a massive scalar field inthe vacuum in de Sitter space, we find that the 4th-order regularized spectralenergy density is negative, and the 2nd-order regularization for minimalcoupling $\xi=0$ and the 0th-order for conformal coupling $\xi=\frac16$ yieldpositive and UV convergent spectral energy density and power spectrum. For amassless scalar field with $\xi=0$ or $\frac16$, the regularized power spectrumand spectral stress tensor are zero, and particularly for $\xi=\frac16$, thereis no trace anomaly which was caused by the incorrect prescription of 4th-orderregularization. For $\xi\in(0,\frac16)$, we find that there exists noregularization of a fixed order, which could achieve positive and convergentspectral energy density and power spectrum, so regularization remainsunsettled. For Green's function in position space, we show that theregularization is generally plagued by a log IR divergence. For $m=0$ with$\xi=0$ or $\frac16$ in de Sitter space, we regularize the Green's functions,yielding vanishing results, agreeing with the zero power spectra given byadiabatic regularization. For massive cases with $\xi=0$ or $\frac16$ in deSitter space, we perform Fourier transformation of the regularized powerspectra and obtainregularized Green's functions which are IR and UV convergent,thus overcome the log IR divergence difficulty. We also show that the traceanomaly in de Sitter space was an artifact caused by incorrect treatment of themassless limit of the incomplete subtraction terms. In a general curvedspacetime, appropriate subtraction terms for the Green's function are unknown,so it is invalid to claim the trace anomaly before the IR divergence difficultyis resolved.

Global solvability and stability to a nutrient-taxis model with porous  medium slow diffusion

  In this paper, we study a nutrient-taxis model with porous medium slowdiffusion \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &u_t=\Deltau^m-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+\xi uv-\rho u, \\ &v_t-\Delta v=-vu+\mu v(1-v),\end{aligned}\right. \end{align*} in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbbR^3$ with zero-flux boundary condition. It is shown that for any$m>\frac{11}4-\sqrt 3$,the problem admits a global weak solution for any largeinitial datum. We divide the study into three cases,(i) $\xi\mu=0, \rho\ge 0$;(ii) $\xi\mu\rho>0$; (iii) $\xi\mu>0$, $\rho=0$. In particular, for Case (i)and Case (ii), the global solutions are uniformly bounded. Subsequently, thelarge time behavior of these global bounded solutions are also discussed. Atlast, we also extend the results to the coupled chemotaxis-Stokes system.Important progresses for chemotaxis-Stokes system with $m>\frac 76$, $m>\frac87$ and $m>\frac 98$ have been carried out respectively by \cite{W2, TW2, W3},but leave a gap for $1<m\le \frac98$. Our result for chemotaxis-Stokes systemsupplements part of the gap $(\frac{11}4-\sqrt 3, \frac 98)$. Here$\frac{11}4-\sqrt 3\approx 1.018$.

$Ξ$(2030) and $Ξ$(2120) as $\bar{K}^*Σ$ molecular states

  In this work, the molecular states from the \bar{K}^{*}\Sigma interaction arestudied in a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach with theone-boson-exchange potentials. We consider the exchanges of vector (\rho,\omegaand \phi) mesons and pseudoscalar (\pi and \eta) mesons to describe the\bar{K}^{*}\Sigma interaction with the coupling constants determined by theSU(3) symmetry, The poles of the scattering amplitude are searched for to findthe molecular states dynamically generated from the \bar{K}^{*}\Sigmainteraction. A bound state with quantum number I(J^{p})=1/2(5/2^{+}) isproduced, which can be associated to the \Xi(2030) baryon. Other bound stateswith J\le{}5/2 are also searched for and it is found that there exist boundstates with quantum numbers I(J^P)=1/2(1/2^-), 1/2(3/2^{-}), and 1/2(3/2^+).The \Xi(2120) may be a candidate for one of these three bound states. Inaddition, we also find two bound states with isospin 3/2 and spin parities1/2^- and 1/2^+.

Asymptotics of Solutions of a Perfect Fluid Coupled with a Cosmological  Constant in Four-Dimensional Spacetime with Toroidal Symmetry

  Asymptotics of solutions of a perfect fluid when coupled with a cosmologicalconstant in four-dimensional spacetime with toroidal symmetry are studied. Inparticular, it is found that the problem of self-similar solutions of the firstkind for a fluid with the equation of state, $p = k \rho$, can be reduced tosolving a master equation of the form, $$ 2 F(q, k)\frac{q''(\xi)}{q'(\xi)} -G(q,k) q'(\xi) = \frac{4}{\xi}. $$ For $k = 0$ and $k = -1/3$ the generalsolutions are obtained and their main local and global properties are studiedin detail.

Experimental observation of Dirac-like surface states and topological  phase transition in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te(111) films

  The surface of a topological crystalline insulator (TCI) carries an evennumber of Dirac cones protected by crystalline symmetry. We epitaxially grewhigh quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te(111) films and investigated the TCI phase byin-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te(111)films undergo a topological phase transition from trivial insulator to TCI viaincreasing the Sn/Pb ratio, accompanied by a crossover from n-type to p-typedoping. In addition, a hybridization gap is opened in the surface states whenthe thickness of film is reduced to the two-dimensional limit. The workdemonstrates an approach to manipulating the topological properties of TCI,which is of importance for future fundamental research and applications basedon TCI.

Antiferromagnetic Potts Models on the Square Lattice

  We study the antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square latticefor $q=3$ and $q=4$, using the Wang-Swendsen-Koteck\'y Monte Carlo algorithmand a new finite-size-scaling extrapolation method. For $q=3$ we obtain goodcontrol up to correlation length $\xi \sim 5000$; the data are consistent with$\xi(\beta) = A e^{2\beta} \beta (1 + a_1 e^{-\beta} + \ldots)$ as$\beta\to\infty$. For $q=4$ the model is disordered even at zero temperature.

Scalar wave propagation in topological black hole backgrounds

  We consider the evolution of a scalar field coupled to curvature intopological black hole spacetimes. We solve numerically the scalar waveequation with different curvature-coupling constant $\xi$ and show that a richspectrum of wave propagation is revealed when $\xi$ is introduced. Relationsbetween quasinormal modes and the size of different topological black holeshave also been investigated.

Classification of the Super-conducting order parameters under the point  group symmetry for a multi-band system: application to LaOFeAs

  All the possible super-conducting order parameters for the LaOFeAs system areclassified by their transformation under the complete crystal symmetry. Thegeneral forms of the super-conducting gap functions for each class arediscussed. We find that the gap functions in such a multi-band system belong tothree types, full gap, nodal type and finite {}``Fermi arc'' type. Possiblephysical consequences caused by different types of gap functions are alsodiscussed.

Hyperconjugative Effect on the Electronic Wavefunctions of Ethanol

  Hyperconjugation is a basic conception of chemistry. Its straightforwardeffect is exhibited by the spatial delocalization characteristics of theelectron density distributions or wavefunctions. Such effects on the electronwavefunctions of the highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of two ethanolconformers are demonstrated with electron momentum spectroscopy together withnatural bond orbital analyses, exhibiting the distinctly different symmetriesof the HOMO wavefunctions in momentum space.

Pairwise Quantum Correlations for Superpositions of Dicke States

  Pairwise correlation is really an important property for multi-qubit states.For the two-qubit X states extracted from Dicke states and their superpositionstates, we obtain a compact expression of the quantum discord by numericalcheck. We then apply the expression to discuss the quantum correlation of thereduced two-qubit states of Dicke states and their superpositions, and theresults are compared with those obtained by entanglement of formation, which isa quantum entanglement measure.

Resolvent and spectral measure on non-trapping asymptotically hyperbolic  manifolds I: Resolvent construction at high energy

  This is the first in a series of papers in which we investigate the resolventand spectral measure on non-trapping asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds withapplications to the restriction theorem, spectral multiplier results andStrichartz estimates. In this first paper, we use semiclassical Lagrangiandistributions and semiclassical intersecting Lagrangian distributions, alongwith Mazzeo-Melrose 0-calculus, to construct the high energy resolvent ongeneral non- trapping asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, generalizing thework due to Melrose, Sa Barreto and Vasy. We note that there is an independentwork by Y. Wang which also constructs the high-energy resolvent.

Convergence of martingale and moderate deviations for a branching random  walk with a random environment in time

  We consider a branching random walk on $\mathbb{R}$ with a stationary andergodic environment $\xi=(\xi_n)$ indexed by time $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Let $Z_n$be the counting measure of particles of generation $n$ and $\tilde Z_n(t)=\inte^{tx}Z_n(dx)$ be its Laplace transform. We show the $L^p$ convergence rate andthe uniform convergence of the martingale $\tilde Z_n(t)/\mathbb E[\tildeZ_n(t)|\xi]$, and establish a moderate deviation principle for the measures$Z_n$.

The Reversible Spin Switch by External Control of Interval Distance of  CuPc and C59N with the investigation of DFT

  In this paper, we introduce a new kind of spin switch based on a joint systemof copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and C59N. Using density functional theory, weinvestigate the total magnetic moment of this system when gradually changingthe interval distance between two molecules. The spin hopping happens duringthe critical distance with very low energy. This phenomenon shows a possiblereality of reversible spin switch by external control of the interval distance.With orbital analysis and electron transfer consideration, the form of C59N+-CuPc- ion pair support this spin hopping phenomenon.

Magnetic properties of quasi one-dimensional vanadium-benzene nanowire  affected by gas molecules: a first-principle study

  Magnetic properties of quasi one-dimensional vanadium-benzene nanowires(VBNW) are investigated theoretically with the absorption of gas molecules-NOand NO2. With the increase adsorption of NO on VBNW, the phase transition fromhalf metal to ferromagnetic metal and last to paramagnetic semiconductor can beobserved. With the increase of NO2 on VBNW, half metallic property can beenhanced at first and decreased later. Thus, the electronic and magneticproperties of VBNW can be sensitive and selective to NO and NO2, revealing thepotential applications in spintronic sensors of these two kinds of molecules.

On Khintchine exponents and Lyapunov exponents of continued fractions

  Assume that $x\in [0,1) $ admits its continued fraction expansion $x=[a_1(x),a_2(x),...]$. The Khintchine exponent $\gamma(x)$ of $x$ is defined by$\gamma(x):=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n \log a_j(x)$ whenthe limit exists. Khintchine spectrum $\dim E_\xi$ is fully studied, where $E_{\xi}:=\{x\in [0,1):\gamma(x)=\xi\} (\xi \geq 0)$ and $\dim$ denotes theHausdorff dimension. In particular, we prove the remarkable fact that theKhintchine spectrum $\dim E_{\xi}$, as function of $\xi \in [0, +\infty)$, isneither concave nor convex. This is a new phenomenon from the usual point ofview of multifractal analysis. Fast Khintchine exponents defined by$\gamma^{\phi}(x):=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{\phi(n)} \sum_{j=1}^n \loga_j(x)$ are also studied, where $\phi (n)$ tends to the infinity faster than$n$ does. Under some regular conditions on $\phi$, it is proved that the fastKhintchine spectrum $\dim (\{x\in [0,1]: \gamma^{\phi}(x)= \xi \}) $ is aconstant function. Our method also works for other spectra like the Lyapunovspectrum and the fast Lyapunov spectrum.

Dissemination stability and phase noise specification of fiber-cascaded  RF frequency dissemination

  Over the past decade, fiber based frequency dissemination has achievedsignificant progresses in following aspects. To study the disseminationstability and phase noise specifications of the fiber-cascaded RF frequencydissemination system, we perform a lab-top experiment using three sets of RFmodulated frequency dissemination systems. They are linked by 50 km + 50 km +45km fiber spools. The dissemination stabilities of each segments and wholesystem are measured simultaneously. After that, the phase noise of each segmentis also measured and the result shows that the phase noise spectrums ofrecovered frequency signal can be optimized via narrow band phase lock loop.

Non-canonical two-field inflation to order $ξ^2$

  In non-canonical two-field inflation models, deviations from the canonicalmodel can be captured by a parameter $\xi$. We show this parameter is usuallyone half of the slow-roll order and analytically calculate the primordial powerspectra accurate to order $\xi^2$. The super-horizon perturbations are studiedwith an improved method, which gives a correction of order $\xi^2$. Threetypical examples demonstrate that our analytical formulae of power spectra fitwell with numerical simulation.

Hopping Conduction in Disordered Carbon Nanotubes

  We report electrical transport measurements on individual disordered carbonnanotubes, grown catalytically in a nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide template.In both as-grown and annealed types of nanotubes, the low-field conductanceshows as exp[-(T_{0}/T)^{1/2}] dependence on temperature T, suggesting thathopping conduction is the dominant transport mechanism, albeit with differentdisorder-related coefficients T_{0}. The field dependence of low-temperatureconductance behaves an exp[-(xi_{0}/xi)^{1/2}] with high electric field xi atsufficiently low T. Finally, both annealed and unannealed nanotubes exhibitweak positive magnetoresistance at low T = 1.7 K. Comparison with theoryindicates that our data are best explained by Coulomb-gap variable rangehopping conduction and permits the extraction of disorder-dependentlocalization length and dielectric constant.
