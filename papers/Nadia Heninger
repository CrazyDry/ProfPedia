Approximate common divisors via lattices

  We analyze the multivariate generalization of Howgrave-Graham's algorithm forthe approximate common divisor problem. In the m-variable case with modulus Nand approximate common divisor of size N^beta, this improves the size of theerror tolerated from N^(beta^2) to N^(beta^((m+1)/m)), under a commonly usedheuristic assumption. This gives a more detailed analysis of the hardnessassumption underlying the recent fully homomorphic cryptosystem of van Dijk,Gentry, Halevi, and Vaikuntanathan. While these results do not challenge thesuggested parameters, a 2^(n^epsilon) approximation algorithm with epsilon<2/3for lattice basis reduction in n dimensions could be used to break theseparameters. We have implemented our algorithm, and it performs better inpractice than the theoretical analysis suggests.  Our results fit into a broader context of analogies between cryptanalysis andcoding theory. The multivariate approximate common divisor problem is thenumber-theoretic analogue of multivariate polynomial reconstruction, and wedevelop a corresponding lattice-based algorithm for the latter problem. Inparticular, it specializes to a lattice-based list decoding algorithm forParvaresh-Vardy and Guruswami-Rudra codes, which are multivariate extensions ofReed-Solomon codes. This yields a new proof of the list decoding radii forthese codes.

Ideal forms of Coppersmith's theorem and Guruswami-Sudan list decoding

  We develop a framework for solving polynomial equations with size constraintson solutions. We obtain our results by showing how to apply a technique ofCoppersmith for finding small solutions of polynomial equations modulo integersto analogous problems over polynomial rings, number fields, and functionfields. This gives us a unified view of several problems arising naturally incryptography, coding theory, and the study of lattices. We give (1) apolynomial-time algorithm for finding small solutions of polynomial equationsmodulo ideals over algebraic number fields, (2) a faster variant of theGuruswami-Sudan algorithm for list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, and (3) analgorithm for list decoding of algebraic-geometric codes that handles bothsingle-point and multi-point codes. Coppersmith's algorithm uses lattice basisreduction to find a short vector in a carefully constructed lattice; powerfulanalogies from algebraic number theory allow us to identify the appropriateanalogue of a lattice in each application and provide efficient algorithms tofind a suitably short vector, thus allowing us to give completely parallelproofs of the above theorems.

Cryptographic applications of capacity theory: On the optimality of  Coppersmith's method for univariate polynomials

  We draw a new connection between Coppersmith's method for finding smallsolutions to polynomial congruences modulo integers and the capacity theory ofadelic subsets of algebraic curves. Coppersmith's method uses lattice basisreduction to construct an auxiliary polynomial that vanishes at the desiredsolutions. Capacity theory provides a toolkit for proving when polynomials withcertain boundedness properties do or do not exist. Using capacity theory, weprove that Coppersmith's bound for univariate polynomials is optimal in thesense that there are \emph{no} auxiliary polynomials of the type he used thatwould allow finding roots of size $N^{1/d+\epsilon}$ for monic degree-$d$polynomials modulo $N$. Our results rule out the existence of polynomials ofany degree and do not rely on lattice algorithms, thus eliminating thepossibility of even superpolynomial-time improvements to Coppersmith's bound.We extend this result to constructions of auxiliary polynomials using binomialpolynomials, and rule out the existence of any auxiliary polynomial of thisform that would find solutions of size $N^{1/d+\epsilon}$ unless $N$ has a verysmall prime factor.

Properties of Constacyclic Codes Under the Schur Product

  For a subspace $W$ of a vector space $V$ of dimension $n$, the Schur-productspace $W^{\langle k\rangle}$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is defined to be the spanof all vectors formed by the component-wise multiplication of $k$ vectors in$W$. It is well known that repeated applications of the Schur product to thesubspace $W$ creates subspaces $W, W^{\langle 2 \rangle}, W^{\langle 3\rangle}, \ldots$ whose dimensions are monotonically non-decreasing. However,quantifying the structure and growth of such spaces remains an important openproblem with applications to cryptography and coding theory. This papercharacterizes how increasing powers of constacyclic codes grow under the Schurproduct and gives necessary and sufficient criteria for when powers of the codeand or dimension of the code are invariant under the Schur product.

A kilobit hidden SNFS discrete logarithm computation

  We perform a special number field sieve discrete logarithm computation in a1024-bit prime field. To our knowledge, this is the first kilobit-sizeddiscrete logarithm computation ever reported for prime fields. This computationtook a little over two months of calendar time on an academic cluster using theopen-source CADO-NFS software. Our chosen prime $p$ looks random, and $p--1$has a 160-bit prime factor, in line with recommended parameters for the DigitalSignature Algorithm. However, our p has been trapdoored in such a way that thespecial number field sieve can be used to compute discrete logarithms in$\mathbb{F}\_p^*$ , yet detecting that p has this trapdoor seems out of reach.Twenty-five years ago, there was considerable controversy around thepossibility of back-doored parameters for DSA. Our computations show thattrapdoored primes are entirely feasible with current computing technology. Wealso describe special number field sieve discrete log computations carried outfor multiple weak primes found in use in the wild. As can be expected from atrapdoor mechanism which we say is hard to detect, our research did not revealany trapdoored prime in wide use. The only way for a user to defend against ahypothetical trapdoor of this kind is to require verifiably random primes.

On the Integrality of n-th Roots of Generating Functions

  Motivated by the discovery that the eighth root of the theta series of theE_8 lattice and the 24th root of the theta series of the Leech lattice bothhave integer coefficients, we investigate the question of when an arbitraryelement f in R (where R = 1 + xZ[[x]]) can be written as f = g^n for g in R, n>= 2. Let P_n := {g^n : g in R} and let mu_n := n Product_{p|n} p. We showamong other things that (i) for f in R, f in P_n <=> f mod mu_n in P_n, and(ii) if f in P_n, there is a unique g in P_n with coefficients mod mu_n/n suchthat f == g^n (mod mu_n). In particular, if f == 1 (mod mu_n) then f in P_n.The latter assertion implies that the theta series of any extremal evenunimodular lattice in R^n (e.g. E_8 in R^8) is in P_n if n is of the form 2^i3^j 5^k (i >= 3). There do not seem to be any exact analogues for codes,although we show that the weight enumerator of the r-th order Reed-Muller codeof length 2^m is in P_{2^r}. We give a number of other results and conjectures,and establish a conjecture of Paul D. Hanna that there is a unique element f inP_n (n != 2) with coefficients restricted to the set {1, 2, ..., n}.
