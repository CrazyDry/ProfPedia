Improving Interaction with Virtual Globes through Spatial Thinking:
  Helping Users Ask "Why?"

  Virtual globes have progressed from little-known technology to broadly
popular software in a mere few years. We investigated this phenomenon through a
survey and discovered that, while virtual globes are en vogue, their use is
restricted to a small set of tasks so simple that they do not involve any
spatial thinking. Spatial thinking requires that users ask "what is where" and
"why"; the most common virtual globe tasks only include the "what". Based on
the results of this survey, we have developed a multi-touch virtual globe
derived from an adapted virtual globe paradigm designed to widen the potential
uses of the technology by helping its users to inquire about both the "what is
where" and "why" of spatial distribution. We do not seek to provide users with
full GIS (geographic information system) functionality, but rather we aim to
facilitate the asking and answering of simple "why" questions about general
topics that appeal to a wide virtual globe user base.


Helping Computers Understand Geographically-Bound Activity Restrictions

  The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development of
location-aware technologies in a number of important domains. One such type of
"unmapped" geographic data is space usage rules (SURs), which are defined as
geographically-bound activity restrictions (e.g. "no dogs", "no smoking", "no
fishing", "no skateboarding"). Researchers in the area of human-computer
interaction have recently begun to develop techniques for the automated mapping
of SURs with the aim of supporting activity planning systems (e.g. one-touch
"Can I Smoke Here?" apps, SUR-aware vacation planning tools). In this paper, we
present a novel SUR mapping technique - SPtP - that outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by 30% for one of the most important components of
the SUR mapping pipeline: associating a point observation of a SUR (e.g. a 'no
smoking' sign) with the corresponding polygon in which the SUR applies (e.g.
the nearby park or the entire campus on which the sign is located). This paper
also contributes a series of new SUR benchmark datasets to help further
research in this area.


SubwayPS: Towards Enabling Smartphone Positioning in Underground Public
  Transportation Systems

  Thanks to rapid advances in technologies like GPS and Wi-Fi positioning,
smartphone users are able to determine their location almost everywhere they
go. This is not true, however, of people who are traveling in underground
public transportation networks, one of the few types of high-traffic areas
where smartphones do not have access to accurate position information. In this
paper, we introduce the problem of underground transport positioning on
smartphones and present SubwayPS, an accelerometer-based positioning technique
that allows smartphones to determine their location substantially better than
baseline approaches, even deep beneath city streets. We highlight several
immediate applications of positioning in subway networks in domains ranging
from mobile advertising to mobile maps and present MetroNavigator, a
proof-of-concept smartphone and smartwatch app that notifies users of upcoming
points-of-interest and alerts them when it is time to get ready to exit the
train.


Pharos: improving navigation instructions on smartwatches by including
  global landmarks

  Landmark-based navigation systems have proven benefits relative to
traditional turn-by-turn systems that use street names and distances. However,
one obstacle to the implementation of landmark-based navigation systems is the
complex challenge of selecting salient local landmarks at each decision point
for each user. In this paper, we present Pharos, a novel system that extends
turn-by-turn navigation instructions using a single global landmark (e.g. the
Eiffel Tower, the Burj Khalifa, municipal TV towers) rather than multiple,
hard-to-select local landmarks. We first show that our approach is feasible in
a large number of cities around the world through the use of computer vision to
select global landmarks. We then present the results of a study demonstrating
that by including global landmarks in navigation instructions, users navigate
more confidently and build a more accurate mental map of the navigated area
than using turn-by-turn instructions.
