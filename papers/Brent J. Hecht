Improving Interaction with Virtual Globes through Spatial Thinking:  Helping Users Ask "Why?"

  Virtual globes have progressed from little-known technology to broadlypopular software in a mere few years. We investigated this phenomenon through asurvey and discovered that, while virtual globes are en vogue, their use isrestricted to a small set of tasks so simple that they do not involve anyspatial thinking. Spatial thinking requires that users ask "what is where" and"why"; the most common virtual globe tasks only include the "what". Based onthe results of this survey, we have developed a multi-touch virtual globederived from an adapted virtual globe paradigm designed to widen the potentialuses of the technology by helping its users to inquire about both the "what iswhere" and "why" of spatial distribution. We do not seek to provide users withfull GIS (geographic information system) functionality, but rather we aim tofacilitate the asking and answering of simple "why" questions about generaltopics that appeal to a wide virtual globe user base.

Helping Computers Understand Geographically-Bound Activity Restrictions

  The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development oflocation-aware technologies in a number of important domains. One such type of"unmapped" geographic data is space usage rules (SURs), which are defined asgeographically-bound activity restrictions (e.g. "no dogs", "no smoking", "nofishing", "no skateboarding"). Researchers in the area of human-computerinteraction have recently begun to develop techniques for the automated mappingof SURs with the aim of supporting activity planning systems (e.g. one-touch"Can I Smoke Here?" apps, SUR-aware vacation planning tools). In this paper, wepresent a novel SUR mapping technique - SPtP - that outperformsstate-of-the-art approaches by 30% for one of the most important components ofthe SUR mapping pipeline: associating a point observation of a SUR (e.g. a 'nosmoking' sign) with the corresponding polygon in which the SUR applies (e.g.the nearby park or the entire campus on which the sign is located). This paperalso contributes a series of new SUR benchmark datasets to help furtherresearch in this area.

SubwayPS: Towards Enabling Smartphone Positioning in Underground Public  Transportation Systems

  Thanks to rapid advances in technologies like GPS and Wi-Fi positioning,smartphone users are able to determine their location almost everywhere theygo. This is not true, however, of people who are traveling in undergroundpublic transportation networks, one of the few types of high-traffic areaswhere smartphones do not have access to accurate position information. In thispaper, we introduce the problem of underground transport positioning onsmartphones and present SubwayPS, an accelerometer-based positioning techniquethat allows smartphones to determine their location substantially better thanbaseline approaches, even deep beneath city streets. We highlight severalimmediate applications of positioning in subway networks in domains rangingfrom mobile advertising to mobile maps and present MetroNavigator, aproof-of-concept smartphone and smartwatch app that notifies users of upcomingpoints-of-interest and alerts them when it is time to get ready to exit thetrain.

Pharos: improving navigation instructions on smartwatches by including  global landmarks

  Landmark-based navigation systems have proven benefits relative totraditional turn-by-turn systems that use street names and distances. However,one obstacle to the implementation of landmark-based navigation systems is thecomplex challenge of selecting salient local landmarks at each decision pointfor each user. In this paper, we present Pharos, a novel system that extendsturn-by-turn navigation instructions using a single global landmark (e.g. theEiffel Tower, the Burj Khalifa, municipal TV towers) rather than multiple,hard-to-select local landmarks. We first show that our approach is feasible ina large number of cities around the world through the use of computer vision toselect global landmarks. We then present the results of a study demonstratingthat by including global landmarks in navigation instructions, users navigatemore confidently and build a more accurate mental map of the navigated areathan using turn-by-turn instructions.
