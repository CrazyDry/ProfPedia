Continuous-wave Raman Lasing in Aluminum Nitride Microresonators

  We report the first investigation on continuous-wave Raman lasing inhigh-quality-factor aluminum nitride (AlN) microring resonators. Althoughwurtzite AlN is known to exhibit six Raman-active phonons, single-mode Ramanlasing with low threshold and high slope efficiency is demonstrated. Selectiveexcitation of A$_1^\mathrm{TO}$ and E$_2^\mathrm{high}$ phonons with Ramanshifts of $\sim$612 and 660 cm$^{-1}$ is observed by adjusting the polarizationof the pump light. A theoretical analysis of Raman scattering efficiency within${c}$-plane (0001) of AlN is carried out to help account for the observedlasing behavior. Bidirectional lasing is experimentally confirmed as a resultof symmetric Raman gain in micro-scale waveguides. Furthermore, second-orderRaman lasing with unparalleled output power of $\sim$11.3 mW is obtained, whichoffers the capability to yield higher order Raman lasers for mid-infraredapplications.

Epitaxial Growth and Band Structure of Te Film on Graphene

  Tellurium (Te) films with monolayer and few-layer thickness are obtained bymolecular beam epitaxy on a graphene/6H-SiC(0001) substrate and investigated byin situ scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We revealthat the Te films are composed of parallel-arranged helical Te chainsflat-lying on the graphene surface, exposing the (1x1) facet of (10-10) of thebulk crystal. The band gap of Te films increases monotonically with decreasingthickness, reaching ~0.92 eV for the monolayer Te. An explicit band bending atthe edge between the monolayer Te and graphene substrate is visualized. Withthe thickness controlled in atomic scale, Te films show potential applicationsof in electronics and optoelectronics.
