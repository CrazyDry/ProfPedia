An HFB scheme in natural orbitals

  We present a formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations whichsolves the problem directly in the basis of natural orbitals. This provides avery efficient scheme which is particularly suited for large scale calculationson coordinate-space grids.

Microscopic models for exotic nuclei

  Starting from successful self-consistent mean-field models, this paperdiscusses why and how to go beyond the mean field approximation. To includelong-range correlations from fluctuations in collective degrees of freedom, onehas to consider symmetry restoration and configuration mixing, which giveaccess to ground-state correlations and spectroscopy.

Structure of superheavy nuclei

  Properties of transactinide nuclei needed for the interpretation ofspectroscopic data and for the extrapolation to the expected "island ofstability" of superheavy nuclei are reviewed from a theorist's point of view inthe framework of self-consistent mean-field models.

The Berenstein-Kirillov group and cactus groups

  Berenstein and Kirillov have studied the action of Bender-Knuth moves onsemistandard tableaux. Losev has studied a cactus group action inKazhdan-Lusztig theory; in type $A$ this action can also be identified in thework of Henriques and Kamnitzer. We establish the relationship between the twoactions. We show that the Berenstein-Kirillov group is a quotient of the cactusgroup. We use this to derive previously unknown relations in theBerenstein-Kirillov group. We also determine precise implications betweensubsets of relations in the two groups, which yields a presentation for cactusgroups in terms of Bender-Knuth generators.

The Z=82 shell closure in neutron-deficient Pb isotopes

  Recent mass measurements show a substantial weakening of the binding energydifference delta_{2p} (Z,N) = E(Z-2,N) - 2 E(Z,N) + E(Z+2,N) in theneutron-deficient Pb isotopes. As delta_{2p} is often attributed to the size ofthe proton magic gap, it might be speculated that the reduction in delta_{2p}is related to a weakening of the spherical Z=82 shell. We demonstrate that theobserved trend is described quantitatively by self-consistent mean-field modelsin terms of deformed ground states of Hg and Po isotopes.

Comment on ``Structure of exotic nuclei and superheavy elements in a  relativistic shell model''

  A recent paper [M. Rashdan, Phys. Rev. C 63, 044303 (2001)] introduces thenew parameterization NL-RA1 of the relativistic mean-field model which isclaimed to give a better description of nuclear properties than earlier ones.Using this model ^{298}114 is predicted to be a doubly-magic nucleus. As willbe shown in this comment these findings are to be doubted as they are obtainedwith an unrealistic parameterization of the pairing interaction and neglectingground-state deformation.

Mean-field models and superheavy elements

  We discuss the performance of two widely used nuclear mean-field models, therelativistic mean-field theory (RMF) and the non-relativisticSkyrme-Hartree-Fock approach (SHF), with particular emphasis on the descriptionof superheavy elements (SHE). We provide a short introduction to the SHF andRMF, the relations between these two approaches and the relations to othernuclear structure models, briefly review the basic properties with respect tonormal nuclear observables, and finally present and discuss recent results onthe binding properties of SHE computed with a broad selection of SHF and RMFparametrisations.

Configuration mixing of angular-momentum and particle-number projected  triaxial HFB states using the Skyrme energy density functional

  We present a method based on mean-field states generated by triaxialquadrupole constraints which are projected on particle number and angularmomentum and mixed by the generator coordinate method on the quadrupole moment.This method is equivalent to a seven-dimensional GCM calculation, mixing allfive degrees of freedom of the quadrupole operator and the gauge angles forprotons and neutrons. A first application to Mg24 permits to analyze in detailthe effects of triaxial deformations and of K-mixing.

Regularization of Multi-Reference Energy Density Functional Calculations

  We report the first application of a recently proposed regularizationprocedure for multi-reference energy density functionals, which removesspurious divergent or non-continuous contributions to the binding energy, to ageneral configuration mixing. As an example, we present a calculation thatcorresponds to the particle-number and angular momentum projection of axiallysymmetric time-reversal invariant quasiparticle vacua of different quadrupoledeformation for the nucleus O18. The SIII parameterization of the Skyrme energyfunctional is used.

Microscopic study of 240Pu, mean-field and beyond

  The influence of exact angular-momentum projection and configuration mixingon properties of a heavy, well-deformed nucleus is discussed for the example ofPu240. Starting from a self-consistent model using Skyrme interactions, weanalyze the resulting modifications of the deformation energy, the fissionbarrier height, the excitation energy of the superdeformed minimum associatedwith the fission isomer, the structure of the lowest rotational bands withnormal deformation and superdeformation, and the corresponding quadrupolemoments and transition moments. We present results obtained with the Skyrmeinteractions SLy4 and SLy6, which have slightly different surface tensions.

Pairing correlations beyond the mean field

  We discuss dynamical pairing correlations in the context of configurationmixing of projected self-consistent mean-field states, and the origin of adivergence that might appear when such calculations are done using an energyfunctional in the spirit of a naive generalized density functional theory.

Large-amplitude Qn-Qp collectivity in the neutron-rich oxygen isotope  20O

  By means of HFB calculations with independent constraints on axial neutronand proton quadrupole moments Q_n and Q_p, we investigate the large amplitudeisoscalar and isovector deformation properties of the neutron-rich isotope 20O.Using the particle-number and angular-momentum projected Generator CoordinateMethod, we analyze the collective dynamics in the {Q_n, Q_p} plane. Theparameterization SLy4 of the Skyrme interaction is used for all calculations inconnection with a density-dependent zero-range pairing interaction. Our resultsshow that already for this moderately neutron-rich nucleus the transitionmoments are modified when independent neutron and proton collective dynamicsare allowed.

Skyrme pseudo-potential-based EDF parametrisation for spuriousity-free  MR-EDF calculations

  First exploratory steps towards a pseudo-potential-based Skyrme energydensity functional for spuriousity-free multi-reference calculations arepresented. A qualitatively acceptable fit can be accomplished by adding simplethree- and four-body contact terms to the standard central plus spin-orbittwo-body terms. To achieve quantitative predictive power, higher-order terms,e.g. velocity-dependent three-body terms, will be required.

Extrapolation of mean-field models to superheavy nuclei

  The extrapolation of self-consistent nuclear mean-field models to the regionof superheavy elements is discussed with emphasis on the extrapolating power ofthe models. The predictions of modern mean-field models are confronted withrecent experimental data. It is shown that a final conclusion about thelocation of the expected island of spherical doubly-magic superheavy nucleicannot be drawn on the basis of the available data.

Beyond mean-field description of the low-lying spectrum of 16O

  Starting from constrained Skyrme-mean-field calculations, the low-energyexcitation spectrum of 16O is calculated by configuration mixing ofparticle-number and angular-momentum projected mean-field states in theframework of the Generator Coordinate Method. Without any adjustableparameters, this approach gives a very good description of those states andtheir transition moments that can be described with our restriction to axiallyand reflection-symmetric shapes. The structure of low-lying 0+ states isanalyzed in terms of self-consistent 0p-0h, 2p-2h, and 4p-4h Hartree-Fockstates.

Shape Coexistence in Pb186: Beyond-mean-field description by  configuration mixing of symmetry restored wave functions

  We study shape coexistence in Pb186 using configuration mixing ofangular-momentum and particle-number projected self-consistent mean-fieldstates. The same Skyrme interaction SLy6 is used everywhere in connection witha density-dependent zero-range pairing force. The model predicts coexistingspherical, prolate and oblate 0+ states at low energy.

Spectroscopy of heavy nuclei by configuration mixing of symmetry  restored mean-field states: Shape coexistence in neutron-deficient Pb  isotopes

  We study shape coexistence and low-energy excitation spectra inneutron-deficient Pb isotopes using configuration mixing of angular-momentumand particle-number projected self-consistent mean-field states. The sameSkyrme interaction SLy6 is used everywhere in connection with adensity-dependent zero-range pairing force.

Skyrme mean-field study of rotational bands in transfermium isotopes

  Self-consistent mean field calculations with the SLy4 interaction and adensity-dependent pairing force are presented for nuclei in the Nobelium massregion. Predicted quasi-particle spectra are compared with experiment for theheaviest known odd N and odd Z nuclei. Spectra and rotational bands arepresented for nuclei around No252,4 for which experiments are either planned oralready running.

Optimal Shape of a Blob

  This paper presents the solution to the following optimization problem: Whatis the shape of the two-dimensional region that minimizes the average L_pdistance between all pairs of points if the area of this region is held fixed?[The L_p distance between two points ${\bf x}=(x_1,x_2)$ and ${\bfy}=(y_1,y_2)$ in $\Re^2$ is $(|x_1-y_1|^p+|x_2-y_2|^p)^{1/p}$.] Variationaltechniques are used to show that the boundary curve of the optimal regionsatisfies a nonlinear integral equation. The special case p=2 is elementary andfor this case the integral equation reduces to a differential equation whosesolution is a circle. Two nontrivial special cases, p=1 and p=\infty, havealready been examined in the literature. For these two cases the integralequation reduces to nonlinear second-order differential equations, one of whichcontains a quadratic nonlinearity and the other a cubic nonlinearity.

Disaggregated Benders Decomposition for solving a Network Maintenance  Scheduling Problem

  We consider a problem concerning a network and a set of maintenance requeststo be undertaken. We wish to schedule the maintenance in such a way as tominimise the impact on the total throughput of the network. We applydisaggregated Benders cuts and lazy constraints to solve the problem tooptimality, as well as exploring the strengths and weaknesses of the technique.We prove that our Benders cuts are pareto optimal. Solutions to the LPrelaxation also provide further valid inequalities to reduce total solve time.We implement these techniques on simulated data presented in previous papers,and compare our solution technique to previous methods and a direct MIPformulation. We prove optimality in many problem instances that have notpreviously been proven.

Disaggregated Benders decomposition and lazy constraints for solving the  budget-constrained dynamic uncapacitated facility location and network design  problem

  We present an approach for solving to optimality the budget-constrainedDynamic Uncapacitated Facility Location and Network Design problem (DUFLNDP).This is a problem where a network must be constructed or expanded andfacilities placed in the network, subject to a budget, in order to satisfy anumber of demands. With the demands satisfied, the objective is to minimise therunning cost of the network and the cost of moving demands to facilities. Theproblem can be disaggregated over two different sets simultaneously, leading tomany smaller models which can be solved more easily. Using disaggregatedBenders decomposition and lazy constraints, we solve many instances tooptimality that have not previously been solved. We use an analytic procedureto generate Benders optimality cuts which are provably Pareto-optimal.

alpha-decay chains of Z=114, A=289 and Z=118, A=293 in the relativistic  mean-field model

  A comparison of calculated and experimental Q_alpha values of superheavyeven-even nuclei and a few selected odd-N nuclei is presented in the frameworkof the relativistic mean-field model with the parameterization NL-Z2. Blockingeffects are found to be important for a proper description of Q_alpha of oddmass nuclei. The model gives a good overall description of the availableexperimental data. The mass and charge assignment of the recently measureddecay chains from Dubna and Berkeley is in agreement with the predictions ofthe model. The analysis of the new data does not allow a final conclusion aboutthe location of the expected island of spherical doubly-magic superheavynuclei.

Modified commutation relationships from the Berry-Keating program

  Current approaches to quantum gravity suggest there should be a modificationof the standard quantum mechanical commutator, $[{\hat x} , {\hat p}] = i\hbar$. Typical modifications are phenomenological and designed to result in aminimal length scale. As a motivating principle for the modification of theposition and momentum commutator, we assume the validity of a version of theBender-Brody-M\"uller variant of the Berry-Keating approach to the Riemannhypothesis. We arrive at a family of modified position and momentum operators,and their associated modified commutator, which lead to a minimal length scale.Additionally, this larger family generalizes the Bender-Brody-M\"uller approachto the Riemann hypothesis.

Correlation energies by the generator coordinate method: computational  aspects for quadrupolar deformations

  We investigate truncation schemes to reduce the computational cost ofcalculating correlations by the generator coordinate method based on mean-fieldwave functions. As our test nuclei, we take examples for which accuratecalculations are available. These include a strongly deformed nucleus, 156Sm, anucleus with strong pairing, 120Sn, the krypton isotope chain which containsexamples of soft deformations, and the lead isotope chain which includes thedoubly magic 208Pb. We find that the Gaussian overlap approximation for angularmomentum projection is effective and reduces the computational cost by an orderof magnitude. Cost savings in the deformation degrees of freedom are harder torealize. A straightforward Gaussian overlap approximation can be applied ratherreliably to angular-momentum projected states based on configuration setshaving the same sign deformation (prolate or oblate), but matrix elementsbetween prolate and oblate deformations must be treated with more care. Wepropose a two-dimensional GOA using a triangulation procedure to treat thegeneral case with both kinds of deformation. With the computational gains fromthese approximations, it should be feasible to carry out a systematiccalculation of correlation energies for the nuclear mass table.

Pairing gaps from nuclear mean-field models

  We discuss the pairing gap, a measure for nuclear pairing correlations, inchains of spherical, semi-magic nuclei in the framework of self-consistentnuclear mean-field models. The equations for the conventional BCS model and theapproximate projection-before-variation Lipkin-Nogami method are formulated interms of local density functionals for the effective interaction. We calculatethe Lipkin-Nogami corrections of both the mean-field energy and the pairingenergy. Various definitions of the pairing gap are discussed as three-point,four-point and five-point mass-difference formulae, averaged matrix elements ofthe pairing potential, and single-quasiparticle energies. Experimental valuesfor the pairing gap are compared with calculations employing both a deltapairing force and a density-dependent delta interaction in the BCS andLipkin-Nogami model. Odd-mass nuclei are calculated in the spherical blockingapproximation which neglects part of the the core polarization in the oddnucleus. We find that the five-point mass difference formula gives a veryrobust description of the odd-even staggering, other approximations for the gapmay differ from that up to 30% for certain nuclei.

GCM Analysis of the collective properties of lead isotopes with exact  projection on particle numbers

  We present a microscopic analysis of the collective behaviour of the leadisotopes in the vicinity of Pb208. In this study, we rely on a coherentapproach based on the Generator Coordinate Method including exact projection onN and Z numbers within a collective space generated by means of the constrainedHartree-Fock BCS method. With the same Hamiltonian used in HF+BCS calculations,we have performed a comprehensive study including monopole, quadrupole andoctupole excitations as well as pairing vibrations. We find that, for theconsidered nuclei, the collective modes which modify the most the conclusionsdrawn from the mean-field theory are the octupole and pairing vibrations.

Skyrme functional from a three-body pseudo-potential of second-order in  gradients. Formalism for central terms

  In one way or the other, all modern parametrizations of the nuclear energydensity functional (EDF) do not respect the exchange symmetry associated withPauli's principle. It has been recently shown that this practice jeopardizesmulti-reference (MR) EDF calculations by contaminating the energy with spuriousself-interactions that, for example, lead to finite steps or even divergenceswhen plotting it as a function of collective coordinates. As of today, the onlyviable option to bypass these pathologies is to rely on EDF kernels thatenforce Pauli's principle from the outset by strictly and exactly deriving froma genuine, i.e. density-independent, Hamilton operator.  We wish to develop the most general Skyrme-like EDF parametrizationcontaining linear, bilinear and trilinear terms in the density matrices with upto two gradients, under the key constraint that it derives strictly from aneffective Hamilton operator. The most general three-body Skyrme-likepseudo-potential containing up to two gradient operators is constructed togenerate the trilinear part. The present study is limited to central terms.Spin-orbit and tensor will be addressed in a forthcoming paper.  (See paper for full abstract)

Beta decay of r-process waiting-point nuclei in a self-consistent  approach

  Beta-decay rates for spherical neutron-rich r-process waiting-point nucleiare calculated within a fully self-consistent Quasiparticle Random-PhaseApproximation, formulated in the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov canonicalsingle-particle basis. The same Skyrme force is used everywhere in thecalculation except in the proton-neutron particle-particle channel, where afinite-range force is consistently employed. In all but the heaviest nuclei,the resulting half-lives are usually shorter by factors of 2 to 5 than those ofcalculations that ignore the proton-neutron particle-particle interaction. Theshorter half-lives alter predictions for the abundance distribution ofr-process elements and for the time it takes to synthesize them.

Consequences of the center-of-mass correction in nuclear mean-field  models

  We study the influence of the scheme for the correction for spuriouscenter-of-mass motion on the fit of effective interactions for self-consistentnuclear mean-field calculations. We find that interactions with very simplecenter-of-mass correction have significantly larger surface coefficients thaninteractions for which the center-of-mass correction was calculated for theactual many-body state during the fit. The reason for that is that theeffective interaction has to counteract the wrong trends with nucleon number ofall simplified schemes for center-of-mass correction which puts a wrong trendwith mass number into the effective interaction itself. The effect becomesclearly visible when looking at the deformation energy of largely deformedsystems, e.g. superdeformed states or fission barriers of heavy nuclei.

Pairing Gap and Polarisation Effects

  The phenomenological adjustment of the nuclear pairing strength is usuallyperformed with respect to the odd-even staggering of the binding energies. Wefind that the results strongly depend on the way in which the ground states ofthe odd nuclei are computed. A thorough calculation including all time-even andtime-odd polarisation effects induced by the odd nucleon produces about 30%reduced odd-even staggering as compared to the standard spherical calculationsin the relativistic mean-field model. The pairing strength must be enhanced byabout 20% to compensate for that effect. The enhanced strength has dramaticconsequences for the predicted deformation properties of the underlyingmean-field models, possibly implying that new adjustments of their parametersbecome necessary as well.

Shell stabilization of super- and hyperheavy nuclei without magic gaps

  Quantum stabilization of superheavy elements is quantified in terms of theshell-correction energy. We compute the shell correction using self-consistentnuclear models: the non-relativistic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach and therelativistic mean-field model, for a number of parametrizations. All the forcesapplied predict a broad valley of shell stabilization around Z=120 andN=172-184. We also predict two broad regions of shell stabilization inhyperheavy elements with N approx 258 and N approx 308. Due to the largesingle-particle level density, shell corrections in the superheavy elementsdiffer markedly from those in lighter nuclei. With increasing proton andneutron numbers, the regions of nuclei stabilized by shell effects becomepoorly localized in particle number, and the familiar pattern of shellsseparated by magic gaps is basically gone.

Configuration mixing of angular momentum projected self-consistent  mean-field states for neutron-deficient Pb isotopes

  We study the low-lying collective excitation spectra of the neutron-deficientlead isotopes Pb182-Pb194 by performing a configuration mixing ofangular-momentum and particle-number projected self-consistent mean-fieldstates. The same Skyrme interaction SLy6 is used supplemented by adensity-dependent zero-range pairing force. This study supports theinterpretation of spectra made on the grounds of more schematic models in termsof coexisting spherical, oblate, prolate and superdeformed prolate structures.The model qualitatively reproduces the variation of the spectra with neutronnumber. Our results for E0 and E2 transition probabilities are compared withthe few existing experimental data. Finally, we predict the presence ofsuperdeformed bands at low excitation energy in the most neutron-deficientisotopes.

Global study of quadrupole correlation effects

  We discuss the systematics of ground-state quadrupole correlations of bindingenergies and mean-square charge radii for all even-even nuclei, from O16 up tothe superheavies, for which data are available. To that aim we calculate theircorrelated J=0 ground state by means of the angular-momentum andparticle-number projected generator coordinate method, using the axial massquadrupole moment as the generator coordinate and self-consistent mean-fieldstates only restricted by axial, parity, and time-reversal symmetries. Thecalculation is performed within the framework of a non-relativisticself-consistent mean-field model using the same non-relativistic Skyrmeinteraction SLy4 and a density-dependent pairing force to generate themean-field configurations and mix them. (See the paper for the rest of theabstract).

Beyond mean-field study of excited states: Analysis within the Lipkin  model

  Beyond mean-field methods based on restoration of symmetries andconfiguration mixing by the generator coordinate method (GCM) enable tocalculate on the same footing correlations in the ground state and theproperties of excited states. Excitation energies are often largelyoverestimated, especially in nuclei close to magicity, even when transitionprobabilities are well-described. We analyse here the origin of this failure.The first part of the paper compares realistic projected GCM and QRPAcalculations for selected Sn isotopes performed with the same effective Skyrmeinteraction. Although it is difficult to perform RPA and GCM calculations underexactly the same conditions, this comparison shows that the projected GCMoverestimates the RPA results. In the second part of this paper, we compare GCMand RPA in the framework of the exactly solvable Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Weshow that the discretized GCM works quite well and permits to obtain nearlyexact results with a small number of discretization points. This analysisindicates also that to break more symmetries of the nuclear Hamiltonian in theconstruction of the GCM basis is probably the best way to improve thedescription of excited states by the GCM.

Potential energy surfaces of superheavy nuclei

  We investigate the structure of the potential energy surfaces of thesuperheavy nuclei 258Fm, 264Hs, (Z=112,N=166), (Z=114,N=184), and (Z=120,N=172)within the framework of self-consistent nuclear models, i.e. theSkyrme-Hartree-Fock approach and the relativistic mean-field model. We compareresults obtained with one representative parametrisation of each model which issuccessful in describing superheavy nuclei. We find systematic changes ascompared to the potential energy surfaces of heavy nuclei in the uraniumregion: there is no sufficiently stable fission isomer any more, the importanceof triaxial configurations to lower the first barrier fades away, andasymmetric fission paths compete down to rather small deformation. Comparingthe two models, it turns out that the relativistic mean-field model givesgenerally smaller fission barriers.

Beyond-mean-field-model analysis of low-spin normal-deformed and  superdeformed collective states of S32, Ar36, Ar38 and Ca40

  We investigate the coexistence of spherical, deformed and superdeformedstates at low spin in S32, Ar36, Ar38 and Ca40. The microscopic states areconstructed by configuration mixing of BCS states projected on good particlenumber and angular momentum. The BCS states are themselves obtained fromHartree-Fock BCS calculations using the Skyrme interaction SLy6 for theparticle-hole channel, and a density-dependent contact force in the pairingchannel. The same interaction is used within the Generator Coordinate Method todetermine the configuration mixing and calculate the properties of even-spinstates with positive parity. Our calculations underestimate moments of inertia.Nevertheless, for the four nuclei, the global structural properties of thestates of normal deformation as well as the recently discovered superdeformedbands up to spin 6 are correctly reproduced with regard to both the energiesand the transition rates.

Further explorations of Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass formulas.  III: Role of particle-number projection

  Starting from HFB-6, we have constructed a new mass table, referred to asHFB-8, including all the 9200 nuclei lying between the two drip lines over therange of Z and N > 6 and Z < 122. It differs from HFB-6 in that the wavefunction is projected on the exact particle number. Like HFB-6, the isoscalareffective mass is constrained to the value 0.80 M and the pairing is densityindependent. The rms errors of the mass-data fit is 0.635 MeV, i.e. better thanalmost all our previous HFB mass formulas. The extrapolations of this new massformula out to the drip lines do not differ significantly from the previousHFB-6 mass formula.

Shape coexistence in neutron-deficient Kr isotopes: Constraints on the  single-particle spectrum of self-consistent mean-field models from collective  excitations

  We discuss shape coexistence in the neutron-deficient Kr72-Kr78 isotopes inthe framework of configuration mixing calculations of particle-number andangular-momentum projected axial mean-field states obtained fromself-consistent calculations with the Skyrme interaction SLy6 and adensity-dependent pairing interaction. While our calculation reproducesqualitatively and quantitatively many of the global features of these nuclei,such as coexistence of prolate and oblate shapes, their strong mixing at lowangular momentum, and the deformation of collective bands, the ordering of ourcalculated low-lying levels is at variance with experiment. We analyse the roleof the single-particle spectrum of the underlying mean-field for the spectrumof collective excitations.

Configuration mixing within the energy density functional formalism:  pathologies and cures

  Configuration mixing calculations performed in terms of the Skyrme/GognyEnergy Density Functional (EDF) rely on extending the Single-Reference energyfunctional into non-diagonal EDF kernels. The standard way to do so, based onan analogy with the pure Hamiltonian case and the use of the generalized Wicktheorem, is responsible for the recently observed divergences and steps inMulti-Reference calculations. We summarize here the minimal solution to thisproblem recently proposed [Lacroix et al, arXiv:0809.2041] and applied withsuccess to particle number restoration[Bender et al, arXiv:0809.2045]. Such aregularization method provides suitable corrections of pathologies for EDFdepending on integer powers of the density. The specific case of fractionalpowers of the density[Duguet et al, arXiv:0809.2049] is also discussed.

Insertion Sort is O(n log n)

  Traditional Insertion Sort runs in O(n^2) time because each insertion takesO(n) time. When people run Insertion Sort in the physical world, they leavegaps between items to accelerate insertions. Gaps help in computers as well.This paper shows that Gapped Insertion Sort has insertion times of O(log n)with high probability, yielding a total running time of O(n log n) with highprobability.

Quantum calculation of Coulomb reorientation and near-barrier fusion

  We investigate the role of deformation on the fusion probability around thebarrier using the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock theory with a full Skyrme force.We obtain a distribution of fusion probabilities around the nominal barrier dueto the different contributions of the various orientations of the deformednucleus at the touching point. It is also shown that the long range Coulombreorientation reduces the fusion probability around the barrier.

Evaluation of overlaps between arbitrary Fermionic quasiparticle vacua

  We derive an expression that allows for the unambiguous evaluation of theoverlap between two arbitrary quasiparticle vacua, including its sign. Ourexpression is based on the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix, extending theformula recently proposed by [L. M. Robledo, Phys. Rev. C 79, 021302(R) (2009)]to the most general case, including the one of the overlap between twodifferent blocked n-quasiparticle states for either even or odd systems. Thepowerfulness of the method is illustrated for a few typical matrix elementsthat appear in realistic angular-momentum-restored Generator-Coordinate Methodcalculations when breaking time-reversal invariance and using the full modelspace of occupied single-particle states.

Shell structure of superheavy nuclei in self-consistent mean-field  models

  We study the extrapolation of nuclear shell structure to the region ofsuperheavy nuclei in self-consistent mean-field models -- theSkyrme-Hartree-Fock approach and the relativistic mean-field model -- using alarge number of parameterizations. Results obtained with the Folded-Yukawapotential are shown for comparison. We focus on differences in the isospindependence of the spin-orbit interaction and the effective mass between themodels and their influence on single-particle spectra. While all relativisticmodels give a reasonable description of spin-orbit splittings, allnon-relativistic models show a wrong trend with mass number. The spin-orbitsplitting of heavy nuclei might be overestimated by 40%-80%. Sphericaldoubly-magic superheavy nuclei are found at (Z=114,N=184), (Z=120,N=172) or(Z=126,N=184) depending on the parameterization. The Z=114 proton shellclosure, which is related to a large spin-orbit splitting of proton 2f states,is predicted only by forces which by far overestimate the proton spin-orbitsplitting in Pb208. The Z=120 and N=172 shell closures predicted by therelativistic models and some Skyrme interactions are found to be related to acentral depression of the nuclear density distribution. This effect cannotappear in macroscopic-microscopic models which have a limited freedom for thedensity distribution only. In summary, our findings give a strong argument for(Z=120,N=172) to be the next spherical doubly-magic superheavy nucleus.

Equivalence of a Complex $\cP\cT$-Symmetric Quartic Hamiltonian and a  Hermitian Quartic Hamiltonian with an Anomaly

  In a recent paper Jones and Mateo used operator techniques to show that thenon-Hermitian $\cP\cT$-symmetric wrong-sign quartic Hamiltonian $H=\halfp^2-gx^4$ has the same spectrum as the conventional Hermitian Hamiltonian$\tilde H=\half p^2+4g x^4-\sqrt{2g} x$. Here, this equivalence is demonstratedvery simply by means of differential-equation techniques and, more importantly,by means of functional-integration techniques. It is shown that the linear termin the Hermitian Hamiltonian is anomalous; that is, this linear term has noclassical analog. The anomaly arises because of the broken parity symmetry ofthe original non-Hermitian $\cP\cT$-symmetric Hamiltonian. This anomaly in theHermitian form of a $\cP\cT$-symmetric quartic Hamiltonian is unchanged if aharmonic term is introduced into $H$. When there is a harmonic term, animmediate physical consequence of the anomaly is the appearance of boundstates; if there were no anomaly term, there would be no bound states. Possibleextensions of this work to $-\phi^4$ quantum field theory in higher-dimensionalspace-time are discussed.

Shell Corrections of Superheavy Nuclei in Self-Consistent Calculations

  Shell corrections to the nuclear binding energy as a measure of shell effectsin superheavy nuclei are studied within the self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fockand Relativistic Mean-Field theories. Due to the presence of low-lying protoncontinuum resulting in a free particle gas, special attention is paid to thetreatment of single-particle level density. To cure the pathological behaviorof shell correction around the particle threshold, the method based on theGreen's function approach has been adopted. It is demonstrated that for thevast majority of Skyrme interactions commonly employed in nuclear structurecalculations, the strongest shell stabilization appears for Z=124, and 126, andfor N=184. On the other hand, in the relativistic approaches the strongestspherical shell effect appears systematically for Z=120 and N=172. Thisdifference has probably its roots in the spin-orbit potential. We have alsoshown that, in contrast to shell corrections which are fairly independent onthe force, macroscopic energies extracted from self-consistent calculationsstrongly depend on the actual force parametrisation used. That is, the A and Zdependence of mass surface when extrapolating to unknown superheavy nuclei isprone to significant theoretical uncertainties.

Further explorations of Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass formulas.  II: Role of the effective mass

  We have constructed four new complete mass tables, referred to as HFB-4 toHFB-7, each one including all the 9200 nuclei lying between the two drip linesover the range of Z and N>8 and Z<120. HFB-4 and HFB-5 have the isoscalareffective mass M*_s$ constrained to the value 0.92 M, with the former having adensity-independent pairing, and the latter a density-dependent pairing. HFB-6and HFB-7 are similar, except that M*_s is constrained to 0.8 M. The rms errorsof the mass-data fits are 0.680, 0.675, 0.686, and 0.676 MeV, respectively,almost as good as for the HFB-2 mass formula, for which M*_s was unconstrained.However, as usual, the single-particle spectra depend significantly on M*_s.This decoupling of the mass fits from the fits to the single-particle spectrahas been achieved only by making the cutoff parameter of the delta-functionpairing force a free parameter. An improved treatment of the center-of-masscorrection was adopted, but although this makes a difference to individualnuclei it does not reduce the overall rms error of the fit. The extrapolationsof all four new mass formulas out to the drip lines are essentially the same asfor the original HFB-2 mass formula.

From finite nuclei to the nuclear liquid drop: leptodermous expansion  based on the self-consistent mean-field theory

  The parameters of the nuclear liquid drop model, such as the volume, surface,symmetry, and curvature constants, as well as bulk radii, are extracted fromthe non-relativistic and relativistic energy density functionals used inmicroscopic calculations for finite nuclei. The microscopic liquid drop energy,obtained self-consistently for a large sample of finite, spherical nuclei, hasbeen expanded in terms of powers of A^{-1/3} (or inverse nuclear radius) andthe isospin excess (or neutron-to-proton asymmetry). In order to perform areliable extrapolation in the inverse radius, the calculations have beencarried out for nuclei with huge numbers of nucleons, of the order of 10^6. TheCoulomb interaction has been ignored to be able to approach nuclei of arbitrarysizes and to avoid radial instabilities characteristic of systems with verylarge atomic numbers. The main contribution to the fluctuating part of thebinding energy has been removed using the Green's function method to calculatethe shell correction. The limitations of applying the leptodermous expansion toactual nuclei are discussed. While the leading terms in the macroscopic energyexpansion can be extracted very precisely, the higher-order, isospin-dependentterms are prone to large uncertainties due to finite-size effects.

Tensor part of the Skyrme energy density functional. II: Deformation  properties of magic and semi-magic nuclei

  We study systematically the impact of the time-even tensor terms of theSkyrme energy density functional, i.e. terms bilinear in the spin-currenttensor density, on deformation properties of closed shell nuclei correspondingto 20, 28, 40, 50, 82, and 126 neutron or proton shell closures. We compareresults obtained with three different families of Skyrme parameterizationswhose tensor terms have been adjusted on properties of spherical nuclei: (i)TIJ interactions proposed in the first paper of this series [T. Lesinski etal., Phys. Rev. C 76, 014312 (2007)] which were constructed through a completereadjustment of the rest of the functional (ii) parameterizations whose tensorterms have been added perturbatively to existing Skyrme interactions, with orwithout readjusting the spin-orbit coupling constant. We analyse in detail themechanisms at play behind the impact of tensor terms on deformation propertiesand how studying the latter can help screen out unrealistic parameterizations.It is expected that findings of the present paper are to a large extentindependent of remaining deficiencies of the central and spin-orbitinteractions, and will be of great value for the construction of future,improved energy functionals.

Systematics of Fission Barriers in Superheavy Elements

  We investigate the systematics of fission barriers in superheavy elements inthe range Z = 108-120 and N = 166-182. Results from two self-consistent modelsfor nuclear structure, the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model as well as thenon-relativistic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach are compared and discussed. Werestrict ourselves to axially symmetric shapes, which provides an upper boundon static fission barriers. We benchmark the predictive power of the modelsexamining the barriers and fission isomers of selected heavy actinide nucleifor which data are available. For both actinides and superheavy nuclei, the RMFmodel systematically predicts lower barriers than most Skyrme interactions. Inparticular the fission isomers are predicted too low by the RMF, which castssome doubt on recent predictions about superdeformed ground states of somesuperheavy nuclei. For the superheavy nuclei under investigation, fissionbarriers drop to small values around Z = 110, N = 180 and increase again forheavier systems. For most of the forces, there is no fission isomer forsuperheavy nuclei, as superdeformed states are in most cases found to beunstable with respect to octupole distortions.

Maintaining Arrays of Contiguous Objects

  In this paper we consider methods for dynamically storing a set of differentobjects ("modules") in a physical array. Each module requires one freecontiguous subinterval in order to be placed. Items are inserted or removed,resulting in a fragmented layout that makes it harder to insert furthermodules. It is possible to relocate modules, one at a time, to another freesubinterval that is contiguous and does not overlap with the current locationof the module. These constraints clearly distinguish our problem from classicalmemory allocation. We present a number of algorithmic results, including abound of Theta(n^2) on physical sorting if there is a sufficiently large freespace and sum up NP-hardness results for arbitrary initial layouts. For onlinescenarios in which modules arrive one at a time, we present a method thatrequires O(1) moves per insertion or deletion and amortized cost O(m_i log M)per insertion or deletion, where m_i is the module's size, M is the size of thelargest module and costs for moves are linear in the size of a module.
