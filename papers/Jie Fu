Small Representations for Affine q-Schur Algebras

  When the parameter $q\in\mathbb C^*$ is not a root of unity, simple modulesof affine $q$-Schur algebras have been classified in terms of Frenkel--Mukhin'sdominant Drinfeld polynomials (\cite[4.6.8]{DDF}). We compute these Drinfeldpolynomials associated with the simple modules of an affine $q$-Schur algebrawhich come from the simple modules of the corresponding $q$-Schur algebra viathe evaluation maps.

A Double Hall Algebra Approach to Affine Quantum Schur--Weyl Theory

  We investigate the structure of the double Ringel-Hall algebras associatedwith cyclic quivers and its connections with quantum loop algebras of$\mathfrak{gl}_n$, affine quantum Schur algebras and affine Hecke algebras.This includes their Drinfeld-Jimbo type presentation, affine quantum Schur-Weylreciprocity, representations of affine quantum Schur algebras, and connectionswith various existing works by Lusztig, Varagnolo-Vasserot, Schiffmann, Hubery,Chari-Pressley, Frenkel-Mukhin, etc. We will also discuss conjectures on arealization of Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson type and Lusztig type integralforms for double Ringel-Hall algebras.

Potential Integral Equations in Electromagnetics

  In this work, a new integral equation (IE) based formulation is proposedusing vector and scalar potentials for electromagnetic scattering. The newintegral equations feature decoupled vector and scalar potentials that satisfyLorentz gauge. The decoupling of the two potentials allows low-frequencystability. The formulation presented also results in Fredholm integralequations of second kind. The spectral properties of second kind integraloperators leads to a well-conditioned system.

Critical onset in coherent oscillations between two weakly coupled  Bose-Einstein condensates

  The Josephson effects in two weakly linked Bose-Einstein condensates havebeen studied recently. In this letter, we study the equations derived byGiovanazzi et. al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 4521 (2000)] focusing on the effectsof the initial acceleration and the velocity of the barrier on the ``dc''current. We find that the dc current has lifetime which critically depends onthe moving velocity of the barrier. Moreover, the influence of the initialacceleration is also investigated and found to be crucial for the experimentalrealization of the effects.

Classical collisional trajectories as the source of strong-field double  ionization of helium in the knee regime

  In this paper, a quasistatic model is extended to describe the doubleionization of Helium in intense linearly polarized field, yielding achieve aninsight to the two-electron correlation effect in the ionization dynamics. Ournumerical calculations reproduce the excessive double ionization and thephotoelectron spectra observed experimentally both quantitatively andqualitatively. Moreover, it is shown that the classical collisionaltrajectories are the main source of the double ionization in the knee regimeand responsible for the unusual angular distribution of the photoelectrons.

Correlated electron emission in laser-induced nonsequence double  ionization of Helium

  In this paper, we have investigated the correlated electron emission of thenonsequence double ionization (NSDI) in an intense linearly polarized field.The theoretical model we employed is the semiclassical rescattering model, themodel atom we used is the helium. We find a significant correlation betweenmagnitude and direction of the momentum of two emission electrons, and give agood explanation for this striking phenomenon by observing the classicalcollisional trajectories. We argue that this correlation phenomenon isuniversal in NSDI process, as revealed by the recent experiment on the argon.

The configuration of a topological current and physical structure: an  application and paradigmatic evidence

  In the $\phi $-mapping theory, the topological current constructed by theorder parameters can possess different inner structure. The difference intopology must correspond to the difference in physical structure. Thetransition between different structures happens at the bifurcation point of thetopological current. In a self-interaction two-level system, the change oftopological particles corresponds to change of energy levels.

Singularity of Berry Connections Inhibits the Accuracy of Adiabatic  Approximation

  Adiabatic approximation for quantum evolution is investigated quantitativelywith addressing its dependence on the Berry connections. We find that, in theadiabatic limit, the adiabatic fidelity may uniformly converge to unit ordiverge manifesting the breakdown of adiabatic approximation, depending on thetype of the singularity of the Berry connections as the functions ofslowly-varying parameter $R$. When the Berry connections have a singularity of$1/R^\sigma$ type with $\sigma < 1$, the adiabatic fidelity converges to unitin a power-law; whereas when the singularity index $\sigma$ is larger than one,adiabatic approximation breaks down. Two-level models are used to substantiateour theory.

Berry Phase in Atom-Molecule Conversion Systems and Fractional Monopole

  We investigate the geometric phase or Berry phase of adiabatic quantumevolution in an atom-molecule conversion system, and find that the Berry phasein such system consists of two parts: the usual Berry connection term and anovel term from the nonlinearity brought forth by the atom-molecule conversion.The geometric phase can be viewed as the flux of the magnetic field of amonopole through the surface enclosed by a closed path in parameter space. Thecharge of the monopole, however, is found to be one third of the elementarycharge of the usual quantized monopole.

Representations of little $q$-Schur algebras

  In \cite{DFW} and \cite{Fu07}, little $q$-Schur algebras were introduced ashomomorphic images of the infinitesimal quantum groups. In this paper, we willinvestigate representations of these algebras. We will classify simple modulesfor little $q$-Schur algebras and classify semisimple little $q$-Schuralgebras. Moreover, through the classification of the blocks of little$q$-Schur algebras for $n=2$, we will determine little $q$-Schur algebras offinite representation type in the odd roots of unity case.

Quantum affine $\frak{gl}_n$ via Hecke algebras

  We use the Hecke algebras of affine symmetric groups and their associatedSchur algebras to construct a new algebra through a basis, and a set ofgenerators and explicit multiplication formulas of basis elements bygenerators. We prove that this algebra is isomorphic to the quantum envelopingalgebra of the loop algebra of $\mathfrak {gl}_n$. Though this construction ismotivated by the work \cite{BLM} by Beilinson--Lusztig--MacPherson for quantum$\frak{gl}_n$, our approach is purely algebraic and combinatorial, independentof the geometric method which seems to work only for quantum $\mathfrak{gl}_n$and quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. As an application, we discover apresentation of the Ringel--Hall algebra of a cyclic quiver by semisimplegenerators and their multiplications by the defining basis elements.

The Integral quantum loop algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$

  We will construct the Lusztig form for the quantum loop algebra of$\mathfrak{gl}_n$ by proving the conjecture \cite[3.8.6]{DDF} and establishpartially the Schur--Weyl duality at the integral level in this case. We willalso investigate the integral form of the modified quantum affine$\mathfrak{gl}_n$ by introducing an affine stabilisation property and will liftthe canonical bases from affine quantum Schur algebras to a canonical basis forthis integral form. As an application of our theory, we will also discuss theintegral form of the modified extended quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ andconstruct its canonical basis to verify a conjecture of Lusztig in this case.

Bayesian Estimation Based Parameter Estimation for Composite Load

  Accurate identification of parameters of load models is essential in powersystem computations, including simulation, prediction, and stability andreliability analysis. Conventional point estimation based composite loadmodeling approaches suffer from disturbances and noises and provide limitedinformation of the system dynamics. In this work, a statistic (BayesianEstimation) based distribution estimation approach is proposed for both static(ZIP) and dynamic (Induction Motor) load modeling. When dealing with multipleparameters, Gibbs sampling method is employed. In each iteration, the proposalsamples each parameter while keeps others fixed. The proposed method provides adistribution estimation of load models coefficients and is robust tomeasurement errors.

Epidemic spread in weighted networks

  We study the detailed epidemic spreading process in scale-free networks withweight that denote familiarity between two people or computers. The resultshows that spreading velocity reaches a peak quickly then decays representingpower-law time behavior, and comparing to non-weighted networks, precisehierarchical dynamics is not found although the nodes with larger strength ispreferential to be infected.

Abstractions and sensor design in partial-information, reactive  controller synthesis

  Automated synthesis of reactive control protocols from temporal logicspecifications has recently attracted considerable attention in variousapplications in, for example, robotic motion planning, network management, andhardware design. An implicit and often unrealistic assumption in this past workis the availability of complete and precise sensing information during theexecution of the controllers. In this paper, we use an abstraction procedurefor systems with partial observation and propose a formalism to investigateeffects of limitations in sensing. The abstraction procedure enables theexisting synthesis methods with partial observation to be applicable andefficient for systems with infinite (or finite but large number of) states.This formalism enables us to systematically discover sensing modalitiesnecessary in order to render the underlying synthesis problems feasible. We usecounterexamples, which witness unrealizability potentially due to thelimitations in sensing and the coarseness in the abstract system, andinterpolation-based techniques to refine the model and the sensing modalities,i.e., to identify new sensors to be included, in such synthesis problems. Wedemonstrate the method on examples from robotic motion planning.

Pareto efficiency in synthesizing shared autonomy policies with temporal  logic constraints

  In systems in which control authority is shared by an autonomous controllerand a human operator, it is important to find solutions that achieve adesirable system performance with a reasonable workload for the human operator.We formulate a shared autonomy system capable of capturing the interaction andswitching control between an autonomous controller and a human operator, aswell as the evolution of the operator's cognitive state during controlexecution. To trade-off human's effort and the performance level, e.g.,measured by the probability of satisfying the underlying temporal logicspecification, a two-stage policy synthesis algorithm is proposed forgenerating Pareto efficient coordination and control policies with respect touser specified weights. We integrate the Tchebychev scalarization method formulti-objective optimization methods to obtain a better coverage of the set ofPareto efficient solutions than linear scalarization methods.

Optimal control in Markov decision processes via distributed  optimization

  Optimal control synthesis in stochastic systems with respect to quantitativetemporal logic constraints can be formulated as linear programming problems.However, centralized synthesis algorithms do not scale to many practicalsystems. To tackle this issue, we propose a decomposition-based distributedsynthesis algorithm. By decomposing a large-scale stochastic system modeled asa Markov decision process into a collection of interacting sub-systems, theoriginal control problem is formulated as a linear programming problem with asparse constraint matrix, which can be solved through distributed optimizationmethods. Additionally, we propose a decomposition algorithm which automaticallyexploits, if exists, the modular structure in a given large-scale system. Weillustrate the proposed methods through robotic motion planning examples.

Computational methods for stochastic control with metric interval  temporal logic specifications

  This paper studies an optimal control problem for continuous-time stochasticsystems subject to reachability objectives specified in a subclass of metricinterval temporal logic specifications, a temporal logic with real-timeconstraints. We propose a probabilistic method for synthesizing an optimalcontrol policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a specificationbased on a discrete approximation of the underlying stochastic system. First,we show that the original problem can be formulated as a stochastic optimalcontrol problem in a state space augmented with finite memory and states ofsome clock variables. Second, we present a numerical method for computing anoptimal policy with which the given specification is satisfied with the maximalprobability in point-based semantics in the discrete approximation of theunderlying system. We show that the policy obtained in the discreteapproximation converges to the optimal one for satisfying the specification inthe continuous or dense-time semantics as the discretization becomes finer inboth state and time. Finally, we illustrate our approach with a robotic motionplanning example.

Optimal Temporal Logic Planning in Probabilistic Semantic Maps

  This paper considers robot motion planning under temporal logic constraintsin probabilistic maps obtained by semantic simultaneous localization andmapping (SLAM). The uncertainty in a map distribution presents a greatchallenge for obtaining correctness guarantees with respect to the lineartemporal logic (LTL) specification. We show that the problem can be formulatedas an optimal control problem in which both the semantic map and the logicformula evaluation are stochastic. Our first contribution is to reduce thestochastic control problem for a subclass of LTL to a deterministic shortestpath problem by introducing a confidence parameter $delta$. A robot trajectoryobtained from the deterministic problem is guaranteed to have minimum cost andto satisfy the logic specification in the true environment with probability$delta$. Our second contribution is to design an admissible heuristic functionthat guides the planning in the deterministic problem towards satisfying thetemporal logic specification. This allows us to obtain an optimal and veryefficient solution using the A* algorithm. The performance and correctness ofour approach are demonstrated in a simulated semantic environment using adifferential-drive robot.

Nuclear Fusion in Laser-Driven Counter-Streaming Collisionless Plasmas

  Nuclear fusion reactions are the most important processes in nature to powerstars and produce new elements, and lie at the center of the understanding ofnucleosynthesis in the universe. It is critically important to study thereactions in full plasma environments that are close to true astrophysicalconditions. By using laser-driven counter-streaming collisionless plasmas, westudied the fusion D$+$D$\rightarrow n +^3$He in a Gamow-like window around 27keV. The results show that astrophysical nuclear reaction yield can bemodulated significantly by the self-generated electromagnetic fields and thecollective motion of the plasma. This plasma-version mini-collider may providea novel tool for studies of astrophysics-interested nuclear reactions in plasmawith tunable energies in earth-based laboratories.

Importance sampling-based approximate optimal planning and control

  In this paper, we propose a sampling-based planning and optimal controlmethod of nonlinear systems under non-differentiable constraints. Motivated bydeveloping scalable planning algorithms, we consider the optimal motion plan tobe a feedback controller that can be approximated by a weighted sum of givenbases. Given this approximate optimal control formulation, our maincontribution is to introduce importance sampling, specifically, model-referenceadaptive search algorithm, to iteratively compute the optimal weightparameters, i.e., the weights corresponding to the optimal policy functionapproximation given chosen bases. The key idea is to perform the search byiteratively estimating a parametrized distribution which converges to a Dirac'sDelta that infinitely peaks on the global optimal weights. Then, using thisdirect policy search, we incorporated trajectory-based verification to ensurethat, for a class of nonlinear systems, the obtained policy is not only optimalbut robust to bounded disturbances. The correctness and efficiency of themethods are demonstrated through numerical experiments including linear systemswith a nonlinear cost function and motion planning for a Dubins car.

Berry Phase of Nonlinear Correction

  We investigate the geometric phase or Berry phase of adiabatic quantumevolution in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems governed by nonlinearGross-Pitaevskii(GP) equations. We study how this phase is modified by thenonlinearity and find that the Bogoliubov fluctuations around the eigenstatesare accumulated during the nonlinear adiabatic evolution and contribute afinite phase of geometric nature. A two-mode BEC model is used to illustrateour theory. Our theory is applicable to other nonlinear systems such asparaxial wave equation for nonlinear optics and Ginzburg-Landau equations forcomplex order parameters in condensed-matter physics.

Symbolic Planning and Control Using Game Theory and Grammatical  Inference

  This paper presents an approach that brings together game theory withgrammatical inference and discrete abstractions in order to synthesize controlstrategies for hybrid dynamical systems performing tasks in partially unknownbut rule-governed adversarial environments. The combined formulation guaranteesthat a system specification is met if (a) the true model of the environment isin the class of models inferable from a positive presentation, (b) acharacteristic sample is observed, and (c) the task specification issatisfiable given the capabilities of the system (agent) and the environment.

Environment-Independent Task Specifications via GLTL

  We propose a new task-specification language for Markov decision processesthat is designed to be an improvement over reward functions by beingenvironment independent. The language is a variant of Linear Temporal Logic(LTL) that is extended to probabilistic specifications in a way that permitsapproximations to be learned in finite time. We provide several smallenvironments that demonstrate the advantages of our geometric LTL (GLTL)language and illustrate how it can be used to specify standardreinforcement-learning tasks straightforwardly.

Comparison of quantum kinetic theory and time-dependent Dirac equation  approaches in vacuum pair production and the bound states resonance enhanced  mechanism

  A remarkable quantitative agreement is found between the non-Markovianquantum kinetic approach and the time-dependent Dirac equation approach for alarge region of Keldysh parameter, in the investigation of electron-positronpair production in the electric fields which is spatially homogeneous andenvelope pulse shaped. If a sub-critical bound potential is immersed in thisbackground field, the TDDE results show that the creation probability will beenhanced by the bound states resonance by two orders of magnitude. We alsoestablish a computing resources greatly saved TDDE formalism for spatiallyhomogeneous field.

Probably Approximately Correct MDP Learning and Control With Temporal  Logic Constraints

  We consider synthesis of control policies that maximize the probability ofsatisfying given temporal logic specifications in unknown, stochasticenvironments. We model the interaction between the system and its environmentas a Markov decision process (MDP) with initially unknown transitionprobabilities. The solution we develop builds on the so-called model-basedprobably approximately correct Markov decision process (PAC-MDP) methodology.The algorithm attains an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal policy withprobability $1-\delta$ using samples (i.e. observations), time and space thatgrow polynomially with the size of the MDP, the size of the automatonexpressing the temporal logic specification, $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$,$\frac{1}{\delta}$ and a finite time horizon. In this approach, the systemmaintains a model of the initially unknown MDP, and constructs a product MDPbased on its learned model and the specification automaton that expresses thetemporal logic constraints. During execution, the policy is iteratively updatedusing observation of the transitions taken by the system. The iterationterminates in finitely many steps. With high probability, the resulting policyis such that, for any state, the difference between the probability ofsatisfying the specification under this policy and the optimal one is within apredefined bound.

Integrating active sensing into reactive synthesis with temporal logic  constraints under partial observations

  We introduce the notion of online reactive planning with sensing actions forsystems with temporal logic constraints in partially observable and dynamicenvironments. With incomplete information on the dynamic environment, reactivecontroller synthesis amounts to solving a two-player game with partialobservations, which has impractically computational complexity. To alleviatethe high computational burden, online replanning via sensing actions avoidssolving the strategy in the reactive system under partial observations.Instead, we only solve for a strategy that ensures a given temporal logicspecification can be satisfied had the system have complete observations of itsenvironment. Such a strategy is then transformed into one which makes controldecisions based on the observed sequence of states (of the interacting systemand its environment). When the system encounters a belief---a set including allpossible hypotheses the system has for the current state---for which theobservation-based strategy is undefined, a sequence of sensing actions aretriggered, chosen by an active sensing strategy, to reduce the uncertainty inthe system's belief. We show that by alternating between the observation-basedstrategy and the active sensing strategy, under a mild technical assumption ofthe set of sensors in the system, the given temporal logic specification can besatisfied with probability 1.

DrMAD: Distilling Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation for Optimizing  Hyperparameters of Deep Neural Networks

  The performance of deep neural networks is well-known to be sensitive to thesetting of their hyperparameters. Recent advances in reverse-mode automaticdifferentiation allow for optimizing hyperparameters with gradients. Thestandard way of computing these gradients involves a forward and backward passof computations. However, the backward pass usually needs to consumeunaffordable memory to store all the intermediate variables to exactly reversethe forward training procedure. In this work we propose a simple but effectivemethod, DrMAD, to distill the knowledge of the forward pass into a shortcutpath, through which we approximately reverse the training trajectory.Experiments on several image benchmark datasets show that DrMAD is at least 45times faster and consumes 100 times less memory compared to state-of-the-artmethods for optimizing hyperparameters with minimal compromise to itseffectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, DrMAD is the first researchattempt to make it practical to automatically tune thousands of hyperparametersof deep neural networks. The code can be downloaded fromhttps://github.com/bigaidream-projects/drmad

Deep Q-Networks for Accelerating the Training of Deep Neural Networks

  In this paper, we propose a principled deep reinforcement learning (RL)approach that is able to accelerate the convergence rate of general deep neuralnetworks (DNNs). With our approach, a deep RL agent (synonym for optimizer inthis work) is used to automatically learn policies about how to schedulelearning rates during the optimization of a DNN. The state features of theagent are learned from the weight statistics of the optimizee during training.The reward function of this agent is designed to learn policies that minimizethe optimizee's training time given a certain performance goal. The actions ofthe agent correspond to changing the learning rate for the optimizee duringtraining. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to use deep RL to learnhow to optimize a large-sized DNN. We perform extensive experiments on astandard benchmark dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the policieslearned by our approach.

Role of Particle Interactions in the Feshbach Conversion of Fermion  Atoms to Bosonic Molecules

  We investigate the Feshbach conversion of fermion atomic pairs to condensedboson molecules with a microscopic model that accounts the repulsiveinteractions among all the particles involved. We find that the conversionefficiency is enhanced by the interaction between boson molecules whilesuppressed by the interactions between fermion atoms and between atom andmolecule. In certain cases, the combined effect of these interactions leads toa ceiling of less than 100% on the conversion efficiency even in the adiabaticlimit. Our model predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the efficiency on meanatomic density. Our theory agrees well with recent experiments on $^6$Li and$^{40}$K.

Many-Body Effects on Nonadiabatic Feshbach Conversion in Bosonic Systems

  We investigate the dynamics of converting cold bosonic atoms to moleculeswhen an external magnetic field is swept across a Feshbach resonance. Ouranalysis relies on a zero temperature quantum microscopic model that accountsfor many-body effects, triggering the association process. We show that thepicture of two-body molecular production depicted by Landau-Zener model issignificantly altered due to many-body effects. In nonadiabatic regime, wederive an analytic expression for molecular conversion efficiency that explainsthe discrepancy between the prediction of Landau-Zener formula and experimentaldata[Hodby et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 94}, 120402 (2005)]. Our theory isfurther extended to the formation of heteronuclear diatomic molecules and givessome interesting predictions.

Epidemic reemergence in adaptive complex networks

  The dynamic nature of system gives rise to dynamical features of epidemicspreading, such as oscillation and bistability. In this paper, by studying theepidemic spreading in growing networks, in which susceptible nodes mayadaptively break the connections with infected ones yet avoid getting isolated,we reveal a new phenomenon - \emph{epidemic reemergence}, where the number ofinfected nodes is incubated at a low level for a long time and then bursts upfor a short time. The process may repeat several times before the infectionfinally vanishes. Simulation results show that all the three factors, namelythe network growth, the connection breaking and the isolation avoidance, arenecessary for epidemic reemergence to happen. We present a simple theoreticalanalysis to explain the process of reemergence in detail. Our study may offersome useful insights helping explain the phenomenon of repeated epidemicexplosions.

Proximity-effect-induced superconductivity in topological  insulator-related material Bi2Se3

  We have studied the electron transport properties of topologicalinsulator-related material Bi2Se3 near the superconducting Pb-Bi2Se3 interface,and found that a superconducting state is induced over an extended volume inBi2Se3. This state can carry a Josephson supercurrent, and demonstrates agap-like structure in the conductance spectra as probed by a normal-metalelectrode. The establishment of the gap is not by confining the electrons intoa narrow space close to the superconductor-normal metal interface, aspreviously observed in other systems, but presumably via electron-electronattractive interaction in Bi2Se3.

Majorana fermions in a superconducting Mobius strip

  Recently, much attention has been paid to search for Majorana fermions insolid-state systems. Among various proposals there is one based onradio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices (rf-SQUIDs), inwhich the appearance of 4$\pi$-period energy-phase relations is regarded assmoking-gun evidence of Majorana fermion states. Here we report the observationof truncated 4$\pi$-period (i.e., 2$\pi$-period but fully skewed) oscillatorypatterns of contact resistance on rf-SQUIDs constructed on the surface ofthree-dimensional topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$. The results reveal theexistence of 1/2 fractional modes of Cooper pairs and the occurrence of parityswitchings, both of which are necessary signatures accompanied with theformation of Majorana fermion states.

Decoupled Potential Integral Equations for Electromagnetic Scattering  from Dielectric Objects

  Recent work on developing novel integral equation formulations has involvedusing potentials as opposed to fields. This is a consequence of the additionalflexibility offered by using potentials to develop well conditioned systems.Most of the work in this arena has wrestled with developing this formulationfor perfectly conducting objects (Vico et al., 2014 and Liu et al., 2015), withrecent effort made to addressing similar problems for dielectrics (Li et al.,2017). In this paper, we present well-conditioned decoupled potential integralequation (DPIE) formulated for electromagnetic scattering from homogeneousdielectric objects, a fully developed version of that presented in theconference communication (Li et al., 2017). The formulation is based onboundary conditions derived for decoupled boundary conditions on the scalar andvector potentials. The resulting DPIE is the second kind integral equation, anddoes not suffer from either low frequency or dense mesh breakdown. Analyticalproperties of the DPIE are studied. Results on the sphere analysis are providedto demonstrate the conditioning and spectrum of the resulting linear system.

Nonlinear Shape Regression For Filtering Segmentation Results From  Calcium Imaging

  A shape filter is presented to repair segmentation results obtained incalcium imaging of neurons in vivo. This post-segmentation algorithm canautomatically smooth the shapes obtained from a preliminary segmentation, whileprecluding the cases where two neurons are counted as one combined component.The shape filter is realized using a square-root velocity to project the shapeson a shape manifold in which distances between shapes are based on elasticchanges. Two data-driven weighting methods are proposed to achieve a trade-offbetween shape smoothness and consistency with the data. Intuitive comparisonsof proposed methods via projection onto Cartesian maps demonstrate thesmoothing ability of the shape filter. Quantitative measures also prove thesuperiority of our methods over models that do not employ any weightingcriterion.

The new mode of instability in viscous high-speed boundary layer flows

  The new mode of instability found by Tunney et al. is studied with viscousstability theory in this article. When the high-speed boundary layer is subjectto certain values of favorable pressure gradient and wall heating, a new modebecomes unstable due to the appearance of the streamwise velocity overshoot($U(y)>U_\infty$) in the base flow. The present study shows that underpractical Reynolds numbers, the new mode can hardly co-exist with conventionalfirst mode and Mack's second mode. Due to the requirement for additional wallheating, the new mode may only lead to laminar-turbulent transition underexperimental (artificial) conditions.

Dataflow-based Joint Quantization of Weights and Activations for Deep  Neural Networks

  This paper addresses a challenging problem - how to reduce energy consumptionwithout incurring performance drop when deploying deep neural networks (DNNs)at the inference stage. In order to alleviate the computation and storageburdens, we propose a novel dataflow-based joint quantization approach with thehypothesis that a fewer number of quantization operations would incur lessinformation loss and thus improve the final performance. It first introduces aquantization scheme with efficient bit-shifting and rounding operations torepresent network parameters and activations in low precision. Then itrestructures the network architectures to form unified modules for optimizationon the quantized model. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and KITTI validatethe effectiveness of our model, demonstrating that state-of-the-art results forvarious tasks can be achieved by this quantized model. Besides, we designed andsynthesized an RTL model to measure the hardware costs among variousquantization methods. For each quantization operation, it reduces area cost byabout 15 times and energy consumption by about 9 times, compared to a strongbaseline.

Evidence of Majorana Zero Modes in Josephson Trijunctions

  In search of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation (TQC), zero-biasconductance peak as a necessary signature of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) hasbeen observed in a number of solid-state systems. Here, we present thesignature of MZMs from a phase-sensitive experiment on Josephson trijunctionsconstructed on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators. Weobserved that the minigap at the center of the trijunction is protected toclose over extended regions in phase space, supporting in principle theMajorana phase diagram proposed by Fu and Kane in 2008. Our study paves the wayfor further braiding MZMs and exploring TQC on a scalable two-dimensionalplatform.

Periodic Modulation Effect on Self-Trapping of Two weakly coupled  Bose-Einstein Condensates

  With phase space analysis approach, we investigate thoroughly theself-trapping phenomenon for two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC)in a symmetric double-well potential. We identify two kinds of self-trapping bytheir different relative phase behavior. With applying a periodic modulation onthe energy bias of the system we find the occurrence of the self-trapping canbe controlled, saying, the transition parameters can be adjusted effectively bythe periodic modulation. Analytic expressions for the dependence of thetransition parameters on the modulation parameters are derived for high and lowfrequency modulations. For an intermediate frequency modulation, we find theresonance between the periodic modulation and nonlinear Rabi oscillationdramatically affects the tunnelling dynamics and demonstrate many novelphenomena. Finally, we study the effects of many-body quantum fluctuation onself-trapping and discuss the possible experimental realization of the model.

Quantum Entanglement Manifestation of Transition to Nonlinear  Self-trapping for Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Symmetric Double-Well

  We investigate the nonlinear self-trapping phenomenon of the Bose-Einsteincondensates (BEC) in a symmetric double-well, emphasizing on its behinddynamical phase transition. With increasing the nonlinear parameter depictingthe interaction between the degenerate atoms the BEC turns to be self-trappedmanifesting an asymmetric distribution of the atomic density profile. Essenceof this phenomenon is revealed to be a continuous phase transition andunderlying critical behavior is studied analytically and found to follow alogarithm scaling-law. We then go beyond the mean field treatment and extend todiscuss the effect of the many-body quantum fluctuation on the transition. Itis found that the transition point is shifted and the scaling-law is broken. Inparticular, the quantum phase transition is accompanied by the change of theentanglement entropy which is found to reach maximum at transition point.Behind physics is revealed.

Quantum $\frak {gl}_\infty$, infinite $q$-Schur algebras and their  representations

  In this paper, we investigate the structure and representations of thequantum group ${\mathbf{U}(\infty)}=\mathbf U_\upsilon(\frak{gl}_\infty)$. Wewill present a realization for $\mathbf{U}(\infty)$, followingBeilinson--Lusztig--MacPherson (BLM) \cite{BLM}, and show that the naturalalgebra homomorphism $\zeta_r$ from $\mathbf{U}(\infty)$ to the infinite$q$-Schur algebra ${\boldsymbol{\mathcal S}}(\infty,r)$ is not surjective forany $r\geq 1$. We will give a BLM type realization for the image$\mathbf{U}(\infty,r):=\zeta_r(\mathbf{U}(\infty))$ and discuss itspresentation in terms of generators and relations. We further construct acertain completion algebra $\hat{\boldsymbol{\mathcal K}}^\dagger(\infty)$ sothat $\zeta_r$ can be extended to an algebra epimorphism$\tilde\zeta_r:\hat{\boldsymbol{\mathcalK}}^\dagger(\infty)\to{\boldsymbol{\mathcal S}}(\infty,r)$. Finally we willinvestigate the representation theory of ${\bf U}(\infty)$, especially thepolynomial representations of ${\bf U}(\infty)$.

Adiabatic Fidelity for Atom-Molecule Conversion in a Nonlinear  Three-Level Λ-system

  We investigate the dynamics of the population transfer for atom-moleculethree-level $\Lambda$-system on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage(STIRAP). Wefind that the adiabatic fidelity for the coherent population trapping(CPT)state or dark state, as the function of the adiabatic parameter, approaches tounit in a power law. The power exponent however is much less than theprediction of linear adiabatic theorem. We further discuss how to achievehigher adiabatic fidelity for the dark state through optimizing the externalparameters of STIRAP. Our discussions are helpful to gain higher atom-moleculeconversion yield in practical experiments.

Rosen-Zener interferometry with Ultracold Atoms

  We propose a time-domain "interferometer" based on ultracold Bose atomsloaded on a double well potential. By the adiabatic Rosen-Zener process, thebarrier between two wells is ramped down slowly, held for a while, then rampedback. Starting with a coherent state of double well system, the finaloccupations on one well show interesting interference fringes in thetime-domain. The fringe pattern is sensitive to the initial state, theinteratomic interaction, and the external forces such as gravity which canchange the shape of the double well. In this sense, this interferometric schemehas the potentials for precision measurements with ultracold atoms. Theunderlying mechanism is revealed and possible applications are discussed.

Pressure of Degenerate and Relativistic electrons in a superhigh  magnetic field

  Based on our previous work, we deduce a general formula for pressure ofdegenerate and relativistic electrons,Pe, which is suitable for superhighmagnetic fields, discuss the quantization of Landau levels of electrons, andconsider the quantum electrodynam-ic(QED) effects on the equations of states(EOSs) for different matter systems. The main conclusions are as follows:Pe isrelated to the magnetic field B, matter density ?, and electron fraction Ye ;the stronger the magnetic field, the higher the electron pressure becomes; thehigh electron pressure could be caused by high Fermi energy of electrons in asuperhigh magnetic field; compared with a common radio pulsar, a magnetar couldbe a more compact oblate spheroid-like deformed neutron star due to theanisotropic total pressure; and an increase in the maximum mass of a magnetaris expected because of the positive contribution of the magnetic field energyto the EOS of the star.

Learning Low-Complexity Autoregressive Models via Proximal Alternating  Minimization

  We consider the estimation of the state transition matrix in vectorautoregressive models, when time sequence data is limited but nonsequencesteady-state data is abundant. To leverage both sources of data, we formulatethe least squares minimization problem regularized by a Lyapunov penalty. Weimpose cardinality or rank constraints to reduce the complexity of theautoregressive model. We solve the resulting nonconvex, nonsmooth problem byusing the proximal alternating linearization method (PALM). We show that PALMis globally convergent to a critical point and that the estimation errormonotonically decreases. Furthermore, we obtain explicit formulas for theproximal operators to facilitate the implementation of PALM. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of the developed method on synthetic and real-world data. Ourexperiments show that PALM outperforms the gradient projection method in bothcomputational efficiency and solution quality.

Generalized Debye Sources Based EFIE Solver on Subdivision Surfaces

  The electric field integral equation is a well known workhorse for obtainingfields scattered by a perfect electric conducting (PEC) object. As a result,the nuances and challenges of solving this equation have been examined for awhile. Two recent papers motivate the effort presented in this paper. Unliketraditional work that uses equivalent currents defined on surfaces, recentresearch proposes a technique that results in well conditioned systems byemploying generalized Debye sources (GDS) as unknowns. In a complementaryeffort, some of us developed a method that exploits the same representation forboth the geometry (subdivision surface representations) and functions definedon the geometry, also known as isogeometric analysis (IGA). The challenge ingeneralizing GDS method to a discretized geometry is the complexity of theintermediate operators. However, thanks to our earlier work on subdivisionsurfaces, the additional smoothness of geometric representation permitsdiscretizing these intermediate operations. In this paper, we employ both ideasto present a well conditioned GDS-EFIE. Here, the intermediate surfaceLaplacian is well discretized by using subdivision basis. Likewise, usingsubdivision basis to represent the sources, results in an efficient andaccurate IGA framework. Numerous results are presented to demonstrate theefficacy of the approach.

Constructions of Optimal Cyclic $(r,δ)$ Locally Repairable Codes

  A code is said to be a $r$-local locally repairable code (LRC) if each of itscoordinates can be repaired by accessing at most $r$ other coordinates. Whensome of the $r$ coordinates are also erased, the $r$-local LRC can notaccomplish the local repair, which leads to the concept of$(r,\delta)$-locality. A $q$-ary $[n, k]$ linear code $\cC$ is said to have$(r, \delta)$-locality ($\delta\ge 2$) if for each coordinate $i$, there existsa punctured subcode of $\cC$ with support containing $i$, whose length is atmost $r + \delta - 1$, and whose minimum distance is at least $\delta$. The$(r, \delta)$-LRC can tolerate $\delta-1$ erasures in total, which degeneratesto a $r$-local LRC when $\delta=2$. A $q$-ary $(r,\delta)$ LRC is calledoptimal if it meets the Singleton-like bound for $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. A class ofoptimal $q$-ary cyclic $r$-local LRCs with lengths $n\mid q-1$ were constructedby Tamo, Barg, Goparaju and Calderbank based on the $q$-ary Reed-Solomon codes.In this paper, we construct a class of optimal $q$-ary cyclic $(r,\delta)$-LRCs($\delta\ge 2$) with length $n\mid q-1$, which generalizes the results of Tamo\emph{et al.} Moreover, we construct a new class of optimal $q$-ary cyclic$r$-local LRCs with lengths $n\mid q+1$ and a new class of optimal $q$-arycyclic $(r,\delta)$-LRCs ($\delta\ge 2$) with lengths $n\mid q+1$. Theconstructed optimal LRCs with length $n=q+1$ have the best-known length $q+1$for the given finite field with size $q$ when the minimum distance is largerthan $4$.

On the Weight Hierarchy of Locally Repairable Codes

  An $(n,k,r)$ \emph{locally repairable code} (LRC) is an $[n,k,d]$ linear codewhere every code symbol can be repaired from at most $r$ other code symbols. AnLRC is said to be optimal if the minimum distance attains the Singleton-likebound $d \le n-k-\lceil k/r \rceil +2$. The \emph{generalized Hamming weights}(GHWs) of linear codes are fundamental parameters which have many usefulapplications. Generally it is difficult to determine the GHWs of linear codes.In this paper, we study the GHWs of LRCs. Firstly, we obtain a generalizedSingleton-like bound on the $i$-th $(1\le i \le k)$ GHWs of general $(n,k,r)$LRCs. Then, it is shown that for an optimal $(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \mid k$, itsweight hierarchy can be completely determined, and the $i$-th GHW of an optimal$(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \mid k$ attains the proposed generalized Singleton-likebound for all $1\le i \le k$. For an optimal $(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \nmid k$, wegive lower bounds on the GHWs of the LRC and its dual code. Finally, twogeneral bounds on linear codes in terms of the GHWs are presented. Moreover, itis also shown that some previous results on the bounds of minimum distances oflinear codes can also be explained or refined in terms of the GHWs.

New ZZ Ceti stars from the LAMOST survey

  The spectroscopic sky survey carried out by the Large Sky Area Multi-ObjectFiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) provides the largest stellar spectralibrary in the world until now. A large number of new DA white dwarfs had beenidentified based on the LAMOST spectra. The effective temperature ($T_{\rmeff}$) and surface gravity ($\log g$) of most DA white dwarfs were determinedand published in the catalogs, e.g. Zhao et al. (2013), Rebassa-Mansergas etal. (2015), Gentile Fusillo et al. (2015) and Guo et al. (2015). We selected ZZCeti candidates from the published catalogs by considering whether their$T_{\rm eff}$ are situated in the ZZ Ceti instability strip. The follow-uptime-series photometric observations for the candidates were performed in 2015and 2016. Four stars: LAMOST J004628.31+343319.90, LAMOST J062159.49+252335.9,LAMOST J010302.46+433756.2 and LAMOST J013033.90+273757.9 are finally confirmedto be new ZZ Ceti stars. They show dominant peaks with amplitudes rising abovethe 99.9% confidence level in the amplitude spectra. As LAMOSTJ004628.31+343319.90 has an estimated mass of $\sim$ 0.40 $M_{\odot}$ andLAMOST J013033.90+273757.9 has a mass of $\sim$ 0.45 $M_{\odot}$ derived fromtheir $\log g$ values, these two stars are inferred to be potential helium-corewhite dwarfs.
