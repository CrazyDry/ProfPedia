Bilingual Dictionary Induction for Bantu Languages

  We present a method for learning bilingual translation dictionaries betweenEnglish and Bantu languages. We show that exploiting the grammatical structurecommon to Bantu languages enables bilingual dictionary induction for languageswhere training data is unavailable.

Characterizing Departures from Linearity in Word Translation

  We investigate the behavior of maps learned by machine translation methods.The maps translate words by projecting between word embedding spaces ofdifferent languages. We locally approximate these maps using linear maps, andfind that they vary across the word embedding space. This demonstrates that theunderlying maps are non-linear. Importantly, we show that the locally linearmaps vary by an amount that is tightly correlated with the distance between theneighborhoods on which they are trained. Our results can be used to testnon-linear methods, and to drive the design of more accurate maps for wordtranslation.

Bootstrapping Ternary Relation Extractors

  Binary relation extraction methods have been widely studied in recent years.However, few methods have been developed for higher n-ary relation extraction.One limiting factor is the effort required to generate training data. Forbinary relations, one only has to provide a few dozen pairs of entities perrelation, as training data. For ternary relations (n=3), each training instanceis a triplet of entities, placing a greater cognitive load on people. Forexample, many people know that Google acquired Youtube but not the dollaramount or the date of the acquisition and many people know that Hillary Clintonis married to Bill Clinton by not the location or date of their wedding. Thismakes higher n-nary training data generation a time consuming exercise insearching the Web. We present a resource for training ternary relationextractors. This was generated using a minimally supervised yet effectiveapproach. We present statistics on the size and the quality of the dataset.

Machine Reading with Background Knowledge

  Intelligent systems capable of automatically understanding natural languagetext are important for many artificial intelligence applications includingmobile phone voice assistants, computer vision, and robotics. Understandinglanguage often constitutes fitting new information into a previously acquiredview of the world. However, many machine reading systems rely on the text aloneto infer its meaning. In this paper, we pursue a different approach; machinereading methods that make use of background knowledge to facilitate languageunderstanding. To this end, we have developed two methods: The first methodaddresses prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. It uses backgroundknowledge within a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that learns fromboth labeled and unlabeled data. This approach yields state-of-the-art resultson two datasets against strong baselines; The second method extractsrelationships from compound nouns. Our knowledge-aware method for compound nounanalysis accurately extracts relationships and significantly outperforms abaseline that does not make use of background knowledge.

An Operator for Entity Extraction in MapReduce

  Dictionary-based entity extraction involves finding mentions of dictionaryentities in text. Text mentions are often noisy, containing spurious or missingwords. Efficient algorithms for detecting approximate entity mentions followone of two general techniques. The first approach is to build an index on theentities and perform index lookups of document substrings. The second approachrecognizes that the number of substrings generated from documents can explodeto large numbers, to get around this, they use a filter to prune many suchsubstrings which do not match any dictionary entity and then only verify theremaining substrings if they are entity mentions of dictionary entities, bymeans of a text join. The choice between the index-based approach and thefilter & verification-based approach is a case-to-case decision as the bestapproach depends on the characteristics of the input entity dictionary, forexample frequency of entity mentions. Choosing the right approach for thesetting can make a substantial difference in execution time. Making this choiceis however non-trivial as there are parameters within each of the approachesthat make the space of possible approaches very large. In this paper, wepresent a cost-based operator for making the choice among execution plans forentity extraction. Since we need to deal with large dictionaries and evenlarger large datasets, our operator is developed for implementations ofMapReduce distributed algorithms.

Discovering Sound Concepts and Acoustic Relations In Text

  In this paper we describe approaches for discovering acoustic concepts andrelations in text. The first major goal is to be able to identify text phraseswhich contain a notion of audibility and can be termed as a sound or anacoustic concept. We also propose a method to define an acoustic scene througha set of sound concepts. We use pattern matching and parts of speech tags togenerate sound concepts from large scale text corpora. We use dependencyparsing and LSTM recurrent neural network to predict a set of sound conceptsfor a given acoustic scene. These methods are not only helpful in creating anacoustic knowledge base but in the future can also directly help acoustic eventand scene detection research.
