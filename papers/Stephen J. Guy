Universal power law governing pedestrian interactions

  Human crowds often bear a striking resemblance to interacting particle
systems, and this has prompted many researchers to describe pedestrian dynamics
in terms of interaction forces and potential energies. The correct quantitative
form of this interaction, however, has remained an open question. Here, we
introduce a novel statistical-mechanical approach to directly measure the
interaction energy between pedestrians. This analysis, when applied to a large
collection of human motion data, reveals a simple power law interaction that is
based not on the physical separation between pedestrians but on their projected
time to a potential future collision, and is therefore fundamentally
anticipatory in nature. Remarkably, this simple law is able to describe human
interactions across a wide variety of situations, speeds and densities. We
further show, through simulations, that the interaction law we identify is
sufficient to reproduce many known crowd phenomena.


Augur: a Modeling Language for Data-Parallel Probabilistic Inference

  It is time-consuming and error-prone to implement inference procedures for
each new probabilistic model. Probabilistic programming addresses this problem
by allowing a user to specify the model and having a compiler automatically
generate an inference procedure for it. For this approach to be practical, it
is important to generate inference code that has reasonable performance. In
this paper, we present a probabilistic programming language and compiler for
Bayesian networks designed to make effective use of data-parallel architectures
such as GPUs. Our language is fully integrated within the Scala programming
language and benefits from tools such as IDE support, type-checking, and code
completion. We show that the compiler can generate data-parallel inference code
scalable to thousands of GPU cores by making use of the conditional
independence relationships in the Bayesian network.


ALAN: Adaptive Learning for Multi-Agent Navigation

  In multi-agent navigation, agents need to move towards their goal locations
while avoiding collisions with other agents and static obstacles, often without
communication with each other. Existing methods compute motions that are
optimal locally but do not account for the aggregated motions of all agents,
producing inefficient global behavior especially when agents move in a crowded
space. In this work, we develop methods to allow agents to dynamically adapt
their behavior to their local conditions. We accomplish this by formulating the
multi-agent navigation problem as an action-selection problem, and propose an
approach, ALAN, that allows agents to compute time-efficient and collision-free
motions. ALAN is highly scalable because each agent makes its own decisions on
how to move using a set of velocities optimized for a variety of navigation
tasks. Experimental results show that the agents using ALAN, in general, reach
their destinations faster than using ORCA, a state-of-the-art collision
avoidance framework, the Social Forces model for pedestrian navigation, and a
Predictive collision avoidance model.


PICsIM - the INTEGRAL/IBIS/PICsIT Observation Simulation Tool for
  Prototype Software Evaluation

  The INTEGRAL satellite is an observatory-class gamma-ray telescope due for
launch in early 2002. It comprises two main instruments, one optimised for
imaging (IBIS) and the other for spectroscopy (SPI). The PICsIT telescope is
the high energy (150 keV - 10 MeV) plane of the IBIS imager and consists of 8
individual modules of 512 detection elements. The modules are arranged in a 4 x
2 pattern, while the pixels are in a 16 x 32 array. This layout, which includes
a dead area equivalent to one pixel width between each module, together with
the event selection procedure, which (in standard mode) does not allow the
identification of coincidences between separate modules, leads to a
non-uniformity of the background which is significantly different for
single-site events and for multiple energy deposits. Other sources of
background variations range from the separate low energy detector, situated
immediately above the PICsIT plane, to the large mass of the SPI telescope at a
short distance to one side. The algorithms for performing all the imaging and
spectral deconvolution for PICsIT are currently being produced for delivery to
the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre. In order to maximise the information which
may be extracted from the PICsIT data, we have designed a prototyping
environment which consists of a GUI to a highly structured and modular set of
procedures which allows the easy simulation of observations from the data
collection phase through to the final image production and analysis.


Taking the Measure of the Universe: Precision Astrometry with SIM
  PlanetQuest

  Precision astrometry at microarcsecond accuracy has application to a wide
range of astrophysical problems. This paper is a study of the science questions
that can be addressed using an instrument that delivers parallaxes at about 4
microarcsec on targets as faint as V = 20, differential accuracy of 0.6
microarcsec on bright targets, and with flexible scheduling. The science topics
are drawn primarily from the Team Key Projects, selected in 2000, for the Space
Interferometry Mission PlanetQuest (SIM PlanetQuest). We use the capabilities
of this mission to illustrate the importance of the next level of astrometric
precision in modern astrophysics. SIM PlanetQuest is currently in the detailed
design phase, having completed all of the enabling technologies needed for the
flight instrument in 2005. It will be the first space-based long baseline
Michelson interferometer designed for precision astrometry. SIM will contribute
strongly to many astronomical fields including stellar and galactic
astrophysics, planetary systems around nearby stars, and the study of quasar
and AGN nuclei. SIM will search for planets with masses as small as an Earth
orbiting in the `habitable zone' around the nearest stars using differential
astrometry, and could discover many dozen if Earth-like planets are common. It
will be the most capable instrument for detecting planets around young stars,
thereby providing insights into how planetary systems are born and how they
evolve with time. SIM will observe significant numbers of very high- and
low-mass stars, providing stellar masses to 1%, the accuracy needed to
challenge physical models. Using precision proper motion measurements, SIM will
probe the galactic mass distribution and the formation and evolution of the
Galactic halo. (abridged)


An edge-on translucent dust disk around the nearest AGB star L2 Puppis -
  VLT/NACO spectro-imaging from 1.04 to 4.05 microns and VLTI interferometry

  As the nearest known AGB star (d=64pc) and one of the brightest (mK-2), L2
Pup is a particularly interesting benchmark object to monitor the final stages
of stellar evolution. We report new lucky imaging observations of this star
with the VLT/NACO adaptive optics system in twelve narrow band filters covering
the 1.0-4.0 microns wavelength range. These diffraction limited images reveal
an extended circumstellar dust lane in front of the star, that exhibits a high
opacity in the J band and becomes translucent in the H and K bands. In the L
band, extended thermal emission from the dust is detected. We reproduce these
observations using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer modeling of a dust disk with
the RADMC-3D code. We also present new interferometric observations with the
VLTI/VINCI and MIDI instruments. We measure in the K band an upper limit to the
limb-darkened angular diameter of theta_LD = 17.9 +/- 1.6 mas, converting to a
maximum linear radius of R = 123 +/- 14 Rsun. Considering the geometry of the
extended K band emission in the NACO images, this upper limit is probably close
to the actual angular diameter of the star. The position of L2 Pup in the
Herzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that this star has a mass around 2 Msun
and is probably experiencing an early stage of the asymptotic giant branch. We
do not detect any stellar companion of L2 Pup in our adaptive optics and
interferometric observations, and we attribute its apparent astrometric wobble
in the Hipparcos data to variable lighting effects on its circumstellar
material. We however do not exclude the presence of a binary companion, as the
large loop structure extending to more than 10 AU to the North-East of the disk
in our L band images may be the result of interaction between the stellar wind
of L2 Pup and a hidden secondary object. The geometric configuration that we
propose, with a large dust disk seen almost edge-on, appears particularly
favorable to test and develop our understanding of the formation of bipolar
nebulae.


Measurement of BAO correlations at $z=2.3$ with SDSS DR12 \lya-Forests

  We use flux-transmission correlations in \Lya forests to measure the imprint
of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The study uses spectra of 157,783
quasars in the redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). Besides the statistical improvements on
our previous studies using SDSS DR9 and DR11, we have implemented numerous
improvements in the analysis procedure, allowing us to construct a physical
model of the correlation function and to investigate potential systematic
errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. The Hubble distance,
$\DHub=c/H(z)$, relative to the sound horizon is $\DHub(z=2.33)/r_d=9.07 \pm
0.31$. The best-determined combination of comoving angular-diameter distance,
$\DM$, and the Hubble distance is found to be
$\DHub^{0.7}\DM^{0.3}/r_d=13.94\pm0.35$. This value is $1.028\pm0.026$ times
the prediction of the flat-\lcdm model consistent with the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum. The errors include marginalization over
the effects of unidentified high-density absorption systems and fluctuations in
ultraviolet ionizing radiation. Independently of the CMB measurements, the
combination of our results and other BAO observations determine the open-\lcdm
density parameters to be $\om=0.296 \pm 0.029$, $\ol=0.699 \pm 0.100$ and
$\Omega_k = -0.002 \pm 0.119$.


Cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
  measurements

  We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy
models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements
with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We take
advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the
Ly-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield a
high confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMB
angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAO
and SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of
$H_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombination
physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,
so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is an
important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, our
BAO+SN+CMB combination yields $\Omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature
$\Omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark
energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM.
While the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO
measurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.
Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high
redshifts remain consistent with our constraints. Expansion history alone
yields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species,
improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energy
models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is
high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)


The DESI Experiment Part I: Science,Targeting, and Survey Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark
energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the
growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy
and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution,
spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We
will measure luminous red galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out to
even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up
to $z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying
dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 < z < 3.5$), for the
Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to
trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient
observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a
magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million
galaxies with a median $z\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy
and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine
the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.


The DESI Experiment Part II: Instrument Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectropic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark
energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations and the growth
of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and
quasar redshift survey. The DESI instrument is a robotically-actuated,
fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking up to 5,000 simultaneous spectra over
a wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The fibers feed ten three-arm
spectrographs with resolution $R= \lambda/\Delta\lambda$ between 2000 and 5500,
depending on wavelength. The DESI instrument will be used to conduct a
five-year survey designed to cover 14,000 deg$^2$. This powerful instrument
will be installed at prime focus on the 4-m Mayall telescope in Kitt Peak,
Arizona, along with a new optical corrector, which will provide a three-degree
diameter field of view. The DESI collaboration will also deliver a
spectroscopic pipeline and data management system to reduce and archive all
data for eventual public use.


LSST: from Science Drivers to Reference Design and Anticipated Data
  Products

  (Abridged) We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in
the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array of
science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will
have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is
driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking
an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and
mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at
Cerro Pach\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m
effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel
camera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second
exposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given
night. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000
square degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\sigma$
point-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\sim 24.5$ (AB). The
project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations
by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with
$\delta<+34.5^\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,
covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\% of the observing time
will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a
18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the
anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\sim27.5$. The
remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a
Very Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products,
including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion
objects, available to the public and scientists around the world.


The SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Overview
  and Early Data

  The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct
novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point
Observatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain
Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the
Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for
studies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the
distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Using more
than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median
redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of $d_A(z)$ to
an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1% when combined with the
z>0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ~195,000 new emission line galaxy
redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 3.1% and
H(z) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000
spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance
measurements over the redshift range 0.9<z<2.2, with expected precision of 2.8%
and 4.2% on $d_A(z)$ and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars
and re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new
Lyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z>2.1; these new data will enhance
the precision of $d_A(z)$ and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS.
Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on
cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved
tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints
on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the
cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral
quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.


Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV: Mapping the Milky Way, Nearby Galaxies, and
  the Distant Universe

  We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing
three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky
Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in the
near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)
survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby
galaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas
distributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using
baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the
power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the
SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray
AGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meter
Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations there
began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared
spectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,
with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are
scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy,
SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data
Release 13, was made available in July 2016.


The Fourteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First
  Spectroscopic Data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
  and from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
  Experiment

  The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in
operation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release from
this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data Release
Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its first
two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14
is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all
data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14
is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the
Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2),
including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine
learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes
from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous
release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of
the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the
important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both
targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS
website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to
data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is
planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be
followed by SDSS-V.


The Thirteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First
  Spectroscopic Data from the SDSS-IV Survey MApping Nearby Galaxies at Apache
  Point Observatory

  The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began
observations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, and
eBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS.
This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13
(DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all
SDSS data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makes
publicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of
nearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It
includes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to
targeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected
objects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new
reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric
calibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the
APOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously
included and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For
the SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric
calibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem with
DR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and
an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location and
format of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references to
the important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data
reduction. The SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data,
tutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the
reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that
will contain new data and analyses from the planned ~6-year operations of
SDSS-IV.
