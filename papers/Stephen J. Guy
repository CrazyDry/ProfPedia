Augur: a Modeling Language for Data-Parallel Probabilistic Inference

  It is time-consuming and error-prone to implement inference procedures foreach new probabilistic model. Probabilistic programming addresses this problemby allowing a user to specify the model and having a compiler automaticallygenerate an inference procedure for it. For this approach to be practical, itis important to generate inference code that has reasonable performance. Inthis paper, we present a probabilistic programming language and compiler forBayesian networks designed to make effective use of data-parallel architecturessuch as GPUs. Our language is fully integrated within the Scala programminglanguage and benefits from tools such as IDE support, type-checking, and codecompletion. We show that the compiler can generate data-parallel inference codescalable to thousands of GPU cores by making use of the conditionalindependence relationships in the Bayesian network.

Universal power law governing pedestrian interactions

  Human crowds often bear a striking resemblance to interacting particlesystems, and this has prompted many researchers to describe pedestrian dynamicsin terms of interaction forces and potential energies. The correct quantitativeform of this interaction, however, has remained an open question. Here, weintroduce a novel statistical-mechanical approach to directly measure theinteraction energy between pedestrians. This analysis, when applied to a largecollection of human motion data, reveals a simple power law interaction that isbased not on the physical separation between pedestrians but on their projectedtime to a potential future collision, and is therefore fundamentallyanticipatory in nature. Remarkably, this simple law is able to describe humaninteractions across a wide variety of situations, speeds and densities. Wefurther show, through simulations, that the interaction law we identify issufficient to reproduce many known crowd phenomena.

ALAN: Adaptive Learning for Multi-Agent Navigation

  In multi-agent navigation, agents need to move towards their goal locationswhile avoiding collisions with other agents and static obstacles, often withoutcommunication with each other. Existing methods compute motions that areoptimal locally but do not account for the aggregated motions of all agents,producing inefficient global behavior especially when agents move in a crowdedspace. In this work, we develop methods to allow agents to dynamically adapttheir behavior to their local conditions. We accomplish this by formulating themulti-agent navigation problem as an action-selection problem, and propose anapproach, ALAN, that allows agents to compute time-efficient and collision-freemotions. ALAN is highly scalable because each agent makes its own decisions onhow to move using a set of velocities optimized for a variety of navigationtasks. Experimental results show that the agents using ALAN, in general, reachtheir destinations faster than using ORCA, a state-of-the-art collisionavoidance framework, the Social Forces model for pedestrian navigation, and aPredictive collision avoidance model.

PICsIM - the INTEGRAL/IBIS/PICsIT Observation Simulation Tool for  Prototype Software Evaluation

  The INTEGRAL satellite is an observatory-class gamma-ray telescope due forlaunch in early 2002. It comprises two main instruments, one optimised forimaging (IBIS) and the other for spectroscopy (SPI). The PICsIT telescope isthe high energy (150 keV - 10 MeV) plane of the IBIS imager and consists of 8individual modules of 512 detection elements. The modules are arranged in a 4 x2 pattern, while the pixels are in a 16 x 32 array. This layout, which includesa dead area equivalent to one pixel width between each module, together withthe event selection procedure, which (in standard mode) does not allow theidentification of coincidences between separate modules, leads to anon-uniformity of the background which is significantly different forsingle-site events and for multiple energy deposits. Other sources ofbackground variations range from the separate low energy detector, situatedimmediately above the PICsIT plane, to the large mass of the SPI telescope at ashort distance to one side. The algorithms for performing all the imaging andspectral deconvolution for PICsIT are currently being produced for delivery tothe INTEGRAL Science Data Centre. In order to maximise the information whichmay be extracted from the PICsIT data, we have designed a prototypingenvironment which consists of a GUI to a highly structured and modular set ofprocedures which allows the easy simulation of observations from the datacollection phase through to the final image production and analysis.

Taking the Measure of the Universe: Precision Astrometry with SIM  PlanetQuest

  Precision astrometry at microarcsecond accuracy has application to a widerange of astrophysical problems. This paper is a study of the science questionsthat can be addressed using an instrument that delivers parallaxes at about 4microarcsec on targets as faint as V = 20, differential accuracy of 0.6microarcsec on bright targets, and with flexible scheduling. The science topicsare drawn primarily from the Team Key Projects, selected in 2000, for the SpaceInterferometry Mission PlanetQuest (SIM PlanetQuest). We use the capabilitiesof this mission to illustrate the importance of the next level of astrometricprecision in modern astrophysics. SIM PlanetQuest is currently in the detaileddesign phase, having completed all of the enabling technologies needed for theflight instrument in 2005. It will be the first space-based long baselineMichelson interferometer designed for precision astrometry. SIM will contributestrongly to many astronomical fields including stellar and galacticastrophysics, planetary systems around nearby stars, and the study of quasarand AGN nuclei. SIM will search for planets with masses as small as an Earthorbiting in the `habitable zone' around the nearest stars using differentialastrometry, and could discover many dozen if Earth-like planets are common. Itwill be the most capable instrument for detecting planets around young stars,thereby providing insights into how planetary systems are born and how theyevolve with time. SIM will observe significant numbers of very high- andlow-mass stars, providing stellar masses to 1%, the accuracy needed tochallenge physical models. Using precision proper motion measurements, SIM willprobe the galactic mass distribution and the formation and evolution of theGalactic halo. (abridged)

An edge-on translucent dust disk around the nearest AGB star L2 Puppis -  VLT/NACO spectro-imaging from 1.04 to 4.05 microns and VLTI interferometry

  As the nearest known AGB star (d=64pc) and one of the brightest (mK-2), L2Pup is a particularly interesting benchmark object to monitor the final stagesof stellar evolution. We report new lucky imaging observations of this starwith the VLT/NACO adaptive optics system in twelve narrow band filters coveringthe 1.0-4.0 microns wavelength range. These diffraction limited images revealan extended circumstellar dust lane in front of the star, that exhibits a highopacity in the J band and becomes translucent in the H and K bands. In the Lband, extended thermal emission from the dust is detected. We reproduce theseobservations using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer modeling of a dust disk withthe RADMC-3D code. We also present new interferometric observations with theVLTI/VINCI and MIDI instruments. We measure in the K band an upper limit to thelimb-darkened angular diameter of theta_LD = 17.9 +/- 1.6 mas, converting to amaximum linear radius of R = 123 +/- 14 Rsun. Considering the geometry of theextended K band emission in the NACO images, this upper limit is probably closeto the actual angular diameter of the star. The position of L2 Pup in theHerzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that this star has a mass around 2 Msunand is probably experiencing an early stage of the asymptotic giant branch. Wedo not detect any stellar companion of L2 Pup in our adaptive optics andinterferometric observations, and we attribute its apparent astrometric wobblein the Hipparcos data to variable lighting effects on its circumstellarmaterial. We however do not exclude the presence of a binary companion, as thelarge loop structure extending to more than 10 AU to the North-East of the diskin our L band images may be the result of interaction between the stellar windof L2 Pup and a hidden secondary object. The geometric configuration that wepropose, with a large dust disk seen almost edge-on, appears particularlyfavorable to test and develop our understanding of the formation of bipolarnebulae.

Measurement of BAO correlations at $z=2.3$ with SDSS DR12 \lya-Forests

  We use flux-transmission correlations in \Lya forests to measure the imprintof baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The study uses spectra of 157,783quasars in the redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the Sloan Digital SkySurvey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). Besides the statistical improvements onour previous studies using SDSS DR9 and DR11, we have implemented numerousimprovements in the analysis procedure, allowing us to construct a physicalmodel of the correlation function and to investigate potential systematicerrors in the determination of the BAO peak position. The Hubble distance,$\DHub=c/H(z)$, relative to the sound horizon is $\DHub(z=2.33)/r_d=9.07 \pm0.31$. The best-determined combination of comoving angular-diameter distance,$\DM$, and the Hubble distance is found to be$\DHub^{0.7}\DM^{0.3}/r_d=13.94\pm0.35$. This value is $1.028\pm0.026$ timesthe prediction of the flat-\lcdm model consistent with the cosmic microwavebackground (CMB) anisotropy spectrum. The errors include marginalization overthe effects of unidentified high-density absorption systems and fluctuations inultraviolet ionizing radiation. Independently of the CMB measurements, thecombination of our results and other BAO observations determine the open-\lcdmdensity parameters to be $\om=0.296 \pm 0.029$, $\ol=0.699 \pm 0.100$ and$\Omega_k = -0.002 \pm 0.119$.

Cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)  measurements

  We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We takeadvantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and theLy-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMBangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAOand SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$H_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, ourBAO+SN+CMB combination yields $\Omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\Omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. When we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM.While the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAOmeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. Expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)

The DESI Experiment Part I: Science,Targeting, and Survey Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based darkenergy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and thegrowth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxyand quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution,spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. Wewill measure luminous red galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out toeven higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies upto $z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlyingdark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 < z < 3.5$), for theLy-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used totrace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficientobservations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct amagnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 milliongalaxies with a median $z\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxyand quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determinethe matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.

The DESI Experiment Part II: Instrument Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectropic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based darkenergy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations and the growthof structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy andquasar redshift survey. The DESI instrument is a robotically-actuated,fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking up to 5,000 simultaneous spectra overa wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The fibers feed ten three-armspectrographs with resolution $R= \lambda/\Delta\lambda$ between 2000 and 5500,depending on wavelength. The DESI instrument will be used to conduct afive-year survey designed to cover 14,000 deg$^2$. This powerful instrumentwill be installed at prime focus on the 4-m Mayall telescope in Kitt Peak,Arizona, along with a new optical corrector, which will provide a three-degreediameter field of view. The DESI collaboration will also deliver aspectroscopic pipeline and data management system to reduce and archive alldata for eventual public use.

LSST: from Science Drivers to Reference Design and Anticipated Data  Products

  (Abridged) We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned inthe optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array ofscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST willhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design isdriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, takingan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, andmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited atCerro Pach\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 meffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixelcamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-secondexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a givennight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000square degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\sigma$point-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\sim 24.5$ (AB). Theproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operationsby 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with$\delta<+34.5^\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\% of the observing timewill be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during theanticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\sim27.5$. Theremaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as aVery Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products,including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billionobjects, available to the public and scientists around the world.

The SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Overview  and Early Data

  The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conductnovel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache PointObservatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time DomainSpectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and theSpectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed forstudies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure thedistance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Using morethan 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a medianredshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of $d_A(z)$ toan accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1% when combined with thez>0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ~195,000 new emission line galaxyredshifts, we expect BAO measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 3.1% andH(z) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distancemeasurements over the redshift range 0.9<z<2.2, with expected precision of 2.8%and 4.2% on $d_A(z)$ and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasarsand re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain newLyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z>2.1; these new data will enhancethe precision of $d_A(z)$ and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS.Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity oncosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improvedtests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraintson the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of thecosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectralquality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV: Mapping the Milky Way, Nearby Galaxies, and  the Distant Universe

  We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassingthree major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory GalacticEvolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of MilkyWay stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in thenear-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearbygalaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon OscillationSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gasdistributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology usingbaryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of thepower spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: theSPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-rayAGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meterSloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations therebegan in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infraredspectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities arescheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy,SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, DataRelease 13, was made available in July 2016.

The Fourteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First  Spectroscopic Data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey  and from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution  Experiment

  The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been inoperation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release fromthis phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data ReleaseFourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its firsttwo years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of alldata taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon OscillationSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of theApache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2),including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machinelearning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubesfrom the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previousrelease (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format ofthe publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to theimportant technical papers describing how these data have been taken (bothtargeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSSwebsite (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links todata downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV isplanning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will befollowed by SDSS-V.

The Thirteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First  Spectroscopic Data from the SDSS-IV Survey MApping Nearby Galaxies at Apache  Point Observatory

  The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) beganobservations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, andeBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS.This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13(DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like allSDSS data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makespublicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations ofnearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. Itincludes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition totargeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selectedobjects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes newreductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometriccalibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of theAPOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previouslyincluded and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. Forthe SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometriccalibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem withDR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, andan updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location andformat of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references tothe important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and datareduction. The SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data,tutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of thereduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set thatwill contain new data and analyses from the planned ~6-year operations ofSDSS-IV.
