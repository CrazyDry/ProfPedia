One implementation of the shift cursor algorithm givesan optimal solution of the permutation generation problem, and oneimplementation of the level algorithm can be used to generate randompermutations.

On a conjecture of Bondy and Vince

  Twenty years ago Bondy and Vince conjectured that for any nonnegative integer$k$, except finitely many counterexamples, every graph with $k$ vertices ofdegree less than three contains two cycles whose lengths differ by one or two.The case $k\leq 2$ was proved by Bondy and Vince, which resolved an earlierconjecture of Erd\H{o}s et. al.. In this paper we confirm this conjecture forall $k$.

Observations of interior whispering gallery modes in asymmetric optical  resonators with rational caustics

  We propose asymmetric resonant cavities with rational caustics andexperimentally demonstrate interior whispering gallery modes in monolithicsilicon mesoscopic microcavities. These microcavities demonstrate uniquerobustness of cavity quality factor (Q) against roughness Rayleigh scattering.Angle-resolved tapered fiber measurements and near-field images observedistinct resonant families and asymmetric emission from interior whisperinggallery modes, which can be used for microcavity laser and CQED applications.

Realizing quantum controlled phase-flip gate through quantum dot in  silicon slow-light photonic crystal waveguide

  We propose a scheme to realize controlled phase gate between two singlephotons through a single quantum dot in slow-light silicon photonic crystalwaveguide. Enhanced Purcell factor and beta factor lead to high gate fidelityover broadband frequencies compared to cavity-assisted system. The excellentphysical integration of this silicon photonic crystal waveguide system providestremendous potential for large-scale quantum information processing.

Quantum entanglement in plasmonic waveguides with near-zero mode indices

  We investigate the quantum entanglement between two quantum dots in aplasmonic waveguide with near-zero mode index, considering the dependence ofconcurrence on interdot distance, quantum dot-waveguide frequency detuning andcoupling strength ratio. High concurrence is achieved for a wide range ofinterdot distance due to the near-zero mode index, which largely relaxes thestrict requirement of interdot distance in conventional dielectric waveguidesor metal nanowires. The proposed quantum dot-waveguide system with near-zerophase variation along the waveguide near the mode cutoff frequency shows verypromising potential in quantum optics and quantum information processing.

Minimum codegree threshold for $C_6^3$-factors in $3$-uniform  Hypergraphs

  Let $C_6^3$ be the 3-uniform hypergraph on $\{1,\dots, 6\}$ with edges $123,345,561$, which can be seen as the triangle in 3-uniform hypergraphs. Forsufficiently large $n$ divisible by 6, we show that every $n$-vertex 3-uniformhypergraph $H$ with minimum codegree at least $n/3$ contains a $C_6^3$-factor,i.e., a spanning subhypergraph consisting of vertex-disjoint copies of $C_6^3$.The minimum codegree condition is best possible. This improves the asymptoticalresult obtained by Mycroft and answers a question of R\"odl and Ruci\'nskiexactly.

An improved empirical equation for bunch lengthening in electron storage  rings

  In this paper we propose an improved empirical equation for the bunchlengthening in electron storage rings. The comparisons are made between theanalytical and experimental results, and the agreements are quite well. Thisimproved equation can be equally applied to the case where a storage ring isvery resistive (such as the improved SLC damping rings) instead of inductive asusual.

Giant mesoscopic spin Hall effect on surface of topological insulator

  We study mesoscopic spin Hall effect on the surface of topological insulatorwith a step-function potential. The giant spin polarization induced by atransverse electric current is derived analytically by using McMillan method inthe ballistic transport limit, which oscillates across the potential boundarywith no confinement from the potential barrier due to the Klein paradox, andshould be observable in spin resolved scanning tunneling microscope.

Simplicial Monoid Actions and The Associated Universal Simplicial Monoid  Construction

  The reduced universal monoid on the action category associated to a pointedsimplicial M-set has appeared in the guise of various simplicial monoid andgroup constructions. These include the classical constructions of Milnor andJames, as well as their later generalizations by Carlsson and Wu. We provethat, if any two n-simplices in the same orbit differ by the action of aninvertible monoid element, then the classifying space of this reduced universalmonoid is the homotopy cofiber of the inclusion from the pointed simplicial setinto its reduced Borel construction. The known formulae for the respectiveclassifying spaces of the above four constructions are special cases of thisresult. Thus, we unify categorially the four above-mentioned constructions.

Loop homological invariants associated to real projective spaces

  Let A be a based subspace of Y. Under the assumptions that Y ispath-connected and that the reduced diagonal map of A induces the zero map inall mod 2 reduced homology groups, we compute a formula for the mod 2 reducedPoincar\'{e} series of the loop space $\Omega ((A \wedge \mathbb{RP}^\infty)\cup_{A \wedge \mathbb{RP}^1} (Y \wedge \mathbb{RP}^1))$. Here$\mathbb{RP}^\infty$ and $\mathbb{RP}^1$ denote the infinite real projectivespace and the real projective line respectively.

Toric Difference Variety

  In this paper, the concept of toric difference varieties is defined and fourequivalent descriptions for toric difference varieties are presented in termsof difference rational parametrization, difference coordinate rings, toricdifference ideals, and group actions by difference tori. Connections betweentoric difference varieties and affine N[x]-semimodules are established byproving the correspondence between the irreducible invariant differencesubvarieties and the faces of the N[x]-submodules and the orbit-facecorrespondence. Finally, an algorithm is given to decide whether a binomialdifference ideal represented by a Z[x]-lattice defines a toric differencevariety.

Strongly coupled slow-light polaritons in one-dimensional disordered  localized states

  Cavity quantum electrodynamics advances the coherent control of a singlequantum emitter with a quantized radiation field mode, typically piecewiseengineered for the highest finesse and confinement in the cavity field. Thisenables the possibility of strong coupling for chip-scale quantum processing,but till now is limited to few research groups that can achieve the precisionand deterministic requirements for these polariton states. Here we observe forthe first time coherent polariton states of strong coupled single quantum dotexcitons in inherently disordered one-dimensional localized modes in slow-lightphotonic crystals. Large vacuum Rabi splittings up to 311 {\mu}eV are observed,one of the largest avoided crossings in the solid-state. Our tight-bindingmodels with quantum impurities detail these strong localized polaritons,spanning different disorder strengths, complementary to model-extracted puredephasing and incoherent pumping rates. Such disorder-induced slow-lightpolaritons provide a platform towards coherent control, collectiveinteractions, and quantum information processing.

  In order to achieve the driver function for several types of scientific CCDdetector from E2V Co Ltd, and decreasing the size of electronics of CCDdetector system, an Application-specified Integrated Circuit (ASIC) wasdesigned. It provides multi-channel clocks and bias voltage for CCD driver. Inthe ASIC, the clock drivers are made of a clock switch circuit and high voltageamplifier.

Thefirst version of design has been finished and the tests have been done.

Topology optimization of micro-structured materials featured with the  specific mechanical properties

  Micro-structured materials consisting of an array of microstructures areengineered to provide the specific material properties. This present workinvestigates the design of cellular materials under the framework of level set,so as to optimize the topologies and shapes of these porous materialmicrostructures. Firstly, the energy-based homogenization method (EBHM) isapplied to evaluate the material effective properties based on the topology ofthe material cell, where the effective elasticity property is evaluated by theaverage stress and strain theorems. Secondly, a parametric level set method(PLSM) is employed to optimize the microstructural topology until the specificmechanical properties can be achieved, including the maximum bulk modulus, themaximum shear modulus and their combinations, as well as the negative Poisson'sratio (NPR). The complicated topological shape optimization of the materialmicrostructure has been equivalent to evolve the sizes of the expansioncoefficients in the interpolation of the level set function. Finally, severalnumerical examples are fully discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of thedeveloped method. A series of new and interesting material cells with thespecific mechanical properties can be found.

  In this paper the single and multibunch emittance growths in the main linacof a linear collider are analytically treated in analogy to the Brownian motionof a molecule, and the analytical formulae for the emittance growth due toaccelerating structure misalignment errors are obtained by solving Langevinequation. The same set of formulae is derived also by solving directlyFokker-Planck equation. Comparisons with numerical simulation results are madeand the agreement is quite well.

Analytical estimation of the dynamic apertures of circular accelerators

  By considering delta function sextupole, octupole, and decapole perturbationsand using difference action-angle variable equations, we find some usefulanalytical formulae for the estimation of the dynamic apertures of circularaccelerators due to single sextupole, single octupole, single decapole (single2$m$ pole in general). Their combined effects are derived based on the Chirikovcriterion of the onset of stochastic motions. Comparisons with numericalsimulations are made, and the agreement is quite satisfactory. These formulaehave been applied to determine the beam-beam limited dynamic aperture in acircular collider.

  We propose a scheme to realize quantum controlled phase flip (CPF) betweentwo rare earth ions embedded in respective microsphere cavity via interactingwith a single-photon pulse in sequence. The numerical simulations illuminatethat the CPF gate between ions is robust and scalable with extremely highfidelity and low error rate. Our scheme is more applicable than other schemespresented before based on current laboratory cavity-QED technology, and it ispossible to be used as an applied unit gate in future quantum computation andquantum communication.

  We propose a scheme to create universal Dicke states of n largely detunedatoms through detecting the leaky photons from an optical cavity. Thegeneration of entangled states in our scheme has quasi-unit successprobability, so it has potential practicability based on current or near cominglaboratory cavity QED technology.

On the quantization accuracy of the acoustoelectric current

  By deriving analytical formulae for the quantization accuracy of theacoustoelectric current, we reveal that: 1) the flatness of the current plateaufor the typical present devices has reached the theoretical limit of about100ppm over a 1/1000 change of the gate voltage; 2) increasing the transportchannel length, and counterintuitively, increasing the acoustic wavelength aswell, would improve the quantization accuracy, and very promisingly up to0.01ppm as required for a quantum current standard.

Infrared perfect absorber based on nanowire metamaterial cavities

  An infrared perfect absorber based on gold nanowire metamaterial cavitiesarray on a gold ground plane is designed. The metamaterial made of goldnanowires embedded in alumina host exhibits an effective permittivity withstrong anisotropy, which supports cavity resonant modes of both electric dipoleand magnetic dipole. The impedance of the cavity modes matches the incidentplane wave in free space, leading to nearly perfect light absorption. Theincident optical energy is efficiently converted into heat so that the localtemperature of the absorber will increase. Simulation results show that thedesigned metamaterial absorber is polarization-insensitive and nearlyomnidirectional for the incident angle.

Broadband Epsilon-Near-Zero Metamaterials with Step-Like  Metal-Dielectric Multilayer Structures

  The concept of the broadband epsilon-near-zero meta-atom consisting oflayered stacks with specified metallic filling ratio and thickness is proposedbased on the Bergman spectral representation of the effective permittivity. Thestep-like metal-dielectric multilayer structures are designed to achieverealistic broadband epsilon-near-zero meta-atoms in optical frequency range.These meta-atoms can be integrated as building blocks for unconventionaloptical components with exotic electromagnetic properties over a wide frequencyrange, such as the demonstrated broadband directional emission and phase frontshaping.

New Method to Improve the Accelerating Gradient of Superconducting  Cavity

  Quench is a common phenomenon in a superconducting cavity and often limitsthe accelerating gradient of the cavity. Accurate location of the quench sitecan be located by second sound detection. For multi-cell superconductingcavity, one defect may cause the cell with defect quenches and then the wholecavity quenches. Now we proposed a new method to eliminate the bad influence ofthe quench cell to the whole cavity.

  Broadband electromagnetic transparency phenomenon is realized with awell-designed graded-permittivity sphere, which has an extremely low scatteringcross section over a wide frequency range, based on the generalized Miescattering theory and numerical simulation in full-wave condition. The dynamicpolarization cancellation is revealed by studying the variation of thepolarization with respect to the frequency. Furthermore, a properly-designedmulti-shell sphere is also proposed and examined in order to reduce therigorous conditions for realizing the broadband transparency in experiments.

  Extremely anisotropic metal-dielectric multilayer metamaterials are designedto have the effective permittivity tensor of a transverse component (parallelto the interfaces of the multilayer) with zero real part and a longitudinalcomponent (normal to the interfaces of the multilayer) with ultra-largeimaginary part at the same wavelength, including the optical nonlocalityanalysis based on the transfer-matrix method. The diffraction-freedeep-subwavelength optical beam propagation with near-zero phase variation inthe designed multilayer stack due to the near-flat iso-frequency contour isdemonstrated and analyzed, including the effects of the multilayer period andthe material loss.

HOMs Simulation and Measurement Results of IHEP02 Cavity

  In cavities, there exists not only the fundamental mode which is used toaccelerate the beam but also higher order modes (HOMs). The higher order modesexcited by beam can seriously affect beam quality, especially for the higherR/Q modes. This paper reports on measured results of higher order modes in theIHEP02 1.3GHz low-loss 9-cell superconducting cavity. Using different methods,Qe of the dangerous modes passbands have been got. The results are comparedwith TESLA cavity results. R/Q of the first three passbands have also been gotby simulation and compared with the results of TESLA cavity.

Based on parameters scan and considerationsfrom RF systems, a set of appropriate parameter designed for a 50Km and a 100Kmcircular proton-proton collider was proposed.

Nonlocal effective medium approximation for metallic nanorod  metamaterials

  We present an analytical nonlocal effective medium approximation to describethe optical nonlocal effects in metallic nanorod metamaterials based on Miescattering theory. It is shown that the developed nonlocal effective mediumtheory can predict a coexistence state of two modes around theepsilon-near-zero region, where strong optical nonlocal effects lead to thebehavior of both positive refraction and negative refraction in the nanorodmetamaterials. Outside of the coexistence region, only one mode can be excitedand its behavior can be well described using the local effective medium theory.

  In this paper we will show a cavity and higher order mode (HOM) couplerdesigning scheme for the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) main ring.The cavity radio frequency (RF) design parameters are showed in this paper. TheHOM power is calculated based on the beam parameters in the PreliminaryConceptual Design Report (Pre-CDR). The damping results of the higher ordermodes (HOMs) and same order modes (SOMs) show that they are reached the dampingrequirements for beam stability.

The theoretical values of geometric phase for the probebeams of EAST Polarimeter-Interferometer (POINT) system are calculated by pathintegration in parameter space. Meanwhile, the influences of some controllableparameters on geometric phase are evaluated. The feasibility and challenge ofdistinguishing geometric effect in the POINT signal are also assessed indetail.

The analytical results agree the measurements very well. This isa general method which can be applied to any electron rings.

Study of the $\bar{B}_{q}^{\ast}$ ${\to}$ $DM$ decays with perturbative  QCD approach

  The $\bar{B}_{q}^{\ast}$ ${\to}$ $DP$, $DV$ weak decays are studied with theperturbative QCD approach, where $q$ $=$ $u$, $d$ and $s$; $P$ and $V$ denotethe ground $SU(3)$ pseudoscalar and vector meson nonet. It is found that thebranching ratios for the color-allowed $\bar{B}_{q}^{\ast}$ ${\to}$$D_{q}{\rho}^{-}$ decays can reach up to $10^{-9}$ or more, and should bepromisingly measurable at the running LHC and forthcoming SuperKEKB experimentsin the near future.

Study of $J/ψ$ ${\to}$ $D_{s,d}V$ decays with perturbative QCD  approach

  Inspired by the recent measurements on two-body nonleptonic $J/{\psi}$ weakdecay at BESIII, the charm-changing $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s,d}V$ weak decaysare studied with perturbative QCD approach, where $V$ denotes ${\rho}$ and$K^{\ast}$ vector mesons. It is found that branching ratio for $J/{\psi}$${\to}$ $D_{s}{\rho}$ decay can reach up to ${\cal O}(10^{-9})$, which iswithin the potential measurement capability of the future high-luminosityexperiments.

Convergence analysis of kernel LMS algorithm with pre-tuned dictionary

  The kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm is an appealing tool for onlineidentification of nonlinear systems due to its simplicity and robustness. Inaddition to choosing a reproducing kernel and setting filter parameters,designing a KLMS adaptive filter requires to select a so-called dictionary inorder to get a finite-order model. This dictionary has a significant impact onperformance, and requires careful consideration. Theoretical analysis of KLMSas a function of dictionary setting has rarely, if ever, been addressed in theliterature. In an analysis previously published by the authors, the dictionaryelements were assumed to be governed by the same probability density functionof the input data. In this paper, we modify this study by considering thedictionary as part of the filter parameters to be set. This theoreticalanalysis paves the way for future investigations on KLMS dictionary design.

Codegree conditions for tiling complete $k$-partite $k$-graphs and loose  cycles

  Given two $k$-graphs ($k$-uniform hypergraphs) $F$ and $H$, a perfect$F$-tiling (or an $F$-factor) in $H$ is a set of vertex disjoint copies of $F$that together cover the vertex set of $H$. For all complete $k$-partite$k$-graphs $K$, Mycroft proved a minimum codegree condition that guarantees a$K$-factor in an $n$-vertex $k$-graph, which is tight up to an error term$o(n)$. In this paper we improve the error term in Mycroft's result to asub-linear term that relates to the Tur\'an number of $K$ when the differencesof the sizes of the vertex classes of $K$ are co-prime. Furthermore, we find aconstruction which shows that our improved codegree condition is asymptoticallytight in infinitely many cases thus disproving a conjecture of Mycroft. Atlast, we determine exact minimum codegree conditions for tiling $K^{(k)}(1,\dots, 1, 2)$ and tiling loose cycles thus generalizing results of Czygrinow,DeBiasio, and Nagle, and of Czygrinow, respectively.

Directional Design of Materials Based on the Pareto Optimization:  Application to Two-Dimensional Thermoelectric SnSe

  Increasing the efficiency of directional design of functional materials is achallenging work in theory, whose performance and stability are determined bydifferent factors entangled with each other complicatedly. In this work, weapply the Pareto Optimization based on the Pareto Efficiency and Particle-SwarmOptimization to design new functional materials directionally. As ademonstration, we apply the method to the thermoelectric design of 2D SnSematerials and identify several novel structures with lower free energy andbetter thermoelectric performance than the experimental monolayer structure intheory. We hope the multi-objective Pareto Optimization method can make theintegrative design of multi-objective and multi-functional materials a reality.

Novel Two-Dimensional Silicon Dioxide with in-plane Negative Poisson's  Ratio

  Silicon dioxide or silica, normally existing in various bulk crystalline andamorphous forms, is recently found to possess a two-dimensional structure. Inthis work, we use ab initio calculation and evolutionary algorithm to unveilthree new 2D silica structures whose themal, dynamical and mechanicalstabilities are compared with many typical bulk silica. In particular, we findthat all these three 2D silica have large in-plane negative Poisson's ratioswith the largest one being double of penta-graphene and three times ofborophenes. The negative Poisson's ratio originates from the interplay oflattice symmetry and Si-O tetrahedron symmetry. Slab silica is also aninsulating 2D material, with the highest electronic band gap (> 7 eV) amongreported 2D structures. These exotic 2D silica with in-plane negative Poisson'sratios and widest band gaps are expected to have great potential applicationsin nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.

Unusually low thermal conductivity of atomically thin 2D tellurium

  Tellurium is a high-performance thermoelectric material due to its superiorelectronic transport and low lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$). Here,we report the ultralow $\kappa_L$ in the monolayer tellurium, i.e., tellurene,which has been successfully synthesized in recent experiments. We findtellurene has a compellingly low room temperature $\kappa_L$ of 2.16 and 4.08 Wm$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively, whichis lower than any reported values for other 2D materials. We attribute thisunusually low $\kappa_L$ to the soft acoustic modes, extremely low-energyoptical modes and the strong scattering among optical-acoustic phonons, whichplace tellurene as a potential novel thermoelectric material. Finally, wedisclose that $\kappa_L$ is proportional to the largest acoustic phononfrequency ($\omega_{D}^{a}$) and the lowest optical phonon frequency at$\Gamma$ point ($\omega_{\Gamma}^{o}$) in 2D materials, which reflect bothharmonic and anharmonic thermal properties respectively.

To Compress, or Not to Compress: Characterizing Deep Learning Model  Compression for Embedded Inference

  The recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) make them attractive forembedded systems. However, it can take a long time for DNNs to make aninference on resource-constrained computing devices. Model compressiontechniques can address the computation issue of deep inference on embeddeddevices. This technique is highly attractive, as it does not rely onspecialized hardware, or computation-offloading that is often infeasible due toprivacy concerns or high latency. However, it remains unclear how modelcompression techniques perform across a wide range of DNNs. To design efficientembedded deep learning solutions, we need to understand their behaviors. Thiswork develops a quantitative approach to characterize model compressiontechniques on a representative embedded deep learning architecture, the NVIDIAJetson Tx2. We perform extensive experiments by considering 11 influentialneural network architectures from the image classification and the naturallanguage processing domains. We experimentally show that how two mainstreamcompression techniques, data quantization and pruning, perform on these networkarchitectures and the implications of compression techniques to the modelstorage size, inference time, energy consumption and performance metrics. Wedemonstrate that there are opportunities to achieve fast deep inference onembedded systems, but one must carefully choose the compression settings. Ourresults provide insights on when and how to apply model compression techniquesand guidelines for designing efficient embedded deep learning systems.

Design Studies for a High Current Bunching System for CLIC Test Facility  (CTF3) Drive Beam

  A bunching system is proposed for the initial stage of CTF3 which consists ofone (two) 3 GHz prebunchers and one 3 GHz travelling wave (TW) buncher withvariable phase velocities. The electron beam is emitted from a 140 KV DC gun.Since the macropulse beam current (3.5 A) at the exit of the TW buncher israther high, inside the TW buncher one has to take the beam loading effect intoconsideration. By using PARMELA, it is shown numerically that the bunchingsystem can provide the bunches whose properties satisfy the design requirementof CTF3. The 0.8 m long TW buncher working at 2pi/3 mode has two phasevelocities, 0.75 and 1. The dimensions of the caities in the two phase velocityregions are proposed considering the beam loading effect. The transient beamloading effect and the multibunch transverse instabilities are studiednumerically, and it is concluded that higher order mode couplers should beinstalled in the TW buncher with the loaded quality factor of the dipole modelower than 80.

Edge superconducting state in attractive U Kane-Mele-Hubbard model

  We theoretically investigate the phase transition from topological insulator(TI) to superconductor in the attractive U Kane-Mele-Hubbard model withself-consistent mean field method. We demonstrate the existence of edgesuperconducting state (ESS), in which the bulk is still an insulator and thesuperconductivity only appears near the edges. The ESS results from the specialenergy dispersion of TI, and is a general property of the superconductivity inTI. The phase transition in this model essentially consists of two steps. Whenthe attractive U becomes nonzero, ESS appears immediately. After the attractiveU exceeds a critical value $U_c$, the whole system becomes a superconductor.The effective model of the ESS has also been discussed and we believe that theconception of ESS can be realized in atomic optical lattice system.

Stacking order, interaction and weak surface magnetism in layered  graphene sheets

  Recent transport experiments have demonstrated that the rhombohedral stackingtrilayer graphene is an insulator with an intrinsic gap of 6meV and the Bernalstacking trilayer one is a metal. We propose a Hubbard model with a moderate$U$ for layered graphene sheets, and show that the model well explains theexperiments of the stacking dependent energy gap. The on-site Coulomb repulsiondrives the metallic phase of the non-interacting system to a weak surfaceantiferromagnetic insulator for the rhombohedral stacking layers, but does notalter the metallic phase for the Bernal stacking layers.

Homology Decompositions of the Loops on 1-Stunted Borel Constructions of  C_2-Actions

  Carlsson's construction is a simplicial group whose geometric realization isthe loop space of the 1-stunted reduced Borel construction. Our main resultsare: i) Given a pointed simplicial set acted upon by the discrete cyclic groupC_2 of order 2, if the orbit projection has a section, then this loop space hasa mod 2 homology decomposition; ii) If the reduced diagonal map of theC_2-invariant set is homologous to zero, then the pinched sets in the abovehomology decomposition themselves have homology decompositions in terms of theC_2-invariant set and the orbit space. Result i) generalizes a previoushomology decomposition of the second author for trivial actions. To illustratethese two results, we completely compute the mod 2 Betti numbers for anexample.

Source Delay in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

  Source delay, the time a packet experiences in its source node, serves as afundamental quantity for delay performance analysis in networks. However, thesource delay performance in highly dynamic mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) isstill largely unknown by now. This paper studies the source delay in MANETsbased on a general packet dispatching scheme with dispatch limit $f$ (PD-$f$for short), where a same packet will be dispatched out up to $f$ times by itssource node such that packet dispatching process can be flexibly controlledthrough a proper setting of $f$. We first apply the Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD)theory to develop a theoretical framework to capture the complex packetdispatching process in PD-$f$ MANETs. With the help of the theoreticalframework, we then derive the cumulative distribution function as well as meanand variance of the source delay in such networks. Finally, extensivesimulation and theoretical results are provided to validate our source delayanalysis and illustrate how source delay in MANETs are related to networkparameters.

Pressure of Degenerate and Relativistic electrons in a superhigh  magnetic field

  Based on our previous work, we deduce a general formula for pressure ofdegenerate and relativistic electrons,Pe, which is suitable for superhighmagnetic fields, discuss the quantization of Landau levels of electrons, andconsider the quantum electrodynam-ic(QED) effects on the equations of states(EOSs) for different matter systems. The main conclusions are as follows:Pe isrelated to the magnetic field B, matter density ?, and electron fraction Ye ;the stronger the magnetic field, the higher the electron pressure becomes; thehigh electron pressure could be caused by high Fermi energy of electrons in asuperhigh magnetic field; compared with a common radio pulsar, a magnetar couldbe a more compact oblate spheroid-like deformed neutron star due to theanisotropic total pressure; and an increase in the maximum mass of a magnetaris expected because of the positive contribution of the magnetic field energyto the EOS of the star.

Three-component topological superfluid in one-dimensional Fermi gases  with spin-orbit coupling

  We theoretically investigate one-dimensional three-componentspin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases in the presence of Zeeman field. By solving theBogoliubov-de-Gennes equations, we obtain the phase diagram at given chemicalpotential and order parameter. We show that the system undergoes a phasetransition from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid to topological superfluidas increasing the intensity of Zeeman field. By comparing to the two-componentsystem, we find, besides the topological phase transition from the trivialsuperfluid to nontrivial topological superfluid, the system can always be in anontrivial topological superfluid, and there are two Majorana zero energyregions while increasing the magnetic field. We find the three-componentspin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases in certain parameter range is more optimizingfor experimental realization due to the smaller magnetic field needed. Wetherefore propose a promising candidate for realizing topological superfluid.

Sparse Data Driven Mesh Deformation

  Example-based mesh deformation methods are powerful tools for realistic shapeediting. However, existing techniques typically combine all the exampledeformation modes, which can lead to overfitting, i.e. using a overlycomplicated model to explain the user-specified deformation. This leads toimplausible or unstable deformation results, including unexpected globalchanges outside the region of interest. To address this fundamental limitation,we propose a sparse blending method that automatically selects a smaller numberof deformation modes to compactly describe the desired deformation. This alongwith a suitably chosen deformation basis including spatially localizeddeformation modes leads to significant advantages, including more meaningful,reliable, and efficient deformations because fewer and localized deformationmodes are applied. To cope with large rotations, we develop a simple buteffective representation based on polar decomposition of deformation gradients,which resolves the ambiguity of large global rotations using anas-consistent-as-possible global optimization. This simple representation has aclosed form solution for derivatives, making it efficient for sparse localizedrepresentation and thus ensuring interactive performance. Experimental resultsshow that our method outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven mesh deformationmethods, for both quality of results and efficiency.

Energy-Efficient Thermal Comfort Control in Smart Buildings via Deep  Reinforcement Learning

  Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is extremelyenergy-consuming, accounting for 40% of total building energy consumption.Therefore, it is crucial to design some energy-efficient building thermalcontrol policies which can reduce the energy consumption of HVAC whilemaintaining the comfort of the occupants. However, implementing such a policyis challenging, because it involves various influencing factors in a buildingenvironment, which are usually hard to model and may be different from case tocase. To address this challenge, we propose a deep reinforcement learning basedframework for energy optimization and thermal comfort control in smartbuildings. We formulate the building thermal control as a cost-minimizationproblem which jointly considers the energy consumption of HVAC and the thermalcomfort of the occupants. To solve the problem, we first adopt a deep neuralnetwork based approach for predicting the occupants' thermal comfort, and thenadopt Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) for learning the thermalcontrol policy. To evaluate the performance, we implement a building thermalcontrol simulation system and evaluate the performance under various settings.The experiment results show that our method can improve the thermal comfortprediction accuracy, and reduce the energy consumption of HVAC while improvingthe occupants' thermal comfort.
