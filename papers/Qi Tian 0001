In situ epitaxial MgB2 thin films for superconducting electronics

  A thin film technology compatible with multilayer device fabrication iscritical for exploring the potential of the 39-K superconductor magnesiumdiboride for superconducting electronics. Using a Hybrid Physical-ChemicalVapor Deposition (HPCVD) process, it is shown that the high Mg vapor pressurenecessary to keep the MgB$_2$ phase thermodynamically stable can be achievedfor the {\it in situ} growth of MgB$_2$ thin films. The films grow epitaxiallyon (0001) sapphire and (0001) 4H-SiC substrates and show a bulk-like $T_c$ of39 K, a $J_c$(4.2K) of $1.2 \times 10^7$ A/cm$^2$ in zero field, and a$H_{c2}(0)$ of 29.2 T in parallel magnetic field. The surface is smooth with aroot-mean-square roughness of 2.5 nm for MgB$_2$ films on SiC. This depositionmethod opens tremendous opportunities for superconducting electronics usingMgB$_2$.
