Integrating citizen science with online learning to ask better questions

  Online learners spend millions of hours per year testing their new skills onassignments with known answers. This paper explores whether framing researchquestions as assignments with unknown answers helps learners generate novel,useful, and difficult-to-find knowledge while increasing their motivation bycontributing to a larger goal. Collaborating with the American Gut Project, theworld's largest crowdfunded citizen science project, we deploy Gut Instinct toallow novices to generate hypotheses about the constitution of the human gutmicrobiome. The tool enables online learners to explore learning material aboutthe microbiome and create their own theories around causal variances formicrobiome. Building on crowdsourcing or serious games that use people asreplaceable units, this work-in-progress lays our plans for how people (a) usetheir personal knowledge (b) towards solving a larger real-world goal (c) thatcan provide potential benefits to them. We hope to demonstrate that GutInstinct citizen scientists generate useful hypotheses, perform better onlearning tasks than traditional MOOC learners, and are better engaged with thelearning material.
