Simple, Fast, and Scalable Reachability Oracle

  A reachability oracle (or hop labeling) assigns each vertex v two sets ofvertices: Lout(v) and Lin(v), such that u reaches v iff Lout(u) \cap Lin(v)\neq \emptyset. Despite their simplicity and elegance, reachability oracleshave failed to achieve efficiency in more than ten years since theirintroduction: the main problem is high construction cost, which stems from aset-cover framework and the need to materialize transitive closure. In thispaper, we present two simple and efficient labeling algorithms,Hierarchical-Labeling and Distribution-Labeling, which can work onmassivereal-world graphs: their construction time is an order of magnitude faster thanthe setcover based labeling approach, and transitive closure materialization isnot needed. On large graphs, their index sizes and their query performance cannow beat the state-of-the-art transitive closure compression and online searchapproaches.

Limiting the Neighborhood: De-Small-World Network for Outbreak  Prevention

  In this work, we study a basic and practically important strategy to helpprevent and/or delay an outbreak in the context of network: limiting thecontact between individuals. In this paper, we introduce the averageneighborhood size as a new measure for the degree of being small-world andutilize it to formally define the desmall- world network problem. We also provethe NP-hardness of the general reachable pair cut problem and propose a greedyedge betweenness based approach as the benchmark in selecting the candidateedges for solving our problem. Furthermore, we transform the de-small-worldnetwork problem as an OR-AND Boolean function maximization problem, which isalso an NP-hardness problem. In addition, we develop a numerical relaxationapproach to solve the Boolean function maximization and the de-small-worldproblem. Also, we introduce the short-betweenness, which measures the edgeimportance in terms of all short paths with distance no greater than a certainthreshold, and utilize it to speed up our numerical relaxation approach. Theexperimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of ourapproaches.

Network Backbone Discovery Using Edge Clustering

  In this paper, we investigate the problem of network backbone discovery. Incomplex systems, a "backbone" takes a central role in carrying out the systemfunctionality and carries the bulk of system traffic. It also both simplifiesand highlight underlying networking structure. Here, we propose an integratedgraph theoretical and information theoretical network backbone model. Wedevelop an efficient mining algorithm based on Kullback-Leibler divergenceoptimization procedure and maximal weight connected subgraph discoveryprocedure. A detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates both theeffectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The case studies in the realworld domain further illustrates the usefulness of the discovered networkbackbones.

Preserving Differential Privacy in Adversarial Learning with Provable  Robustness

  In this paper, we aim to develop a novel mechanism to preserve differentialprivacy (DP) in adversarial learning for deep neural networks, with provablerobustness to adversarial examples. We leverage the sequential compositiontheory in differential privacy, to establish a new connection betweendifferential privacy preservation and provable robustness. To address thetrade-off among model utility, privacy loss, and robustness, we design anoriginal, differentially private, adversarial objective function, based on thepost-processing property in differential privacy, to tighten the sensitivity ofour model. Theoretical analysis and thorough evaluations show that ourmechanism notably improves the robustness of DP deep neural networks.

Hub-Accelerator: Fast and Exact Shortest Path Computation in Large  Social Networks

  Shortest path computation is one of the most fundamental operations formanaging and analyzing large social networks. Though existing techniques arequite effective for finding the shortest path on large but sparse roadnetworks, social graphs have quite different characteristics: they aregenerally non-spatial, non-weighted, scale-free, and they exhibit small-worldproperties in addition to their massive size. In particular, the existence ofhubs, those vertices with a large number of connections, explodes the searchspace, making the shortest path computation surprisingly challenging. In thispaper, we introduce a set of novel techniques centered around hubs,collectively referred to as the Hub-Accelerator framework, to compute thek-degree shortest path (finding the shortest path between two vertices if theirdistance is within k). These techniques enable us to significantly reduce thesearch space by either greatly limiting the expansion scope of hubs (using thenovel distance- preserving Hub-Network concept) or completely pruning away thehubs in the online search (using the Hub2-Labeling approach). TheHub-Accelerator approaches are more than two orders of magnitude faster thanBFS and the state-of-the-art approximate shortest path method Sketch for theshortest path computation. The Hub- Network approach does not introduceadditional index cost with light pre-computation cost; the index size and indexconstruction cost of Hub2-Labeling are also moderate and better than orcomparable to the approximation indexing Sketch method.

Distance Preserving Graph Simplification

  Large graphs are difficult to represent, visualize, and understand. In thispaper, we introduce "gate graph" - a new approach to perform graphsimplification. A gate graph provides a simplified topological view of theoriginal graph. Specifically, we construct a gate graph from a large graph sothat for any "non-local" vertex pair (distance higher than some threshold) inthe original graph, their shortest-path distance can be recovered byconsecutive "local" walks through the gate vertices in the gate graph. Weperform a theoretical investigation on the gate-vertex set discovery problem.We characterize its computational complexity and reveal the upper bound ofminimum gate-vertex set using VC-dimension theory. We propose an efficientmining algorithm to discover a gate-vertex set with guaranteed logarithmicbound. We further present a fast technique for pruning redundant edges in agate graph. The detailed experimental results using both real and syntheticgraphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Large Scale Real-time Ridesharing with Service Guarantee on Road  Networks

  The mean occupancy rates of personal vehicle trips in the United States isonly 1.6 persons per vehicle mile. Urban traffic gridlock is a familiar scene.Ridesharing has the potential to solve many environmental, congestion, andenergy problems. In this paper, we introduce the problem of large scalereal-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks. Servers and triprequests are dynamically matched while waiting time and service timeconstraints of trips are satisfied. We first propose two basic algorithms: abranch-and-bound algorithm and an integer programing algorithm. However, thesealgorithm structures do not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the ridesharingproblem. Thus, we then propose a kinetic tree algorithm capable of betterscheduling dynamic requests and adjusting routes on-the-fly. We performexperiments on a large real taxi dataset from Shanghai. The results show thatthe kinetic tree algorithm is faster than other algorithms in response time.

Relational Approach for Shortest Path Discovery over Large Graphs

  With the rapid growth of large graphs, we cannot assume that graphs can stillbe fully loaded into memory, thus the disk-based graph operation is inevitable.In this paper, we take the shortest path discovery as an example to investigatethe technique issues when leveraging existing infrastructure of relationaldatabase (RDB) in the graph data management. Based on the observation that avariety of graph search queries can be implemented by iterative operationsincluding selecting frontier nodes from visited nodes, making expansion fromthe selected frontier nodes, and merging the expanded nodes into the visitedones, we introduce a relational FEM framework with three correspondingoperators to implement graph search tasks in the RDB context. We show newfeatures such as window function and merge statement introduced by recent SQLstandards can not only simplify the expression but also improve the performanceof the FEM framework. In addition, we propose two optimization strategiesspecific to shortest path discovery inside the FEM framework. First, we take abi-directional set Dijkstra's algorithm in the path finding. The bi-directionalstrategy can reduce the search space, and set Dijkstra's algorithm finds theshortest path in a set-at-a-time fashion. Second, we introduce an index namedSegTable to preserve the local shortest segments, and exploit SegTable tofurther improve the performance. The final extensive experimental resultsillustrate our relational approach with the optimization strategies achieveshigh scalability and performance.

Axiomatic Ranking of Network Role Similarity

  A key task in social network and other complex network analysis is roleanalysis: describing and categorizing nodes according to how they interact withother nodes. Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent setsof neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence.Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism arenonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence may be rare, a more meaningfultask is to measure the role similarity between any two nodes. This task isclosely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRankattempts to solve. However, SimRank and most of its offshoots are notsufficient because they do not fully recognize automorphically or structurallyequivalent nodes. In this paper we tackle two problems. First, what are thenecessary properties for a role similarity measure or metric? Second, how canwe derive a role similarity measure satisfying these properties? For the firstproblem, we justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a rolesimilarity measure or metric: range, maximal similarity, automorphicequivalence, transitive similarity, and the triangle inequality. For the secondproblem, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric with a simple iterativecomputational method. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all theaxiomatic properties. We also introduce an iceberg RoleSim algorithm which canguarantee to discover all pairs with RoleSim score no less than a user-definedthreshold $\theta$ without computing the RoleSim for every pair. We demonstratethe superior interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and realdatasets.

A Deep Embedding Model for Co-occurrence Learning

  Co-occurrence Data is a common and important information source in manyareas, such as the word co-occurrence in the sentences, friends co-occurrencein social networks and products co-occurrence in commercial transaction data,etc, which contains rich correlation and clustering information about theitems. In this paper, we study co-occurrence data using a general energy-basedprobabilistic model, and we analyze three different categories of energy-basedmodel, namely, the $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_k$ models, which are able to capturedifferent levels of dependency in the co-occurrence data. We also discuss howseveral typical existing models are related to these three types of energymodels, including the Fully Visible Boltzmann Machine (FVBM) ($L_2$), MatrixFactorization ($L_2$), Log-BiLinear (LBL) models ($L_2$), and the RestrictedBoltzmann Machine (RBM) model ($L_k$). Then, we propose a Deep Embedding Model(DEM) (an $L_k$ model) from the energy model in a \emph{principled} manner.Furthermore, motivated by the observation that the partition function in theenergy model is intractable and the fact that the major objective of modelingthe co-occurrence data is to predict using the conditional probability, weapply the \emph{maximum pseudo-likelihood} method to learn DEM. In consequence,the developed model and its learning method naturally avoid the abovedifficulties and can be easily used to compute the conditional probability inprediction. Interestingly, our method is equivalent to learning a specialstructured deep neural network using back-propagation and a special samplingstrategy, which makes it scalable on large-scale datasets. Finally, in theexperiments, we show that the DEM can achieve comparable or better results thanstate-of-the-art methods on datasets across several application domains.
