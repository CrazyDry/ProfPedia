Neural Networks for Joint Sentence Classification in Medical Paper  Abstracts

  Existing models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sentenceclassification often do not incorporate the context in which sentences appear,and classify sentences individually. However, traditional sentenceclassification approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointlyclassifying subsequent sentences, such as with conditional random fields. Inthis work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness oftypical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength ofstructured prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on twodifferent datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts.

The Use of Autoencoders for Discovering Patient Phenotypes

  We use autoencoders to create low-dimensional embeddings of underlyingpatient phenotypes that we hypothesize are a governing factor in determininghow different patients will react to different interventions. We compare theperformance of autoencoders that take fixed length sequences of concatenatedtimesteps as input with a recurrent sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. Weevaluate our methods on around 35,500 patients from the latest MIMIC IIIdataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.

MIT at SemEval-2017 Task 10: Relation Extraction with Convolutional  Neural Networks

  Over 50 million scholarly articles have been published: they constitute aunique repository of knowledge. In particular, one may infer from themrelations between scientific concepts, such as synonyms and hyponyms.Artificial neural networks have been recently explored for relation extraction.In this work, we continue this line of work and present a system based on aconvolutional neural network to extract relations. Our model ranked first inthe SemEval-2017 task 10 (ScienceIE) for relation extraction in scientificarticles (subtask C).

Modeling Mistrust in End-of-Life Care

  In this work, we characterize the doctor-patient relationship using a machinelearning-derived trust score. We show that this score has statisticallysignificant racial associations, and that by modeling trust directly we findstronger disparities in care than by stratifying on race. We furtherdemonstrate that mistrust is indicative of worse outcomes, but is only weaklyassociated with physiologically-created severity scores. Finally, we describesentiment analysis experiments indicating patients with higher levels ofmistrust have worse experiences and interactions with their caregivers. Thiswork is a step towards measuring fairer machine learning in the healthcaredomain.

Hierarchical Neural Networks for Sequential Sentence Classification in  Medical Scientific Abstracts

  Prevalent models based on artificial neural network (ANN) for sentenceclassification often classify sentences in isolation without considering thecontext in which sentences appear. This hampers the traditional sentenceclassification approaches to the problem of sequential sentence classification,where structured prediction is needed for better overall classificationperformance. In this work, we present a hierarchical sequential labelingnetwork to make use of the contextual information within surrounding sentencesto help classify the current sentence. Our model outperforms thestate-of-the-art results by 2%-3% on two benchmarking datasets for sequentialsentence classification in medical scientific abstracts.

Global Conditioning for Probabilistic Inference in Belief Networks

  In this paper we propose a new approach to probabilistic inference on beliefnetworks, global conditioning, which is a simple generalization of Pearl's(1986b) method of loopcutset conditioning. We show that global conditioning, aswell as loop-cutset conditioning, can be thought of as a special case of themethod of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter (1988) as refined by Jensen et al (199Oa;1990b). Nonetheless, this approach provides new opportunities for parallelprocessing and, in the case of sequential processing, a tradeoff of time formemory. We also show how a hybrid method (Suermondt and others 1990) combiningloop-cutset conditioning with Jensen's method can be viewed within ourframework. By exploring the relationships between these methods, we develop aunifying framework in which the advantages of each approach can be combinedsuccessfully.

NeuroNER: an easy-to-use program for named-entity recognition based on  neural networks

  Named-entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying entities of interest in atext. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have recently been shown to outperformexisting NER systems. However, ANNs remain challenging to use for non-expertusers. In this paper, we present NeuroNER, an easy-to-use named-entityrecognition tool based on ANNs. Users can annotate entities using a graphicalweb-based user interface (BRAT): the annotations are then used to train an ANN,which in turn predict entities' locations and categories in new texts. NeuroNERmakes this annotation-training-prediction flow smooth and accessible to anyone.

Transfer Learning for Named-Entity Recognition with Neural Networks

  Recent approaches based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shownpromising results for named-entity recognition (NER). In order to achieve highperformances, ANNs need to be trained on a large labeled dataset. However,labels might be difficult to obtain for the dataset on which the user wants toperform NER: label scarcity is particularly pronounced for patient notede-identification, which is an instance of NER. In this work, we analyze towhat extent transfer learning may address this issue. In particular, wedemonstrate that transferring an ANN model trained on a large labeled datasetto another dataset with a limited number of labels improves upon thestate-of-the-art results on two different datasets for patient notede-identification.

Continuous State-Space Models for Optimal Sepsis Treatment - a Deep  Reinforcement Learning Approach

  Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) andcosts hospitals billions annually. Treating a septic patient is highlychallenging, because individual patients respond very differently to medicalinterventions and there is no universally agreed-upon treatment for sepsis.Understanding more about a patient's physiological state at a given time couldhold the key to effective treatment policies. In this work, we propose a newapproach to deduce optimal treatment policies for septic patients by usingcontinuous state-space models and deep reinforcement learning. Learningtreatment policies over continuous spaces is important, because we retain moreof the patient's physiological information. Our model is able to learnclinically interpretable treatment policies, similar in important aspects tothe treatment policies of physicians. Evaluating our algorithm on past ICUpatient data, we find that our model could reduce patient mortality in thehospital by up to 3.6% over observed clinical policies, from a baselinemortality of 13.7%. The learned treatment policies could be used to aidintensive care clinicians in medical decision making and improve the likelihoodof patient survival.

Clinical Intervention Prediction and Understanding using Deep Networks

  Real-time prediction of clinical interventions remains a challenge withinintensive care units (ICUs). This task is complicated by data sources that arenoisy, sparse, heterogeneous and outcomes that are imbalanced. In this paper,we integrate data from all available ICU sources (vitals, labs, notes,demographics) and focus on learning rich representations of this data topredict onset and weaning of multiple invasive interventions. In particular, wecompare both long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neuralnetworks (CNN) for prediction of five intervention tasks: invasive ventilation,non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloidboluses. Our predictions are done in a forward-facing manner to enable"real-time" performance, and predictions are made with a six hour gap time tosupport clinically actionable planning. We achieve state-of-the-art results onour predictive tasks using deep architectures. We explore the use of featureocclusion to interpret LSTM models, and compare this to the interpretabilitygained from examining inputs that maximally activate CNN outputs. We show thatour models are able to significantly outperform baselines in interventionprediction, and provide insight into model learning, which is crucial for theadoption of such models in practice.

Representation and Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Glycemic  Control in Septic Patients

  Glycemic control is essential for critical care. However, it is a challengingtask because there has been no study on personalized optimal strategies forglycemic control. This work aims to learn personalized optimal glycemictrajectories for severely ill septic patients by learning data-driven policiesto identify optimal targeted blood glucose levels as a reference forclinicians. We encoded patient states using a sparse autoencoder and adopted areinforcement learning paradigm using policy iteration to learn the optimalpolicy from data. We also estimated the expected return following the policylearned from the recorded glycemic trajectories, which yielded a functionindicating the relationship between real blood glucose values and 90-daymortality rates. This suggests that the learned optimal policy could reduce thepatients' estimated 90-day mortality rate by 6.3%, from 31% to 24.7%. Theresult demonstrates that reinforcement learning with appropriate patient stateencoding can potentially provide optimal glycemic trajectories and allowclinicians to design a personalized strategy for glycemic control in septicpatients.

CliNER 2.0: Accessible and Accurate Clinical Concept Extraction

  Clinical notes often describe important aspects of a patient's stay and aretherefore critical to medical research. Clinical concept extraction (CCE) ofnamed entities - such as problems, tests, and treatments - aids in forming anunderstanding of notes and provides a foundation for many downstream clinicaldecision-making tasks. Historically, this task has been posed as a standardnamed entity recognition (NER) sequence tagging problem, and solved withfeature-based methods using handengineered domain knowledge. Recent advances,however, have demonstrated the efficacy of LSTM-based models for NER tasks,including CCE. This work presents CliNER 2.0, a simple-to-install, open-sourcetool for extracting concepts from clinical text. CliNER 2.0 uses a word- andcharacter- level LSTM model, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Forease of use, the tool also includes pre-trained models available for publicuse.

Towards the Creation of a Large Corpus of Synthetically-Identified  Clinical Notes

  Clinical notes often describe the most important aspects of a patient'sphysiology and are therefore critical to medical research. However, these notesare typically inaccessible to researchers without prior removal of sensitiveprotected health information (PHI), a natural language processing (NLP) taskreferred to as deidentification. Tools to automatically de-identify clinicalnotes are needed but are difficult to create without access to those very samenotes containing PHI. This work presents a first step toward creating a largesynthetically-identified corpus of clinical notes and corresponding PHIannotations in order to facilitate the development de-identification tools.Further, one such tool is evaluated against this corpus in order to understandthe advantages and shortcomings of this approach.

Mapping Unparalleled Clinical Professional and Consumer Languages with  Embedding Alignment

  Mapping and translating professional but arcane clinical jargons to consumerlanguage is essential to improve the patient-clinician communication.Researchers have used the existing biomedical ontologies and consumer healthvocabulary dictionary to translate between the languages. However, suchapproaches are limited by expert efforts to manually build the dictionary,which is hard to be generalized and scalable. In this work, we utilized theembeddings alignment method for the word mapping between unparalleled clinicalprofessional and consumer language embeddings. To map semantically similarwords in two different word embeddings, we first independently trained wordembeddings on both the corpus with abundant clinical professional terms and theother with mainly healthcare consumer terms. Then, we aligned the embeddings bythe Procrustes algorithm. We also investigated the approach with theadversarial training with refinement. We evaluated the quality of the alignmentthrough the similar words retrieval both by computing the model precision andas well as judging qualitatively by human. We show that the Procrustesalgorithm can be performant for the professional consumer language embeddingsalignment, whereas adversarial training with refinement may find some relationsbetween two languages.

Racial Disparities and Mistrust in End-of-Life Care

  There are established racial disparities in healthcare, including duringend-of-life care, when poor communication and trust can lead to suboptimaloutcomes for patients and their families. In this work, we find that racialdisparities which have been reported in existing literature are also present inthe MIMIC-III database. We hypothesize that one underlying cause of thisdisparity is due to mistrust between patient and caregivers, and we developmultiple possible trust metric proxies (using coded interpersonal variables andclinical notes) to measure this phenomenon more directly. These metrics showeven stronger disparities in end-of-life care than race does, and they alsotend to demonstrate statistically significant higher levels of mistrust forblack patients than white ones. Finally, we demonstrate that these metricsimprove performance on three clinical tasks: in-hospital mortality, dischargeagainst medical advice (AMA) and modified care status (e.g., DNR, DNI, etc.).

Advancing PICO Element Detection in Medical Text via Deep Neural  Networks

  In evidence-based medicine (EBM), structured medical questions are alwaysfavored for efficient search of the best available evidence for treatments.PICO element detection is widely used to help structurize the clinical studiesand question by identifying the sentences in a given medical text that belongto one of the four components: Participants (P), Intervention (I), Comparison(C), and Outcome (O). In this work, we propose a hierarchical deep neuralnetwork (DNN) architecture that contains dual bi-directional long short-termmemory (bi-LSTM) layers to automatically detect the PICO element in medicaltexts. Within the model, the lower layer of bi-LSTM is for sentence encodingwhile the upper one is to contextualize the encoded sentence representationvector. In addition, we adopt adversarial and virtual adversarial training toregularize the model. Overall, we advance the PICO element detection to newstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming the previous works by at least 4\%in F1 score for all P/I/O categories.

Implementing a Portable Clinical NLP System with a Common Data Model - a  Lisp Perspective

  This paper presents a Lisp architecture for a portable NLP system, termedLAPNLP, for processing clinical notes. LAPNLP integrates multiple standard,customized and in-house developed NLP tools. Our system facilitates portabilityacross different institutions and data systems by incorporating an enrichedCommon Data Model (CDM) to standardize necessary data elements. It utilizesUMLS to perform domain adaptation when integrating generic domain NLP tools. Italso features stand-off annotations that are specified by positional referenceto the original document. We built an interval tree based search engine toefficiently query and retrieve the stand-off annotations by specifyingpositional requirements. We also developed a utility to convert an inlineannotation format to stand-off annotations to enable the reuse of clinical textdatasets with inline annotations. We experimented with our system on severalNLP facilitated tasks including computational phenotyping for lymphoma patientsand semantic relation extraction for clinical notes. These experimentsshowcased the broader applicability and utility of LAPNLP.

Unsupervised Multimodal Representation Learning across Medical Images  and Reports

  Joint embeddings between medical imaging modalities and associated radiologyreports have the potential to offer significant benefits to the clinicalcommunity, ranging from cross-domain retrieval to conditional generation ofreports to the broader goals of multimodal representation learning. In thiswork, we establish baseline joint embedding results measured via both local andglobal retrieval methods on the soon to be released MIMIC-CXR datasetconsisting of both chest X-ray images and the associated radiology reports. Weexamine both supervised and unsupervised methods on this task and show that fordocument retrieval tasks with the learned representations, only a limitedamount of supervision is needed to yield results comparable to those offully-supervised methods.

Unsupervised Clinical Language Translation

  As patients' access to their doctors' clinical notes becomes common,translating professional, clinical jargon to layperson-understandable languageis essential to improve patient-clinician communication. Such translationyields better clinical outcomes by enhancing patients' understanding of theirown health conditions, and thus improving patients' involvement in their owncare. Existing research has used dictionary-based word replacement ordefinition insertion to approach the need. However, these methods are limitedby expert curation, which is hard to scale and has trouble generalizing tounseen datasets that do not share an overlapping vocabulary. In contrast, weapproach the clinical word and sentence translation problem in a completelyunsupervised manner. We show that a framework using representation learning,bilingual dictionary induction and statistical machine translation yields thebest precision at 10 of 0.827 on professional-to-consumer word translation, andmean opinion scores of 4.10 and 4.28 out of 5 for clinical correctness andlayperson readability, respectively, on sentence translation. Ourfully-unsupervised strategy overcomes the curation problem, and the clinicallymeaningful evaluation reduces biases from inappropriate evaluators, which arecritical in clinical machine learning.

Clinically Accurate Chest X-Ray Report Generation

  The automatic generation of radiology reports given medical radiographs hassignificant potential to operationally and clinically improve patient care. Anumber of prior works have focused on this problem, employing advanced methodsfrom computer vision and natural language generation to produce readablereports. However, these works often fail to account for the particular nuancesof the radiology domain, and, in particular, the critical importance ofclinical accuracy in the resulting generated reports. In this work, we presenta domain-aware automatic chest X-Ray radiology report generation system whichfirst predicts what topics will be discussed in the report, then conditionallygenerates sentences corresponding to these topics. The resulting system isfine-tuned using reinforcement learning, considering both readability andclinical accuracy, as assessed by the proposed Clinically Coherent Reward. Weverify this system on two datasets, Open-I and MIMIC-CXR, and demonstrate thatour model offers marked improvements on both language generation metrics andCheXpert assessed accuracy over a variety of competitive baselines.

De-identification of Patient Notes with Recurrent Neural Networks

  Objective: Patient notes in electronic health records (EHRs) may containcritical information for medical investigations. However, the vast majority ofmedical investigators can only access de-identified notes, in order to protectthe confidentiality of patients. In the United States, the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of protected healthinformation (PHI) that needs to be removed to de-identify patient notes. Manualde-identification is impractical given the size of EHR databases, the limitednumber of researchers with access to the non-de-identified notes, and thefrequent mistakes of human annotators. A reliable automated de-identificationsystem would consequently be of high value.  Materials and Methods: We introduce the first de-identification system basedon artificial neural networks (ANNs), which requires no handcrafted features orrules, unlike existing systems. We compare the performance of the system withstate-of-the-art systems on two datasets: the i2b2 2014 de-identificationchallenge dataset, which is the largest publicly available de-identificationdataset, and the MIMIC de-identification dataset, which we assembled and istwice as large as the i2b2 2014 dataset.  Results: Our ANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. It yields anF1-score of 97.85 on the i2b2 2014 dataset, with a recall 97.38 and a precisionof 97.32, and an F1-score of 99.23 on the MIMIC de-identification dataset, witha recall 99.25 and a precision of 99.06.  Conclusion: Our findings support the use of ANNs for de-identification ofpatient notes, as they show better performance than previously publishedsystems while requiring no feature engineering.

Feature-Augmented Neural Networks for Patient Note De-identification

  Patient notes contain a wealth of information of potentially great interestto medical investigators. However, to protect patients' privacy, ProtectedHealth Information (PHI) must be removed from the patient notes before they canbe legally released, a process known as patient note de-identification. Themain objective for a de-identification system is to have the highest possiblerecall. Recently, the first neural-network-based de-identification system hasbeen proposed, yielding state-of-the-art results. Unlike other systems, it doesnot rely on human-engineered features, which allows it to be quickly deployed,but does not leverage knowledge from human experts or from electronic healthrecords (EHRs). In this work, we explore a method to incorporatehuman-engineered features as well as features derived from EHRs to aneural-network-based de-identification system. Our results show that theaddition of features, especially the EHR-derived features, further improves thestate-of-the-art in patient note de-identification, including for some of themost sensitive PHI types such as patient names. Since in a real-life settingpatient notes typically come with EHRs, we recommend developers ofde-identification systems to leverage the information EHRs contain.

Predicting Blood Pressure Response to Fluid Bolus Therapy Using  Attention-Based Neural Networks for Clinical Interpretability

  Determining whether hypotensive patients in intensive care units (ICUs)should receive fluid bolus therapy (FBT) has been an extremely challenging taskfor intensive care physicians as the corresponding increase in blood pressurehas been hard to predict. Our study utilized regression models andattention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms and a multi-clinicalinformation system large-scale database to build models that can predict thesuccessful response to FBT among hypotensive patients in ICUs. We investigatedboth time-aggregated modeling using logistic regression algorithms withregularization and time-series modeling using the long short term memorynetwork (LSTM) and the gated recurrent units network (GRU) with the attentionmechanism for clinical interpretability. Among all modeling strategies, thestacked LSTM with the attention mechanism yielded the most predictable modelwith the highest accuracy of 0.852 and area under the curve (AUC) value of0.925. The study results may help identify hypotensive patients in ICUs whowill have sufficient blood pressure recovery after FBT.
