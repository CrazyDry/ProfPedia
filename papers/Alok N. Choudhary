Microstructural Materials Design via Deep Adversarial Learning
  Methodology

  Identifying the key microstructure representations is crucial for
Computational Materials Design (CMD). However, existing microstructure
characterization and reconstruction (MCR) techniques have limitations to be
applied for materials design. Model-based MCR approaches do not have parameters
that can serve as design variables, while MCR techniques that rely on dimension
reduction tend to lose important microstructural information. In this work, we
present a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitations
of existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarial
networks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables and
microstructures. Thereafter, the low-dimensional latent variables serve as
design variables, and a Bayesian optimization framework is applied to obtain
microstructures with desired material property. Due to the special design of
the network architecture, the proposed methodology is able to identify the
latent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize the
information loss even for complex material microstructures. The validity of the
proposed methodology is tested numerically on a synthetic microstructure
dataset and its effectiveness for materials design is evaluated through a case
study of optimizing optical performance for energy absorption. In addition, the
scalability and transferability of proposed methodology are also demonstrated
in this work. Specifically, the proposed methodology is scalable to generate
arbitrary sized microstructures, and it can serve as a pre-trained model to
improve the performance of a structure-property predictive model via transfer
learning.


A Parallel Monte Carlo Code for Simulating Collisional N-body Systems

  We present a new parallel code for computing the dynamical evolution of
collisional N-body systems with up to N~10^7 particles. Our code is based on
the the Henon Monte Carlo method for solving the Fokker-Planck equation, and
makes assumptions of spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium. The
principal algorithmic developments involve optimizing data structures, and the
introduction of a parallel random number generation scheme, as well as a
parallel sorting algorithm, required to find nearest neighbors for interactions
and to compute the gravitational potential. The new algorithms we introduce
along with our choice of decomposition scheme minimize communication costs and
ensure optimal distribution of data and workload among the processing units.
The implementation uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for
communication, which makes it portable to many different supercomputing
architectures. We validate the code by calculating the evolution of clusters
with initial Plummer distribution functions up to core collapse with the number
of stars, N, spanning three orders of magnitude, from 10^5 to 10^7. We find
that our results are in good agreement with self-similar core-collapse
solutions, and the core collapse times generally agree with expectations from
the literature. Also, we observe good total energy conservation, within less
than 0.04% throughout all simulations. We analyze the performance of the code,
and demonstrate near-linear scaling of the runtime with the number of
processors up to 64 processors for N=10^5, 128 for N=10^6 and 256 for N=10^7.
The runtime reaches a saturation with the addition of more processors beyond
these limits which is a characteristic of the parallel sorting algorithm. The
resulting maximum speedups we achieve are approximately 60x, 100x, and 220x,
respectively.
