Localized Optimal Control of Spatiotemporal Chaos

  A linear output feedback control scheme is developed for a coupled maplattice system. H-infinity control theory is used to make the scheme local:both the collection of information and the feedback are implemented through anarray of locally coupled control sites. Robustness properties of the controlscheme are discussed.

Controller Synthesis with Inductive Proofs for Piecewise Linear Systems:  an SMT-based Algorithm

  We present a controller synthesis algorithm for reach-avoid problems forpiecewise linear discrete-time systems. Our algorithm relies on SMT solvers andin this paper we focus on piecewise constant control strategies. Our algorithmgenerates feedback control laws together with inductive proofs of unboundedtime safety and progress properties with respect to the reach-avoid sets. Undera reasonable robustness assump- tion, the algorithm is shown to be complete.That is, it either generates a controller of the above type along with a proofof correctness, or it establishes the impossibility of the existence of suchcontrollers. To achieve this, the algorithm iteratively attempts to solve aweakened and strengthened versions of the SMT encoding of the reach-avoidproblem. We present preliminary experimental results on applying this algorithmbased on a prototype implementation.
