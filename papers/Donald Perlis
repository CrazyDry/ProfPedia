Multi-Hypothesis Visual-Inertial Flow

  Estimating the correspondences between pixels in sequences of images is acritical first step for a myriad of tasks including vision-aided navigation(e.g., visual odometry (VO), visual-inertial odometry (VIO), and visualsimultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM)) and anomaly detection. Weintroduce a new unsupervised deep neural network architecture called the VisualInertial Flow (VIFlow) network and demonstrate image correspondence and opticalflow estimation by an unsupervised multi-hypothesis deep neural networkreceiving grayscale imagery and extra-visual inertial measurements. VIFlowlearns to combine heterogeneous sensor streams and sample from an unknown,un-parametrized noise distribution to generate several (4 or 8 in this work)probable hypotheses on the pixel-level correspondence mappings between a sourceimage and a target image . We quantitatively benchmark VIFlow against severalleading vision-only dense correspondence and flow methods and show asubstantial decrease in runtime and increase in efficiency compared to allmethods with similar performance to state-of-the-art (SOA) dense correspondencematching approaches. We also present qualitative results showing how VIFlow canbe used for detecting anomalous independent motion.
