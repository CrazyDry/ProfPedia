Qualitative Probabilistic Networks for Planning Under Uncertainty

  Bayesian networks provide a probabilistic semantics for qualitative
assertions about likelihood. A qualitative reasoner based on an algebra over
these assertions can derive further conclusions about the influence of actions.
While the conclusions are much weaker than those computed from complete
probability distributions, they are still valuable for suggesting potential
actions, eliminating obviously inferior plans, identifying important tradeoffs,
and explaining probabilistic models.


The Structure of Signals: Causal Interdependence Models for Games of
  Incomplete Information

  Traditional economic models typically treat private information, or signals,
as generated from some underlying state. Recent work has explicated alternative
models, where signals correspond to interpretations of available information.
We show that the difference between these formulations can be sharply cast in
terms of causal dependence structure, and employ graphical models to illustrate
the distinguishing characteristics. The graphical representation supports
inferences about signal patterns in the interpreted framework, and suggests how
results based on the generated model can be extended to more general
situations. Specific insights about bidding games in classical auction
mechanisms derive from qualitative graphical models.


State-space Abstraction for Anytime Evaluation of Probabilistic Networks

  One important factor determining the computational complexity of evaluating a
probabilistic network is the cardinality of the state spaces of the nodes. By
varying the granularity of the state spaces, one can trade off accuracy in the
result for computational efficiency. We present an anytime procedure for
approximate evaluation of probabilistic networks based on this idea. On
application to some simple networks, the procedure exhibits a smooth
improvement in approximation quality as computation time increases. This
suggests that state-space abstraction is one more useful control parameter for
designing real-time probabilistic reasoners.


Exploiting Functional Dependencies in Qualitative Probabilistic
  Reasoning

  Functional dependencies restrict the potential interactions among variables
connected in a probabilistic network. This restriction can be exploited in
qualitative probabilistic reasoning by introducing deterministic variables and
modifying the inference rules to produce stronger conclusions in the presence
of functional relations. I describe how to accomplish these modifications in
qualitative probabilistic networks by exhibiting the update procedures for
graphical transformations involving probabilistic and deterministic variables
and combinations. A simple example demonstrates that the augmented scheme can
reduce qualitative ambiguity that would arise without the special treatment of
functional dependency. Analysis of qualitative synergy reveals that new
higher-order relations are required to reason effectively about synergistic
interactions among deterministic variables.


Self-Confirming Price Prediction Strategies for Simultaneous One-Shot
  Auctions

  Bidding in simultaneous auctions is challenging because an agent's value for
a good in one auction may depend on the uncertain outcome of other auctions:
the so-called exposure problem. Given the gap in understanding of general
simultaneous auction games, previous works have tackled this problem with
heuristic strategies that employ probabilistic price predictions. We define a
concept of self-confirming prices, and show that within an independent private
value model, Bayes-Nash equilibrium can be fully characterized as a profile of
optimal price prediction strategies with self-confirming predictions. We
exhibit practical procedures to compute approximately optimal bids given a
probabilistic price prediction, and near self-confirming price predictions
given a price-prediction strategy. An extensive empirical game-theoretic
analysis demonstrates that self-confirming price prediction strategies are
effective in simultaneous auction games with both complementary and
substitutable preference structures.


Path Planning under Time-Dependent Uncertainty

  Standard algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph require that the
cost of a path be additive in edge costs, and typically assume that costs are
deterministic. We consider the problem of uncertain edge costs, with potential
probabilistic dependencies among the costs. Although these dependencies violate
the standard dynamic-programming decomposition, we identify a weaker stochastic
consistency condition that justifies a generalized dynamic-programming approach
based on stochastic dominance. We present a revised path-planning algorithm and
prove that it produces optimal paths under time-dependent uncertain costs. We
test the algorithm by applying it to a model of stochastic bus networks, and
present empirical performance results comparing it to some alternatives.
Finally, we consider extensions of these concepts to a more general class of
problems of heuristic search under uncertainty.


The Role of Calculi in Uncertain Inference Systems

  Much of the controversy about methods for automated decision making has
focused on specific calculi for combining beliefs or propagating uncertainty.
We broaden the debate by (1) exploring the constellation of secondary tasks
surrounding any primary decision problem, and (2) identifying knowledge
engineering concerns that present additional representational tradeoffs. We
argue on pragmatic grounds that the attempt to support all of these tasks
within a single calculus is misguided. In the process, we note several
uncertain reasoning objectives that conflict with the Bayesian ideal of
complete specification of probabilities and utilities. In response, we advocate
treating the uncertainty calculus as an object language for reasoning
mechanisms that support the secondary tasks. Arguments against Bayesian
decision theory are weakened when the calculus is relegated to this role.
Architectures for uncertainty handling that take statements in the calculus as
objects to be reasoned about offer the prospect of retaining normative status
with respect to decision making while supporting the other tasks in uncertain
reasoning.


Analyzing Incentives for Protocol Compliance in Complex Domains: A Case
  Study of Introduction-Based Routing

  Formal analyses of incentives for compliance with network protocols often
appeal to game-theoretic models and concepts. Applications of game-theoretic
analysis to network security have generally been limited to highly stylized
models, where simplified environments enable tractable study of key strategic
variables. We propose a simulation-based approach to game-theoretic analysis of
protocol compliance, for scenarios with large populations of agents and large
policy spaces. We define a general procedure for systematically exploring a
structured policy space, directed expressly to resolve the qualitative
classification of equilibrium behavior as compliant or non-compliant. The
techniques are illustrated and exercised through an extensive case study
analyzing compliance incentives for introduction-based routing. We find that
the benefits of complying with the protocol are particularly strong for nodes
subject to attack, and the overall compliance level achieved in equilibrium,
while not universal, is sufficient to support the desired security goals of the
protocol.


Toward a Market Model for Bayesian Inference

  We present a methodology for representing probabilistic relationships in a
general-equilibrium economic model. Specifically, we define a precise mapping
from a Bayesian network with binary nodes to a market price system where
consumers and producers trade in uncertain propositions. We demonstrate the
correspondence between the equilibrium prices of goods in this economy and the
probabilities represented by the Bayesian network. A computational market model
such as this may provide a useful framework for investigations of belief
aggregation, distributed probabilistic inference, resource allocation under
uncertainty, and other problems of decentralized uncertainty.


Computing Best-Response Strategies in Infinite Games of Incomplete
  Information

  We describe an algorithm for computing best response strategies in a class of
two-player infinite games of incomplete information, defined by payoffs
piecewise linear in agents' types and actions, conditional on linear
comparisons of agents' actions. We show that this class includes many
well-known games including a variety of auctions and a novel allocation game.
In some cases, the best-response algorithm can be iterated to compute
Bayes-Nash equilibria. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on
existing and new games.


Using Qualitative Relationships for Bounding Probability Distributions

  We exploit qualitative probabilistic relationships among variables for
computing bounds of conditional probability distributions of interest in
Bayesian networks. Using the signs of qualitative relationships, we can
implement abstraction operations that are guaranteed to bound the distributions
of interest in the desired direction. By evaluating incrementally improved
approximate networks, our algorithm obtains monotonically tightening bounds
that converge to exact distributions. For supermodular utility functions, the
tightening bounds monotonically reduce the set of admissible decision
alternatives as well.


Optimal Factory Scheduling using Stochastic Dominance A*

  We examine a standard factory scheduling problem with stochastic processing
and setup times, minimizing the expectation of the weighted number of tardy
jobs. Because the costs of operators in the schedule are stochastic and
sequence dependent, standard dynamic programming algorithms such as A* may fail
to find the optimal schedule. The SDA* (Stochastic Dominance A*) algorithm
remedies this difficulty by relaxing the pruning condition. We present an
improved state-space search formulation for these problems and discuss the
conditions under which stochastic scheduling problems can be solved optimally
using SDA*. In empirical testing on randomly generated problems, we found that
in 70%, the expected cost of the optimal stochastic solution is lower than that
of the solution derived using a deterministic approximation, with comparable
search effort.


Accounting for Context in Plan Recognition, with Application to Traffic
  Monitoring

  Typical approaches to plan recognition start from a representation of an
agent's possible plans, and reason evidentially from observations of the
agent's actions to assess the plausibility of the various candidates. A more
expansive view of the task (consistent with some prior work) accounts for the
context in which the plan was generated, the mental state and planning process
of the agent, and consequences of the agent's actions in the world. We present
a general Bayesian framework encompassing this view, and focus on how context
can be exploited in plan recognition. We demonstrate the approach on a problem
in traffic monitoring, where the objective is to induce the plan of the driver
from observation of vehicle movements. Starting from a model of how the driver
generates plans, we show how the highway context can appropriately influence
the recognizer's interpretation of observed driver behavior.


The Automated Mapping of Plans for Plan Recognition

  To coordinate with other agents in its environment, an agent needs models of
what the other agents are trying to do. When communication is impossible or
expensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition.
Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of the
possible plans the other agents may be following, and develop special
techniques for discriminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirable
would be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures supporting
inference based on uncertain and incomplete observations. In this paper, we
describe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexible
procedural language to observation models represented as probabilistic belief
networks.


Self-Confirming Price Prediction for Bidding in Simultaneous Ascending
  Auctions

  Simultaneous ascending auctions present agents with the exposure problem:
bidding to acquire a bundle risks the possibility of obtaining an undesired
subset of the goods. Auction theory provides little guidance for dealing with
this problem. We present a new family of decisiontheoretic bidding strategies
that use probabilistic predictions of final prices. We focus on selfconfirming
price distribution predictions, which by definition turn out to be correct when
all agents bid decision-theoretically based on them. Bidding based on these is
provably not optimal in general, but our experimental evidence indicates the
strategy can be quite effective compared to other known methods.


Compact Securities Markets for Pareto Optimal Reallocation of Risk

  The emph{securities market} is the fundamental theoretical framework in
economics and finance for resource allocation under uncertainty. Securities
serve both to reallocate risk and to disseminate probabilistic information.
emph{Complete} securities markets - which contain one security for every
possible state of nature - support Pareto optimal allocations of risk. Complete
markets suffer from the same exponential dependence on the number of underlying
events as do joint probability distributions. We examine whether markets can be
structured and "compacted" in the same manner as Bayesian network
representations of joint distributions. We show that, if all agents'
risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market
structure, then the market is emph{operationally complete}: risk is still
Pareto optimally allocated, yet the number of securities can be exponentially
smaller. For collections of agents of a certain type, agreement on Markov
independencies is sufficient to admit compact and operationally complete
markets.


Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars for Plan Recognition

  Techniques for plan recognition under uncertainty require a stochastic model
of the plan-generation process. We introduce Probabilistic State-Dependent
Grammars (PSDGs) to represent an agent's plan-generation process. The PSDG
language model extends probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) by allowing
production probabilities to depend on an explicit model of the planning agent's
internal and external state. Given a PSDG description of the plan-generation
process, we can then use inference algorithms that exploit the particular
independence properties of the PSDG language to efficiently answer
plan-recognition queries. The combination of the PSDG language model and
inference algorithms extends the range of plan-recognition domains for which
practical probabilistic inference is possible, as illustrated by applications
in traffic monitoring and air combat.


Graphical Representations of Consensus Belief

  Graphical models based on conditional independence support concise encodings
of the subjective belief of a single agent. A natural question is whether the
consensus belief of a group of agents can be represented with equal parsimony.
We prove, under relatively mild assumptions, that even if everyone agrees on a
common graph topology, no method of combining beliefs can maintain that
structure. Even weaker conditions rule out local aggregation within conditional
probability tables. On a more positive note, we show that if probabilities are
combined with the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP), then commonly held Markov
independencies are maintained. This suggests a straightforward procedure for
constructing a consensus Markov network. We describe an algorithm for computing
the LogOP with time complexity comparable to that of exact Bayesian inference.


Incremental Tradeoff Resolution in Qualitative Probabilistic Networks

  Qualitative probabilistic reasoning in a Bayesian network often reveals
tradeoffs: relationships that are ambiguous due to competing qualitative
influences. We present two techniques that combine qualitative and numeric
probabilistic reasoning to resolve such tradeoffs, inferring the qualitative
relationship between nodes in a Bayesian network. The first approach
incrementally marginalizes nodes that contribute to the ambiguous qualitative
relationships. The second approach evaluates approximate Bayesian networks for
bounds of probability distributions, and uses these bounds to determinate
qualitative relationships in question. This approach is also incremental in
that the algorithm refines the state spaces of random variables for tighter
bounds until the qualitative relationships are resolved. Both approaches
provide systematic methods for tradeoff resolution at potentially lower
computational cost than application of purely numeric methods.


Multiattribute Auctions Based on Generalized Additive Independence

  We develop multiattribute auctions that accommodate generalized additive
independent (GAI) preferences. We propose an iterative auction mechanism that
maintains prices on potentially overlapping GAI clusters of attributes, thus
decreases elicitation and computational burden, and creates an open competition
among suppliers over a multidimensional domain. Most significantly, the auction
is guaranteed to achieve surplus which approximates optimal welfare up to a
small additive factor, under reasonable equilibrium strategies of traders. The
main departure of GAI auctions from previous literature is to accommodate
non-additive trader preferences, hence allowing traders to condition their
evaluation of specific attributes on the value of other attributes. At the same
time, the GAI structure supports a compact representation of prices, enabling a
tractable auction process. We perform a simulation study, demonstrating and
quantifying the significant efficiency advantage of more expressive preference
modeling. We draw random GAI-structured utility functions with various internal
structures, generate additive functions that approximate the GAI utility, and
compare the performance of the auctions using the two representations. We find
that allowing traders to express existing dependencies among attributes
improves the economic efficiency of multiattribute auctions.


Knowledge Combination in Graphical Multiagent Model

  A graphical multiagent model (GMM) represents a joint distribution over the
behavior of a set of agents. One source of knowledge about agents' behavior may
come from gametheoretic analysis, as captured by several graphical game
representations developed in recent years. GMMs generalize this approach to
express arbitrary distributions, based on game descriptions or other sources of
knowledge bearing on beliefs about agent behavior. To illustrate the
flexibility of GMMs, we exhibit game-derived models that allow probabilistic
deviation from equilibrium, as well as models based on heuristic action choice.
We investigate three different methods of integrating these models into a
single model representing the combined knowledge sources. To evaluate the
predictive performance of the combined model, we treat as actual outcome the
behavior produced by a reinforcement learning process. We find that combining
the two knowledge sources, using any of the methods, provides better
predictions than either source alone. Among the combination methods, mixing
data outperforms the opinion pool and direct update methods investigated in
this empirical trial.


Constrained Automated Mechanism Design for Infinite Games of Incomplete
  Information

  We present a functional framework for automated mechanism design based on a
two-stage game model of strategic interaction between the designer and the
mechanism participants, and apply it to several classes of two-player infinite
games of incomplete information. At the core of our framework is a black-box
optimization algorithm which guides the selection process of candidate
mechanisms. Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in several
application domains using various objective functions. By comparing our results
with known optimal mechanisms, and in some cases improving on the best known
mechanisms, we provide evidence that ours is a promising approach to parametric
design of indirect mechanisms.


Representing Aggregate Belief through the Competitive Equilibrium of a
  Securities Market

  We consider the problem of belief aggregation: given a group of individual
agents with probabilistic beliefs over a set of uncertain events, formulate a
sensible consensus or aggregate probability distribution over these events.
Researchers have proposed many aggregation methods, although on the question of
which is best the general consensus is that there is no consensus. We develop a
market-based approach to this problem, where agents bet on uncertain events by
buying or selling securities contingent on their outcomes. Each agent acts in
the market so as to maximize expected utility at given securities prices,
limited in its activity only by its own risk aversion. The equilibrium prices
of goods in this market represent aggregate beliefs. For agents with constant
risk aversion, we demonstrate that the aggregate probability exhibits several
desirable properties, and is related to independently motivated techniques. We
argue that the market-based approach provides a plausible mechanism for belief
aggregation in multiagent systems, as it directly addresses self-motivated
agent incentives for participation and for truthfulness, and can provide a
decision-theoretic foundation for the "expert weights" often employed in
centralized pooling techniques.


Characterizing Strategic Cascades on Networks

  Transmission of disease, spread of information and rumors, adoption of new
products, and many other network phenomena can be fruitfully modeled as
cascading processes, where actions chosen by nodes influence the subsequent
behavior of neighbors in the network graph. Current literature on cascades
tends to assume nodes choose myopically based on the state of choices already
taken by other nodes. We examine the possibility of strategic choice, where
agents representing nodes anticipate the choices of others who have not yet
decided, and take into account their own influence on such choices. Our study
employs the framework of Chierichetti et al. [2012], who (under assumption of
myopic node behavior) investigate the scheduling of node decisions to promote
cascades of product adoptions preferred by the scheduler. We show that when
nodes behave strategically, outcomes can be extremely different. We exhibit
cases where in the strategic setting 100% of agents adopt, but in the myopic
setting only an arbitrarily small epsilon % do. Conversely, we present cases
where in the strategic setting 0% of agents adopt, but in the myopic setting
(100-epsilon)% do, for any constant epsilon > 0. Additionally, we prove some
properties of cascade processes with strategic agents, both in general and for
particular classes of graphs.
