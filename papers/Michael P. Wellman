Qualitative Probabilistic Networks for Planning Under Uncertainty

  Bayesian networks provide a probabilistic semantics for qualitativeassertions about likelihood. A qualitative reasoner based on an algebra overthese assertions can derive further conclusions about the influence of actions.While the conclusions are much weaker than those computed from completeprobability distributions, they are still valuable for suggesting potentialactions, eliminating obviously inferior plans, identifying important tradeoffs,and explaining probabilistic models.

The Structure of Signals: Causal Interdependence Models for Games of  Incomplete Information

  Traditional economic models typically treat private information, or signals,as generated from some underlying state. Recent work has explicated alternativemodels, where signals correspond to interpretations of available information.We show that the difference between these formulations can be sharply cast interms of causal dependence structure, and employ graphical models to illustratethe distinguishing characteristics. The graphical representation supportsinferences about signal patterns in the interpreted framework, and suggests howresults based on the generated model can be extended to more generalsituations. Specific insights about bidding games in classical auctionmechanisms derive from qualitative graphical models.

State-space Abstraction for Anytime Evaluation of Probabilistic Networks

  One important factor determining the computational complexity of evaluating aprobabilistic network is the cardinality of the state spaces of the nodes. Byvarying the granularity of the state spaces, one can trade off accuracy in theresult for computational efficiency. We present an anytime procedure forapproximate evaluation of probabilistic networks based on this idea. Onapplication to some simple networks, the procedure exhibits a smoothimprovement in approximation quality as computation time increases. Thissuggests that state-space abstraction is one more useful control parameter fordesigning real-time probabilistic reasoners.

Exploiting Functional Dependencies in Qualitative Probabilistic  Reasoning

  Functional dependencies restrict the potential interactions among variablesconnected in a probabilistic network. This restriction can be exploited inqualitative probabilistic reasoning by introducing deterministic variables andmodifying the inference rules to produce stronger conclusions in the presenceof functional relations. I describe how to accomplish these modifications inqualitative probabilistic networks by exhibiting the update procedures forgraphical transformations involving probabilistic and deterministic variablesand combinations. A simple example demonstrates that the augmented scheme canreduce qualitative ambiguity that would arise without the special treatment offunctional dependency. Analysis of qualitative synergy reveals that newhigher-order relations are required to reason effectively about synergisticinteractions among deterministic variables.

Self-Confirming Price Prediction Strategies for Simultaneous One-Shot  Auctions

  Bidding in simultaneous auctions is challenging because an agent's value fora good in one auction may depend on the uncertain outcome of other auctions:the so-called exposure problem. Given the gap in understanding of generalsimultaneous auction games, previous works have tackled this problem withheuristic strategies that employ probabilistic price predictions. We define aconcept of self-confirming prices, and show that within an independent privatevalue model, Bayes-Nash equilibrium can be fully characterized as a profile ofoptimal price prediction strategies with self-confirming predictions. Weexhibit practical procedures to compute approximately optimal bids given aprobabilistic price prediction, and near self-confirming price predictionsgiven a price-prediction strategy. An extensive empirical game-theoreticanalysis demonstrates that self-confirming price prediction strategies areeffective in simultaneous auction games with both complementary andsubstitutable preference structures.

Path Planning under Time-Dependent Uncertainty

  Standard algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph require that thecost of a path be additive in edge costs, and typically assume that costs aredeterministic. We consider the problem of uncertain edge costs, with potentialprobabilistic dependencies among the costs. Although these dependencies violatethe standard dynamic-programming decomposition, we identify a weaker stochasticconsistency condition that justifies a generalized dynamic-programming approachbased on stochastic dominance. We present a revised path-planning algorithm andprove that it produces optimal paths under time-dependent uncertain costs. Wetest the algorithm by applying it to a model of stochastic bus networks, andpresent empirical performance results comparing it to some alternatives.Finally, we consider extensions of these concepts to a more general class ofproblems of heuristic search under uncertainty.

The Role of Calculi in Uncertain Inference Systems

  Much of the controversy about methods for automated decision making hasfocused on specific calculi for combining beliefs or propagating uncertainty.We broaden the debate by (1) exploring the constellation of secondary taskssurrounding any primary decision problem, and (2) identifying knowledgeengineering concerns that present additional representational tradeoffs. Weargue on pragmatic grounds that the attempt to support all of these taskswithin a single calculus is misguided. In the process, we note severaluncertain reasoning objectives that conflict with the Bayesian ideal ofcomplete specification of probabilities and utilities. In response, we advocatetreating the uncertainty calculus as an object language for reasoningmechanisms that support the secondary tasks. Arguments against Bayesiandecision theory are weakened when the calculus is relegated to this role.Architectures for uncertainty handling that take statements in the calculus asobjects to be reasoned about offer the prospect of retaining normative statuswith respect to decision making while supporting the other tasks in uncertainreasoning.

Analyzing Incentives for Protocol Compliance in Complex Domains: A Case  Study of Introduction-Based Routing

  Formal analyses of incentives for compliance with network protocols oftenappeal to game-theoretic models and concepts. Applications of game-theoreticanalysis to network security have generally been limited to highly stylizedmodels, where simplified environments enable tractable study of key strategicvariables. We propose a simulation-based approach to game-theoretic analysis ofprotocol compliance, for scenarios with large populations of agents and largepolicy spaces. We define a general procedure for systematically exploring astructured policy space, directed expressly to resolve the qualitativeclassification of equilibrium behavior as compliant or non-compliant. Thetechniques are illustrated and exercised through an extensive case studyanalyzing compliance incentives for introduction-based routing. We find thatthe benefits of complying with the protocol are particularly strong for nodessubject to attack, and the overall compliance level achieved in equilibrium,while not universal, is sufficient to support the desired security goals of theprotocol.

Computing Best-Response Strategies in Infinite Games of Incomplete  Information

  We describe an algorithm for computing best response strategies in a class oftwo-player infinite games of incomplete information, defined by payoffspiecewise linear in agents' types and actions, conditional on linearcomparisons of agents' actions. We show that this class includes manywell-known games including a variety of auctions and a novel allocation game.In some cases, the best-response algorithm can be iterated to computeBayes-Nash equilibria. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach onexisting and new games.

Using Qualitative Relationships for Bounding Probability Distributions

  We exploit qualitative probabilistic relationships among variables forcomputing bounds of conditional probability distributions of interest inBayesian networks. Using the signs of qualitative relationships, we canimplement abstraction operations that are guaranteed to bound the distributionsof interest in the desired direction. By evaluating incrementally improvedapproximate networks, our algorithm obtains monotonically tightening boundsthat converge to exact distributions. For supermodular utility functions, thetightening bounds monotonically reduce the set of admissible decisionalternatives as well.

Toward a Market Model for Bayesian Inference

  We present a methodology for representing probabilistic relationships in ageneral-equilibrium economic model. Specifically, we define a precise mappingfrom a Bayesian network with binary nodes to a market price system whereconsumers and producers trade in uncertain propositions. We demonstrate thecorrespondence between the equilibrium prices of goods in this economy and theprobabilities represented by the Bayesian network. A computational market modelsuch as this may provide a useful framework for investigations of beliefaggregation, distributed probabilistic inference, resource allocation underuncertainty, and other problems of decentralized uncertainty.

Knowledge Combination in Graphical Multiagent Model

  A graphical multiagent model (GMM) represents a joint distribution over thebehavior of a set of agents. One source of knowledge about agents' behavior maycome from gametheoretic analysis, as captured by several graphical gamerepresentations developed in recent years. GMMs generalize this approach toexpress arbitrary distributions, based on game descriptions or other sources ofknowledge bearing on beliefs about agent behavior. To illustrate theflexibility of GMMs, we exhibit game-derived models that allow probabilisticdeviation from equilibrium, as well as models based on heuristic action choice.We investigate three different methods of integrating these models into asingle model representing the combined knowledge sources. To evaluate thepredictive performance of the combined model, we treat as actual outcome thebehavior produced by a reinforcement learning process. We find that combiningthe two knowledge sources, using any of the methods, provides betterpredictions than either source alone. Among the combination methods, mixingdata outperforms the opinion pool and direct update methods investigated inthis empirical trial.

Constrained Automated Mechanism Design for Infinite Games of Incomplete  Information

  We present a functional framework for automated mechanism design based on atwo-stage game model of strategic interaction between the designer and themechanism participants, and apply it to several classes of two-player infinitegames of incomplete information. At the core of our framework is a black-boxoptimization algorithm which guides the selection process of candidatemechanisms. Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in severalapplication domains using various objective functions. By comparing our resultswith known optimal mechanisms, and in some cases improving on the best knownmechanisms, we provide evidence that ours is a promising approach to parametricdesign of indirect mechanisms.

Self-Confirming Price Prediction for Bidding in Simultaneous Ascending  Auctions

  Simultaneous ascending auctions present agents with the exposure problem:bidding to acquire a bundle risks the possibility of obtaining an undesiredsubset of the goods. Auction theory provides little guidance for dealing withthis problem. We present a new family of decisiontheoretic bidding strategiesthat use probabilistic predictions of final prices. We focus on selfconfirmingprice distribution predictions, which by definition turn out to be correct whenall agents bid decision-theoretically based on them. Bidding based on these isprovably not optimal in general, but our experimental evidence indicates thestrategy can be quite effective compared to other known methods.

Compact Securities Markets for Pareto Optimal Reallocation of Risk

  The emph{securities market} is the fundamental theoretical framework ineconomics and finance for resource allocation under uncertainty. Securitiesserve both to reallocate risk and to disseminate probabilistic information.emph{Complete} securities markets - which contain one security for everypossible state of nature - support Pareto optimal allocations of risk. Completemarkets suffer from the same exponential dependence on the number of underlyingevents as do joint probability distributions. We examine whether markets can bestructured and "compacted" in the same manner as Bayesian networkrepresentations of joint distributions. We show that, if all agents'risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the marketstructure, then the market is emph{operationally complete}: risk is stillPareto optimally allocated, yet the number of securities can be exponentiallysmaller. For collections of agents of a certain type, agreement on Markovindependencies is sufficient to admit compact and operationally completemarkets.

Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars for Plan Recognition

  Techniques for plan recognition under uncertainty require a stochastic modelof the plan-generation process. We introduce Probabilistic State-DependentGrammars (PSDGs) to represent an agent's plan-generation process. The PSDGlanguage model extends probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) by allowingproduction probabilities to depend on an explicit model of the planning agent'sinternal and external state. Given a PSDG description of the plan-generationprocess, we can then use inference algorithms that exploit the particularindependence properties of the PSDG language to efficiently answerplan-recognition queries. The combination of the PSDG language model andinference algorithms extends the range of plan-recognition domains for whichpractical probabilistic inference is possible, as illustrated by applicationsin traffic monitoring and air combat.

Graphical Representations of Consensus Belief

  Graphical models based on conditional independence support concise encodingsof the subjective belief of a single agent. A natural question is whether theconsensus belief of a group of agents can be represented with equal parsimony.We prove, under relatively mild assumptions, that even if everyone agrees on acommon graph topology, no method of combining beliefs can maintain thatstructure. Even weaker conditions rule out local aggregation within conditionalprobability tables. On a more positive note, we show that if probabilities arecombined with the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP), then commonly held Markovindependencies are maintained. This suggests a straightforward procedure forconstructing a consensus Markov network. We describe an algorithm for computingthe LogOP with time complexity comparable to that of exact Bayesian inference.

Incremental Tradeoff Resolution in Qualitative Probabilistic Networks

  Qualitative probabilistic reasoning in a Bayesian network often revealstradeoffs: relationships that are ambiguous due to competing qualitativeinfluences. We present two techniques that combine qualitative and numericprobabilistic reasoning to resolve such tradeoffs, inferring the qualitativerelationship between nodes in a Bayesian network. The first approachincrementally marginalizes nodes that contribute to the ambiguous qualitativerelationships. The second approach evaluates approximate Bayesian networks forbounds of probability distributions, and uses these bounds to determinatequalitative relationships in question. This approach is also incremental inthat the algorithm refines the state spaces of random variables for tighterbounds until the qualitative relationships are resolved. Both approachesprovide systematic methods for tradeoff resolution at potentially lowercomputational cost than application of purely numeric methods.

Optimal Factory Scheduling using Stochastic Dominance A*

  We examine a standard factory scheduling problem with stochastic processingand setup times, minimizing the expectation of the weighted number of tardyjobs. Because the costs of operators in the schedule are stochastic andsequence dependent, standard dynamic programming algorithms such as A* may failto find the optimal schedule. The SDA* (Stochastic Dominance A*) algorithmremedies this difficulty by relaxing the pruning condition. We present animproved state-space search formulation for these problems and discuss theconditions under which stochastic scheduling problems can be solved optimallyusing SDA*. In empirical testing on randomly generated problems, we found thatin 70%, the expected cost of the optimal stochastic solution is lower than thatof the solution derived using a deterministic approximation, with comparablesearch effort.

Accounting for Context in Plan Recognition, with Application to Traffic  Monitoring

  Typical approaches to plan recognition start from a representation of anagent's possible plans, and reason evidentially from observations of theagent's actions to assess the plausibility of the various candidates. A moreexpansive view of the task (consistent with some prior work) accounts for thecontext in which the plan was generated, the mental state and planning processof the agent, and consequences of the agent's actions in the world. We presenta general Bayesian framework encompassing this view, and focus on how contextcan be exploited in plan recognition. We demonstrate the approach on a problemin traffic monitoring, where the objective is to induce the plan of the driverfrom observation of vehicle movements. Starting from a model of how the drivergenerates plans, we show how the highway context can appropriately influencethe recognizer's interpretation of observed driver behavior.

The Automated Mapping of Plans for Plan Recognition

  To coordinate with other agents in its environment, an agent needs models ofwhat the other agents are trying to do. When communication is impossible orexpensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition.Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of thepossible plans the other agents may be following, and develop specialtechniques for discriminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirablewould be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures supportinginference based on uncertain and incomplete observations. In this paper, wedescribe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexibleprocedural language to observation models represented as probabilistic beliefnetworks.

Multiattribute Auctions Based on Generalized Additive Independence

  We develop multiattribute auctions that accommodate generalized additiveindependent (GAI) preferences. We propose an iterative auction mechanism thatmaintains prices on potentially overlapping GAI clusters of attributes, thusdecreases elicitation and computational burden, and creates an open competitionamong suppliers over a multidimensional domain. Most significantly, the auctionis guaranteed to achieve surplus which approximates optimal welfare up to asmall additive factor, under reasonable equilibrium strategies of traders. Themain departure of GAI auctions from previous literature is to accommodatenon-additive trader preferences, hence allowing traders to condition theirevaluation of specific attributes on the value of other attributes. At the sametime, the GAI structure supports a compact representation of prices, enabling atractable auction process. We perform a simulation study, demonstrating andquantifying the significant efficiency advantage of more expressive preferencemodeling. We draw random GAI-structured utility functions with various internalstructures, generate additive functions that approximate the GAI utility, andcompare the performance of the auctions using the two representations. We findthat allowing traders to express existing dependencies among attributesimproves the economic efficiency of multiattribute auctions.

Representing Aggregate Belief through the Competitive Equilibrium of a  Securities Market

  We consider the problem of belief aggregation: given a group of individualagents with probabilistic beliefs over a set of uncertain events, formulate asensible consensus or aggregate probability distribution over these events.Researchers have proposed many aggregation methods, although on the question ofwhich is best the general consensus is that there is no consensus. We develop amarket-based approach to this problem, where agents bet on uncertain events bybuying or selling securities contingent on their outcomes. Each agent acts inthe market so as to maximize expected utility at given securities prices,limited in its activity only by its own risk aversion. The equilibrium pricesof goods in this market represent aggregate beliefs. For agents with constantrisk aversion, we demonstrate that the aggregate probability exhibits severaldesirable properties, and is related to independently motivated techniques. Weargue that the market-based approach provides a plausible mechanism for beliefaggregation in multiagent systems, as it directly addresses self-motivatedagent incentives for participation and for truthfulness, and can provide adecision-theoretic foundation for the "expert weights" often employed incentralized pooling techniques.

Characterizing Strategic Cascades on Networks

  Transmission of disease, spread of information and rumors, adoption of newproducts, and many other network phenomena can be fruitfully modeled ascascading processes, where actions chosen by nodes influence the subsequentbehavior of neighbors in the network graph. Current literature on cascadestends to assume nodes choose myopically based on the state of choices alreadytaken by other nodes. We examine the possibility of strategic choice, whereagents representing nodes anticipate the choices of others who have not yetdecided, and take into account their own influence on such choices. Our studyemploys the framework of Chierichetti et al. [2012], who (under assumption ofmyopic node behavior) investigate the scheduling of node decisions to promotecascades of product adoptions preferred by the scheduler. We show that whennodes behave strategically, outcomes can be extremely different. We exhibitcases where in the strategic setting 100% of agents adopt, but in the myopicsetting only an arbitrarily small epsilon % do. Conversely, we present caseswhere in the strategic setting 0% of agents adopt, but in the myopic setting(100-epsilon)% do, for any constant epsilon > 0. Additionally, we prove someproperties of cascade processes with strategic agents, both in general and forparticular classes of graphs.
