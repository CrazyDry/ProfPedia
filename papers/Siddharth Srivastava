Benchmarking KAZE and MCM for Multiclass Classification

  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for feature generation byappropriately fusing KAZE and SIFT features. We then use this feature set alongwith Minimal Complexity Machine(MCM) for object classification. We show thatKAZE and SIFT features are complementary. Experimental results indicate that anelementary integration of these techniques can outperform the state-of-the-artapproaches.

SIFT Vs SURF: Quantifying the Variation in Transformations

  This paper studies the robustness of SIFT and SURF against different imagetransforms (rigid body, similarity, affine and projective) by quantitativelyanalyzing the variations in the extent of transformations. Previous studieshave been comparing the two techniques on absolute transformations rather thanthe specific amount of deformation caused by the transformation. The paperestablishes an exhaustive empirical analysis of such deformations and matchingcapability of SIFT and SURF with variations in matching parameters and theamount of tolerance. This is helpful in choosing the specific use case forapplying these techniques.

Object Classification using Ensemble of Local and Deep Features

  In this paper we propose an ensemble of local and deep features for objectclassification. We also compare and contrast effectiveness of featurerepresentation capability of various layers of convolutional neural network. Wedemonstrate with extensive experiments for object classification that therepresentation capability of features from deep networks can be complementedwith information captured from local features. We also find out that featuresfrom various deep convolutional networks encode distinctive characteristicinformation. We establish that, as opposed to conventional practice,intermediate layers of deep networks can augment the classificationcapabilities of features obtained from fully connected layers.

Enhanced Characterness for Text Detection in the Wild

  Text spotting is an interesting research problem as text may appear at anyrandom place and may occur in various forms. Moreover, ability to detect textopens the horizons for improving many advanced computer vision problems. Inthis paper, we propose a novel language agnostic text detection methodutilizing edge enhanced Maximally Stable Extremal Regions in natural scenes bydefining strong characterness measures. We show that a simple combination ofcharacterness cues help in rejecting the non text regions. These regions arefurther fine-tuned for rejecting the non-textual neighbor regions.Comprehensive evaluation of the proposed scheme shows that it providescomparative to better generalization performance to the traditional methods forthis task.

Large Scale Novel Object Discovery in 3D

  We present a method for discovering never-seen-before objects in 3D pointclouds obtained from sensors like Microsoft Kinect. We generate supervoxelsdirectly from the point cloud data and use them with a Siamese network, builton a recently proposed 3D convolutional neural network architecture. We useknown objects to train a non-linear embedding of supervoxels, by optimizing thecriteria that supervoxels which fall on the same object should be closer thanthose which fall on different objects, in the embedding space. We test onunknown objects, which were not seen during training, and perform clustering inthe learned embedding space of supervoxels to effectively perform novel objectdiscovery. We validate the method with extensive experiments, quantitativelyshowing that it can discover numerous unseen objects while being trained ononly a few dense 3D models. We also show very good qualitative results ofobject discovery in point cloud data when the test objects, either specificinstances or even categories, were never seen during training.

3D Binary Signatures

  In this paper, we propose a novel binary descriptor for 3D point clouds. Theproposed descriptor termed as 3D Binary Signature (3DBS) is motivated from thematching efficiency of the binary descriptors for 2D images. 3DBS describeskeypoints from point clouds with a binary vector resulting in extremely fastmatching. The method uses keypoints from standard keypoint detectors. Thedescriptor is built by constructing a Local Reference Frame and aligning alocal surface patch accordingly. The local surface patch constitutes ofidentifying nearest neighbours based upon an angular constraint among them. Thepoints are ordered with respect to the distance from the keypoints. The normalsof the ordered pairs of these keypoints are projected on the axes and therelative magnitude is used to assign a binary digit. The vector thusconstituted is used as a signature for representing the keypoints. The matchingis done by using hamming distance. We show that 3DBS outperforms state of theart descriptors on various evaluation metrics.

Drought Stress Classification using 3D Plant Models

  Quantification of physiological changes in plants can capture differentdrought mechanisms and assist in selection of tolerant varieties in a highthroughput manner. In this context, an accurate 3D model of plant canopyprovides a reliable representation for drought stress characterization incontrast to using 2D images. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-endpipeline including 3D reconstruction, segmentation and feature extraction,leveraging deep neural networks at various stages, for drought stress study. Toovercome the high degree of self-similarities and self-occlusions in plantcanopy, prior knowledge of leaf shape based on features from deep siamesenetwork are used to construct an accurate 3D model using structure from motionon wheat plants. The drought stress is characterized with a deep network basedfeature aggregation. We compare the proposed methodology on severaldescriptors, and show that the network outperforms conventional methods.

An Anytime Algorithm for Task and Motion MDPs

  Integrated task and motion planning has emerged as a challenging problem insequential decision making, where a robot needs to compute high-level strategyand low-level motion plans for solving complex tasks. While high-levelstrategies require decision making over longer time-horizons and scales, theirfeasibility depends on low-level constraints based upon the geometries andcontinuous dynamics of the environment. The hybrid nature of this problem makesit difficult to scale; most existing approaches focus on deterministic, fullyobservable scenarios. We present a new approach where the high-level decisionproblem occurs in a stochastic setting and can be modeled as a Markov decisionprocess. In contrast to prior efforts, we show that complete MDP policies, orcontingent behaviors, can be computed effectively in an anytime fashion. Ouralgorithm continuously improves the quality of the solution and is guaranteedto be probabilistically complete. We evaluate the performance of our approachon a challenging, realistic test problem: autonomous aircraft inspection. Ourresults show that we can effectively compute consistent task and motionpolicies for the most likely execution-time outcomes using only a fraction ofthe computation required to develop the complete task and motion policy.

DeepPoint3D: Learning Discriminative Local Descriptors using Deep Metric  Learning on 3D Point Clouds

  Learning local descriptors is an important problem in computer vision. Whilethere are many techniques for learning local patch descriptors for 2D images,recently efforts have been made for learning local descriptors for 3D points.The recent progress towards solving this problem in 3D leverages the strongfeature representation capability of image based convolutional neural networksby utilizing RGB-D or multi-view representations. However, in this paper, wepropose to learn 3D local descriptors by directly processing unstructured 3Dpoint clouds without needing any intermediate representation. The methodconstitutes a deep network for learning permutation invariant representation of3D points. To learn the local descriptors, we use a multi-margin contrastiveloss which discriminates between similar and dissimilar points on a surfacewhile also leveraging the extent of dissimilarity among the negative samples atthe time of training. With comprehensive evaluation against strong baselines,we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods formatching points in 3D point clouds. Further, we demonstrate the effectivenessof the proposed method on various applications achieving state-of-the-artresults.

The primaryobjective has been to enhance the way a user interacts with the application bymaking it effortless and convenient. This paper explores the capabilities ofusing Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), an evolving subset of Human ComputerInteraction (HCI) paradigms, to control mobile devices. We present acomprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in this area, discussing thechallenges and limitations in using BCI for mobile applications.

Simulating reachability using first-order logic with applications to  verification of linked data structures

  This paper shows how to harness existing theorem provers for first-orderlogic to automatically verify safety properties of imperative programs thatperform dynamic storage allocation and destructive updating of pointer-valuedstructure fields. One of the main obstacles is specifying and proving the(absence) of reachability properties among dynamically allocated cells.  The main technical contributions are methods for simulating reachability in aconservative way using first-order formulas--the formulas describe a supersetof the set of program states that would be specified if one had a precise wayto express reachability. These methods are employed for semi-automatic programverification (i.e., using programmer-supplied loop invariants) on programs suchas mark-and-sweep garbage collection and destructive reversal of a singlylinked list. (The mark-and-sweep example has been previously reported as beingbeyond the capabilities of ESC/Java.)

On the smoothness of multi-M2 brane horizons

  We calculate the degree of horizon smoothness of multi- $M2$-brane solutionwith branes along a common axis. We find that the metric is generically onlythrice continuously differentiable at any of the horizons. The four-form fieldstrength is found to be only twice continuously differentiable. We work withGaussian null-like co-ordinates which are obtained by solving geodesicequations for multi-$M2$ brane geometry. We also find different, exactco-ordinate transformations which take the metric from isotropic co-ordinatesto co-ordinates in which metric is thrice differentiable at the horizon. Bothmethods give the same result that the multi-$M2$ brane metric is only thricecontinuously differentiable at the horizon.

An ROS-based Shared Communication Middleware for Plug & Play Modular  Intelligent Design of Smart Systems

  Centralized architectures for systems such as smart offices and homes arerapidly becoming obsolete due to inherent inflexibility in their design andmanagement. This is because such systems should not only be easilyre-configurable with the addition of newer capabilities over time but shouldalso have the ability to adapt to multiple points of failure. Fully harnessingthe capabilities of these massively integrated systems requires higher levelreasoning engines that allow them to plan for and achieve diverse long-termgoals, rather than being limited to a few predefined tasks. In this paper, wepropose a set of properties that will accommodate such capabilities, anddevelop a general architecture for integrating automated planning componentsinto smart systems. We show how the reasoning capabilities are embedded in thedesign and operation of the system and demonstrate the same on a real-worldimplementation of a smart office.

Learning Generalized Reactive Policies using Deep Neural Networks

  We present a new approach to learning for planning, where knowledge acquiredwhile solving a given set of planning problems is used to plan faster inrelated, but new problem instances. We show that a deep neural network can beused to learn and represent a \emph{generalized reactive policy} (GRP) thatmaps a problem instance and a state to an action, and that the learned GRPsefficiently solve large classes of challenging problem instances. In contrastto prior efforts in this direction, our approach significantly reduces thedependence of learning on handcrafted domain knowledge or feature selection.Instead, the GRP is trained from scratch using a set of successful executiontraces. We show that our approach can also be used to automatically learn aheuristic function that can be used in directed search algorithms. We evaluateour approach using an extensive suite of experiments on two challengingplanning problem domains and show that our approach facilitates learningcomplex decision making policies and powerful heuristic functions with minimalhuman input. Videos of our results are available at goo.gl/Hpy4e3.

Hierarchical Expertise-Level Modeling for User Specific Robot-Behavior  Explanations

  There is a growing interest within the AI research community to developautonomous systems capable of explaining their behavior to users. One aspect ofthe explanation generation problem that has yet to receive much attention isthe task of explaining plans to users whose level of expertise differ from thatof the explainer. We propose an approach for addressing this problem byrepresenting the user's model as an abstraction of the domain model that theplanner uses. We present algorithms for generating minimal explanations incases where this abstract human model is not known. We reduce the problem ofgenerating explanation to a search over the space of abstract models andinvestigate possible greedy approximations for minimal explanations. We alsoempirically show that our approach can efficiently compute explanations for avariety of problems.

Discrete-Continuous Mixtures in Probabilistic Programming: Generalized  Semantics and Inference Algorithms

  Despite the recent successes of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) inAI applications, PPLs offer only limited support for random variables whosedistributions combine discrete and continuous elements. We develop the notionof measure-theoretic Bayesian networks (MTBNs) and use it to provide moregeneral semantics for PPLs with arbitrarily many random variables defined overarbitrary measure spaces. We develop two new general sampling algorithms thatare provably correct under the MTBN framework: the lexicographic likelihoodweighting (LLW) for general MTBNs and the lexicographic particle filter (LPF),a specialized algorithm for state-space models. We further integrate MTBNs intoa widely used PPL system, BLOG, and verify the effectiveness of the newinference algorithms through representative examples.

Identifying Critical Regions for Motion Planning using Auto-Generated  Saliency Labels with Convolutional Neural Networks

  In this paper, we present a new approach to learning for motion planning (MP)where critical regions of an environment with low probability measure arelearned from a given set of motion plans and used to improve performance on newproblem instances. We show that a convolutional neural network (CNN) can beused to identify critical regions for motion plans. We also introduce a newsampling-based motion planner, Learn and Link (LLP). LLP leverages criticalregion locations identified by our CNN to overcome the limitations of uniformsampling, while still maintaining guarantees of correctness inherent tosampling-based algorithms. We evaluate our planner using an extensive suite ofexperiments on challenging navigation planning problems and compare itsperformance against planners from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL). Weshow that our approach requires the creation of far fewer states than theexisting sampling-based planners.

Why Couldn't You do that? Explaining Unsolvability of Classical Planning  Problems in the Presence of Plan Advice

  Explainable planning is widely accepted as a prerequisite for autonomousagents to successfully work with humans. While there has been a lot of researchon generating explanations of solutions to planning problems, explaining theabsence of solutions remains an open and under-studied problem, even thoughsuch situations can be the hardest to understand or debug. In this paper, weshow that hierarchical abstractions can be used to efficiently generate reasonsfor unsolvability of planning problems. In contrast to related work oncomputing certificates of unsolvability, we show that these methods cangenerate compact, human-understandable reasons for unsolvability. Empiricalanalysis and user studies show the validity of our methods as well as theircomputational efficacy on a number of benchmark planning domains.

A Unified Framework for Planning in Adversarial and Cooperative  Environments

  Users of AI systems may rely upon them to produce plans for achieving desiredobjectives. Such AI systems should be able to compute obfuscated plans whoseexecution in adversarial situations protects privacy, as well as legible planswhich are easy for team members to understand in cooperative situations. Wedevelop a unified framework that addresses these dual problems by computingplans with a desired level of comprehensibility from the point of view of apartially informed observer. For adversarial settings, our approach producesobfuscated plans with observations that are consistent with at least k goalsfrom a set of decoy goals. By slightly varying our framework, we present anapproach for goal legibility in cooperative settings which produces plans thatachieve a goal while being consistent with at most j goals from a set ofconfounding goals. In addition, we show how the observability of the observercan be controlled to either obfuscate or clarify the next actions in a planwhen the goal is known to the observer. We present theoretical results on thecomplexity analysis of our problems. We demonstrate the execution of obfuscatedand legible plans in a cooking domain using a physical robot Fetch. We alsoprovide an empirical evaluation to show the feasibility and usefulness of ourapproaches using IPC domains.
