Multi-photon signal in supersymmetry comprising non-pointing photon(s)  at the LHC

  We study a distinct supersymmetric signal of multi-photons in associationwith jets and missing transverse energy. At least one of these photons has theorigin in displaced vertex, thus delayed and non-pointing. We consider asupersymmetric scenario in which the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetricparticle (LSP) (with a mass $\sim 1~{keV}$) and the lightest neutralino is thenext-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The NLSP decays dominantlyinto a photon and a gravitino within the detector with a decay length rangingfrom $c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}}\sim$ 50-100 cm. In addition, we assume that thesecond lightest neutralino and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerateand this leads to a prompt radiative decay of the next-to-lightest neutralinointo a photon and a lightest neutralino with a large branching ratio. Suchdegenerate neutralinos can be realised in various representations of the$SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, and $E(6)$ Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). The non-pointingphotons can be reconstructed at the electromagnetic calorimeter of the ATLASinner-detector, which have been designed with good timing and directionalresolution. We find that with a centre-of-mass energy $E_{cm}=14 ~{TeV}$ at anintegrated luminosity of 100 $fb^{-1}$ one may see evidence of hundreds oftri-photon events and a few four-photons events at the LHC, in addition toseveral thousands di-photon events. We also predict the event rates even at theearly phase of LHC run.

Minimization of Handoff Failure Probability for Next-Generation Wireless  Systems

  During the past few years, advances in mobile communication theory haveenabled the development and deployment of different wireless technologies,complementary to each other. Hence, their integration can realize a unifiedwireless system that has the best features of the individual networks.Next-Generation Wireless Systems (NGWS) integrate different wireless systems,each of which is optimized for some specific services and coverage area toprovide ubiquitous communications to the mobile users. In this paper, wepropose to enhance the handoff performance of mobile IP in wireless IP networksby reducing the false handoff probability in the NGWS handoff managementprotocol. Based on the information of false handoff probability, we analyze itseffect on mobile speed and handoff signaling delay.

Human-in-the-Loop SLAM

  Building large-scale, globally consistent maps is a challenging problem, mademore difficult in environments with limited access, sparse features, or whenusing data collected by novice users. For such scenarios, wherestate-of-the-art mapping algorithms produce globally inconsistent maps, weintroduce a systematic approach to incorporating sparse human corrections,which we term Human-in-the-Loop Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(HitL-SLAM). Given an initial factor graph for pose graph SLAM, HitL-SLAMaccepts approximate, potentially erroneous, and rank-deficient human input,infers the intended correction via expectation maximization (EM),back-propagates the extracted corrections over the pose graph, and finallyjointly optimizes the factor graph including the human inputs as humancorrection factor terms, to yield globally consistent large-scale maps. We thuscontribute an EM formulation for inferring potentially rank-deficient humancorrections to mapping, and human correction factor extensions to the factorgraphs for pose graph SLAM that result in a principled approach to jointoptimization of the pose graph while simultaneously accounting for multipleforms of human correction. We present empirical results showing theeffectiveness of HitL-SLAM at generating globally accurate and consistent mapseven when given poor initial estimates of the map.

Interactive Robot Transition Repair With SMT

  Complex robot behaviors are often structured as state machines, where statesencapsulate actions and a transition function switches between states. Sincetransitions depend on physical parameters, when the environment changes, aroboticist has to painstakingly readjust the parameters to work in the newenvironment. We present interactive SMT-based Robot Transition Repair (SRTR):instead of manually adjusting parameters, we ask the roboticist to identify afew instances where the robot is in a wrong state and what the right stateshould be. A lightweight automated analysis of the transition function's sourcecode then 1) identifies adjustable parameters, 2) converts the transitionfunction into a system of logical constraints, and 3) formulates theconstraints and user-supplied corrections as MaxSMT problem that yields newparameter values. Our evaluation shows that SRTR is effective on real robotsand in simulation. We show that SRTR finds new parameters 1) quickly, 2) withonly a few corrections, and 3) that the parameters generalize to new scenarios.We also show that a simple state machine corrected by SRTR can out-perform amore complex, expert-tuned state machine in the real world.

Localization under Topological Uncertainty for Lane Identification of  Autonomous Vehicles

  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require accurate metric and topological locationestimates for safe, effective navigation and decision-making. Although manyhigh-definition (HD) roadmaps exist, they are not always accurate since publicroads are dynamic, shaped unpredictably by both human activity and nature.Thus, AVs must be able to handle situations in which the topology specified bythe map does not agree with reality. We present the Variable Structure MultipleHidden Markov Model (VSM-HMM) as a framework for localizing in the presence oftopological uncertainty, and demonstrate its effectiveness on an AV where lanemembership is modeled as a topological localization process. VSM-HMMs use adynamic set of HMMs to simultaneously reason about location within a set ofmost likely current topologies and therefore may also be applied to topologicalstructure estimation as well as AV lane estimation. In addition, we present anextension to the Earth Mover's Distance which allows uncertainty to be takeninto account when computing the distance between belief distributions onsimplices of arbitrary relative sizes.

iVOA: Introspective Vision for Obstacle Avoidance

  Vision, as an inexpensive yet information rich sensor, is commonly used forperception on autonomous mobile robots. Unfortunately, accurate vision-basedperception requires a number of assumptions about the environment to hold --some examples of such assumptions, depending on the perception algorithm athand, include purely lambertian surfaces, texture-rich scenes, absence ofaliasing features, and refractive surfaces. In this paper, we present anapproach for introspective vision for obstacle avoidance (iVOA) -- byleveraging a supervisory sensor that is occasionally available, we detectfailures of stereo vision-based perception from divergence in plans generatedby vision and the supervisory sensor. By projecting the 3D coordinates wherethe plans agree and disagree onto the images used for vision-based perception,iVOA generates a training set of reliable and unreliable image patches forperception. We then use this training dataset to learn a model of which imagepatches are likely to cause failures of the vision-based perception algorithm.Using this model, iVOA is then able to predict whether the relevant imagepatches in the observed images are likely to cause failures due to vision (bothfalse positives and false negatives). We empirically demonstrate with extensivereal-world data from both indoor and outdoor environments, the ability of iVOAto accurately predict the failures of two distinct vision algorithms.

Minimization of Handoff latency by co-ordinate evaluation method using  GPS based map

  Handoff has become an essential criterion in mobile communication system,specially in urban areas, owing to the limited coverage area of Access Points(AP). Handover of calls between two Base Stations (BSs) is encounteredfrequently and it is essentially required to minimize the delay of the process.Many solutions attempting to improve this process have been proposed but only afew use geo-location systems in the management of the handover. Here we proposeto minimize the handoff latency by minimizing the number of APs scanned by theMobile Node (MN) during each handoff procedure. We consider the wholetopographical area as a two dimensional plane. By GPS, we can note down theco-ordinates of the MN at any instant. The average rate of change of itslatitudinal distance and longitudinal distance with a specific time period isevaluated at the end of the given time period. With the knowledge of the givenparameter, it is possible to determine the latitude and longitude of the MNafter a particular instant of time. Hence, the direction of motion of the MNcan be determined, which in turns gives the AP towards which the MN isheadings. This reduces the number of APs to be scanned. Thus, on an overallbasis, the handoff latency can be reduced by almost half to one third of itsvalue.

A Real-Time Solver For Time-Optimal Control Of Omnidirectional Robots  with Bounded Acceleration

  We are interested in the problem of time-optimal control of omnidirectionalrobots with bounded acceleration (TOC-ORBA). While there exist approximatesolutions for such robots, and exact solutions with unbounded acceleration,exact solvers to the TOC-ORBA problem have remained elusive until now. In thispaper, we present a real-time solver for true time-optimal control ofomnidirectional robots with bounded acceleration. We first derive the generalparameterized form of the solution to the TOC-ORBA problem by application ofPontryagin's maximum principle. We then frame the boundary value problem ofTOC-ORBA as an optimization problem over the parametrized control space. Toovercome local minima and poor initial guesses to the optimization problem, weintroduce a two-stage optimal control solver (TSOCS): The first stage computesan upper bound to the total time for the TOC-ORBA problem and holds the timeconstant while optimizing the parameters of the trajectory to approach theboundary value conditions. The second stage uses the parameters found by thefirst stage, and relaxes the constraint on the total time to solve for theparameters of the complete TOC-ORBA problem. We further implement TSOCS as aclosed loop controller to overcome actuation errors on real robots inreal-time. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of TSOCS in simulationand on real robots, showing that 1) it runs in real time, generating solutionsin less than 0.5ms on average; 2) it generates faster trajectories compared toan approximate solver; and 3) it is able to solve TOC-ORBA problems withnon-zero final velocities that were previously unsolvable in real-time.

X*: Anytime Multiagent Planning With Bounded Search

  Multi-agent planning in dynamic domains is a challenging problem: the size ofthe configuration space increases exponentially in the number of agents, andplans need to be re-evaluated periodically to account for moving obstacles.However, we have two key insights that hold in several domains: 1) conflictsbetween multi-agent plans often have geometrically local resolutions within asmall repair window, even if such local resolutions are not globally optimal;and 2) the partial search tree for such local resolutions can then beiteratively improved over successively larger windows to eventually compute theglobal optimal plan. Building upon these two insights, we introduce a sparse,anytime variant of the A* planner, which we call X* (Expanding A*). X* operatesby planning for each agent individually and forming local repair windows aroundcollisions, repairing agents within that window. If time allows, X* grows thewindow and repeats. X* implements two novel techniques to reduce thecomputational cost compared to joint A*: 1) it preserves the partial X* searchtrees and priority queues between iterations of window growth; and 2) it defersexplicit joint state enumeration until necessary. By preserving the searchtree, X* significantly out-performs joint A* and a na\"ive window-growing A*algorithm. By deferring explicit joint state enumeration, X* reduces the numberof priority queue operations by several orders of magnitude compared to a jointA* planner. We present empirical results from several domains, showing that X*outperforms existing state-of-the-art joint planners for sparse anytimemulti-agent planning with optimality convergence.
