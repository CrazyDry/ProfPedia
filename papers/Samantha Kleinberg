Investigating Causal Relationships in Stock Returns with Temporal Logic  Based Methods

  We describe a new framework for causal inference and its application toreturn time series. In this system, causal relationships are represented aslogical formulas, allowing us to test arbitrarily complex hypotheses in acomputationally efficient way. We simulate return time series using a commonfactor model, and show that on this data the method described significantlyoutperforms Granger causality (a primary approach to this type of problem).Finally we apply the method to real return data, showing that the method candiscover novel relationships between stocks. The approach described is ageneral one that will allow combination of price and volume data withqualitative information at varying time scales (from interest rateannouncements, to earnings reports to news stories) shedding light on some ofthe previously invisible common causes of seemingly correlated price movements.

The Temporal Logic of Causal Structures

  Computational analysis of time-course data with an underlying causalstructure is needed in a variety of domains, including neural spike trains,stock price movements, and gene expression levels. However, it can bechallenging to determine from just the numerical time course data alone what iscoordinating the visible processes, to separate the underlying prima faciecauses into genuine and spurious causes and to do so with a feasiblecomputational complexity. For this purpose, we have been developing a novelalgorithm based on a framework that combines notions of causality in philosophywith algorithmic approaches built on model checking and statistical techniquesfor multiple hypotheses testing. The causal relationships are described interms of temporal logic formulae, reframing the inference problem in terms ofmodel checking. The logic used, PCTL, allows description of both the timebetween cause and effect and the probability of this relationship beingobserved. We show that equipped with these causal formulae with theirassociated probabilities we may compute the average impact a cause makes to itseffect and then discover statistically significant causes through the conceptsof multiple hypothesis testing (treating each causal relationship as ahypothesis), and false discovery control. By exploring a well-chosen family ofpotentially all significant hypotheses with reasonably minimal descriptionlength, it is possible to tame the algorithm's computational complexity whileexploring the nearly complete search-space of all prima facie causes. We havetested these ideas in a number of domains and illustrate them here with twoexamples.

Proceedings 3rd Workshop on formal reasoning about Causation,  Responsibility, and Explanations in Science and Technology

  The CREST 2018 workshop is the third in a series of workshops addressingformal approaches to reasoning about causation in systems engineering. Thetopic of formally identifying the cause(s) of specific events - usually someform of failures -, and explaining why they occurred, are increasingly in thefocus of several, disjoint communities. The main objective of CREST is to bringtogether researchers and practitioners from industry and academia in order toenable discussions how explicit and implicit reasoning about causation isperformed. A further objective is to link to the foundations of causalreasoning in the philosophy of sciences and to causal reasoning performed inother areas of computer science, engineering, and beyond.
