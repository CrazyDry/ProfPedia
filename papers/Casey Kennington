Symbol, Conversational, and Societal Grounding with a Toy Robot

  Essential to meaningful interaction is grounding at the symbolic,conversational, and societal levels. We present ongoing work with Anki's Cozmotoy robot as a research platform where we leverage the recentwords-as-classifiers model of lexical semantics in interactive referenceresolution tasks for language grounding.

Resolving References to Objects in Photographs using the  Words-As-Classifiers Model

  A common use of language is to refer to visually present objects. Modellingit in computers requires modelling the link between language and perception.The "words as classifiers" model of grounded semantics views words asclassifiers of perceptual contexts, and composes the meaning of a phrasethrough composition of the denotations of its component words. It was recentlyshown to perform well in a game-playing scenario with a small number of objecttypes. We apply it to two large sets of real-world photographs that contain amuch larger variety of types and for which referring expressions are available.Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract image features, andaugmenting these with in-picture positional information, we show that the modelachieves performance competitive with the state of the art in a referenceresolution task (given expression, find bounding box of its referent), while,as we argue, being conceptually simpler and more flexible.
