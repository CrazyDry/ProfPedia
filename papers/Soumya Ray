Identifying Galactic PeVatrons with Neutrinos

  We perform a realistic evaluation of the potential of IceCube, akilometer-scale neutrino detector under construction at the South Pole, todetect neutrinos in the direction of the potential accelerators of the Galacticcosmic rays. We take fully account of the fact that the measurement of theenergy of the secondary muons can be used to further discriminate between thesignal and the background of atmospheric neutrinos. We conclude that IceCubecould identify the sources in the Milagro sky map as the sources of theGalactic cosmic rays at the 3 sigma level in one year and at the 5 sigma levelin three years. We discuss the dependence of these expectations on ambiguities,mostly associated with our incomplete knowledge of the astrophysics of thesources.

130 GeV Gamma Ray Signal in NMSSM by Internal Bremsstrahlung

  There is a possible \gamma-ray signal at 130 GeV coming from the GalacticCenter as seen by Fermi-LAT experiment. We give a SUSY dark matter model toexplain this \gamma-ray feature in NMSSM. We show that in NMSSM, one can have abenchmark set in which the \gamma-ray signal arises from final state \gamma'sin the $\chi\chi \to f \bar f \gamma $ annihilation of a 130 GeV bino darkmatter requiring a boost factor of ~590 to fit the \gamma-ray signal. Inaddition, this benchmark set also gives the correct relic density, lightestHiggs mass of 125 GeV and is consistent with constraints on SUSY from LHC. Thisdark matter model evades the XENON100 constraint but is testable in a futureXENON1T experiment.

Relic density and PAMELA events in a heavy wino dark matter model with  Sommerfeld effect

  In a wino LSP scenario the annihilation cross section of winosgravitationally bound in galaxies can be boosted by a Sommerfeld enhancementfactor which arises due to the ladder of exchanged W bosons between the initialstates. The boost factor obtained can be in the range S ~ 10^4 if the mass isclose to the resonance value of M ~ 4 TeV. In this paper we show that if onetakes into account the Sommerfeld enhancement in the relic abundancecalculation then the correct relic density is obtained for 4 TeV wino mass dueto the enhanced annihilation after their kinetic decoupling. At the same timethe Sommerfeld enhancement in the \chi \chi --> W^+ W^- annihilation channel issufficient to explain the positron flux seen in PAMELA data withoutsignificantly exceeding the observed antiproton signal. We also show that (e^-+ e^+) and gamma ray signals are broadly compatible with the Fermi-LATobservations. In conclusion we show that a 4 TeV wino DM can explain thepositron and antiproton fluxes observed by PAMELA and at the same time give athermal relic abundance of CDM consistent with WMAP observations.

Constraints on Born-Infeld gravity from the speed of gravitational waves  after GW170817 and GRB 170817A

  The observations of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star mergerevent GW170817 and the subsequent observation of its electromagneticcounterparts from the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A provide us a significantopportunity to study theories of gravity beyond general relativity. Animportant outcome of these observations is that they constrain the differencebetween the speed of gravity and the speed of light to less than $10^{-15}c$.Also, the time delay between the arrivals of gravitational waves at differentdetectors constrains the speed of gravity at the Earth to be in the range$0.55c < v_{gw} < 1.42c$. We use these results to constrain a widely studiedmodified theory of gravity: Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. Weshow that, in EiBI theory, the speed of gravitational waves in matter deviatesfrom $c$. From the time delay in arrival of gravitational wave signals atEarth-based detectors, we obtain the bound on the theory parameter $\kappa$ as$\vert\kappa\vert \lesssim 10^{21}\, m^2$. Similarly, from the time delaybetween the signals of GW170817 and GRB 170817A, in a backgroundFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, we obtain $\vert \kappa \vert \lesssim10^{37}\, m^2$. Although the bounds on $\kappa$ are weak compared to otherearlier bounds from the study of neutron stars, stellar evolution, primordialnucleosynthesis, etc., our bounds are from the direct observations and thusworth noting.

Electron Capture Rates of Mid-fp Shell Nuclei for Supernova and Stellar  Evolution

  A detailed model is constructed for the calculation of electron capture ratesof some fp-shell nuclei for situations prevailing in pre-supernova and collapsephases of the evolution of the core of massive stars leading to supernovaexplosion. The model uses explicitly the Gamow-Teller strength functionobtained through (n,p) reaction studies wherever available. The rates includecontribution from the excited states of the mother as well as from the resonantstates in equilibrium with the back reaction i.e. the beta decay of thedaughter nucleus. Comparisons are made with the shell model results and theearlier calculations by Aufderheide et al. and Fuller, Fowler and Newman. Forthe nuclei $^{56}$Fe, $^{55}$Mn and $^{60}$Ni with negative Q-values oneobserves large contribution from the excited states.

Detecting an association between Gamma Ray and Gravitational Wave Bursts

  If $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) are accompanied by gravitational wave bursts(GWBs) the correlated output of two gravitational wave detectors evaluated inthe moments just prior to a GRB will differ from that evaluated at times notassociated with a GRB. We can test for this difference independently of anymodel of the GWB signal waveform. If we invoke a model for the GRB sourcepopulation and GWB radiation spectral density we can find a confidence intervalor upper limit on the root-mean-square GWB signal amplitude in the detectorwaveband. To illustrate we adopt a simple, physically motivated model andestimate that initial LIGO detector observations coincident with 1000 GRBscould lead us to exclude, with 95% confidence, associated GWBs with $h_{RMS}\gtrsim 1.7 \times 10^{-22}$. This result does not require the detector noisebe Gaussian or that any inter-detector correlated noise be measured ormeasurable; it does not require advanced or a priori knowledge of the sourcewaveform; and the limits obtained on the wave-strength improve with the numberof observed GRBs.

Learning Bayesian Network Structure from Correlation-Immune Data

  Searching the complete space of possible Bayesian networks is intractable forproblems of interesting size, so Bayesian network structure learningalgorithms, such as the commonly used Sparse Candidate algorithm, employheuristics. However, these heuristics also restrict the types of relationshipsthat can be learned exclusively from data. They are unable to learnrelationships that exhibit "correlation-immunity", such as parity. To learnBayesian networks in the presence of correlation-immune relationships, weextend the Sparse Candidate algorithm with a technique called "skewing". Thistechnique uses the observation that relationships that are correlation-immuneunder a specific input distribution may not be correlation-immune underanother, sufficiently different distribution. We show that by extending SparseCandidate with this technique we are able to discover relationships betweenrandom variables that are approximately correlation-immune, with asignificantly lower computational cost than the alternative of consideringmultiple parents of a node at a time.

Proposed method for searches of gravitational waves from PKS 2155-304  and other blazar flares

  We propose to search for gravitational waves from PKS 2155-304 as well asother blazars. PKS 2155-304 emitted a long duration energetic flare in July2006, with total isotropic equivalent energy released in TeV gamma rays ofapproximately $10^{45}$ ergs. Any possible gravitational wave signalsassociated with this outburst should be seen by gravitational wave detectors atthe same time as the electromagnetic signal. During this flare, the two LIGOinterferometers at Hanford and the GEO detector were in operation andcollecting data. For this search we will use the data from multiplegravitational wave detectors. The method we use for this purpose is a coherentnetwork analysis algorithm and is called {\tt RIDGE}. To estimate thesensitivity of the search, we perform numerical simulations. The sensitivity toestimated gravitational wave energy at the source is about $2.5 \times 10^{55}$ergs for a detection probability of 20%. For this search, an end-to-endanalysis pipeline has been developed, which takes into account the motion ofthe source across the sky.

Colloidal graphite/graphene nanostructures using collagen showing  enhanced thermal conductivity

  Time kinetics of interaction of natural graphite (GR) to colloidal graphene(G) collagen (C) nanocomposites was studied at ambient conditions, and observedthat just one day at ambient conditions is enough to form colloidal graphenedirectly from graphite using the protein collagen. Neither controlledtemperature and pressure ambiance nor sonication was needed for the same;thereby rendering the process biomimetic. Detailed spectroscopy, X raydiffraction, electron microscopy as well as fluorescence and luminescenceassisted characterization of the colloidal dispersions on day one and day sevenreveals graphene and collagen interaction and subsequent rearrangement to forman open structure. Detailed confocal microscopy, in the liquid state, revealsthe initial attack at the zigzag edges of GR, the enhancement of autofluorescence and finally the opening up of graphitic stacks of GR to form neartransparent G. Atomic Force Microscopy studies prove the existence of bothcollagen and graphene and the disruption of periodicity at the atomic level.Thermal conductivity of the colloid shows a 17% enhancement for a volumefraction of less than 0.00005 of G. Time variant increase in thermalconductivity provides qualitative evidence for the transient exfoliation of GRto G. The composite reveals interesting properties that could propel it as afuture material for advanced bio applications including therapeutics.

Particle Production in Ultra-Strong Coupling Waveguide QED

  Understanding large-scale interacting quantum matter requires dealing withthe huge number of quanta that are produced by scattering even a few particlesagainst a complex quantum object. Prominent examples are found from high energycosmic ray showers to the optical or electrical driving of degenerate Fermigases. We tackle this challenge in the context of many-body quantum optics, asmotivated by the recent developments of circuit quantum electrodynamics atultrastrong coupling. The issue of particle production is addressedquantitatively with a simple yet powerful concept rooted in the quantumsuperposition principle. This key idea is illustrated by the study ofmulti-photon emission from a single two-level artificial atom coupled to a highimpedance waveguide. We find surprisingly that the off-resonant inelasticemission lineshape is dominated by broadband particle production, due to thelarge phase space associated with contributions that do not conserve the numberof excitations. Such frequency conversion processes produce striking signaturesin time correlation measurements, which can be tested experimentally in quantumwaveguides. These ideas open new directions for the simulation of a variety ofphysical systems, from polaron dynamics in solids to complex superconductingquantum architectures.

Mission to the Trojan Asteroids: lessons learned during a JPL Planetary  Science Summer School mission design exercise

  The 2013 Planetary Science Decadal Survey identified a detailed investigationof the Trojan asteroids occupying Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points as apriority for future NASA missions. Observing these asteroids and measuringtheir physical characteristics and composition would aid in identification oftheir source and provide answers about their likely impact history andevolution, thus yielding information about the makeup and dynamics of the earlySolar System. We present a conceptual design for a mission to the Jovian Trojanasteroids: the Trojan ASteroid Tour, Exploration, and Rendezvous (TASTER)mission, that is consistent with the NASA New Frontiers candidate missionrecommended by the Decadal Survey and the final result of the 2011 NASA-JPLPlanetary Science Summer School. Our proposed mission includes visits to twoTrojans in the L4 population: a 500 km altitude fly-by of 1999 XS143, followedby a rendezvous with and detailed observations of 911 Agamemnon at orbitalaltitudes of 1000 - 100 km over a 12 month nominal science data capture period.Our proposed instrument payload - wide- and narrow-angle cameras, a visual andinfrared mapping spectrometer, and a neutron/gamma ray spectrometer - wouldprovide unprecedented high-resolution, regional-to-global datasets for thetarget bodies, yielding fundamental information about the early history andevolution of the Solar System. Although our mission design was completed aspart of an academic exercise, this study serves as a useful starting point forfuture Trojan mission design studies. In particular, we identify and discusskey issues that can make large differences in the complex trade-offs requiredwhen designing a mission to the Trojan asteroids.
