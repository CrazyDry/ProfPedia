Determining the order of SU(3) deconfining phase transition

  An effective spin model for the finite temperature non-abelian lattice gaugetheory is derived. The outcome is the surprising result that only nearestneighbor coupling survives, thus confirming the well known numerical resultsthat the deconfining phase transition of the (3+1)-dimensional $SU(3)$ puregauge theory is first order.

  In this paper, we give a new version of the modified Futaki invariant for atest configuration associated to the soliton action on a Fano manifold. Ourversion will naturally come from toric test configurations defined by Donaldsonfor toric manifolds. As an application, we show that the modified $K$-energy isproper for toric invariant K\"ahler potentials on a toric Fano manifold.

General Monogamy Relation between Information-Theoretic Contextuality  Inequalities

  We show that the perfect commutation graph is the sufficient tight conditionfor admitting the noncontextual description of each observable set satisfyingit in the yes-no question scenario. With this condition, we propose a methodfor proving the monogamy relation between two informationtheoreticcontextuality inequalities by decomposing the total commutation graph intoperfect subgraphs. The results offer a powerful tool to investigate thecontextuality and to understand quantum information theory. This theoreticalwork can be experimentally verified in current laboratorial technology.

  In this paper, we report an experiment about the device-independent tests ofclassical and quantum entropy based on a recent proposal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,110501 (2015)], in which the states are encoded on the polarization of abiphoton system and measured by the state tomography technology. We alsotheoretically obtained the minimal quantum entropy for three widely used lineardimension witnesses. The experimental results agree well with the theoreticalanalysis, demonstrating that lower entropy is needed in quantum systems thanthat in classical systems under given values of the dimension witness.

A note on the proof of magnetic flux quantization from ODLRO

  It is noticed that the excellent proof of the connection of magnetic fluxquantization and off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO) presented recently byNieh, Su and Zhao suffers from an imperfection, namely, the f-factors in thecase of finite translation do not satisfy $f(a)f(b)=f(a+b)$, which was employedin the proof. A corrected proof is proposed to remedy this point.

Induced Parity-Breaking Term at Finite Chemical Potential and  Temparature

  We exactly calculated the parity-odd term of the effective action induced bythe fermions in 2+1 dimensions at finite chemical potential and finitetemperature. It shows that gauge invariance is still respected. A more gerneralclass of background configurations is considered. The knowledge of the reduced1+1 determinant is required in order to draw exact conclusions about the gaugeinvariance of the parity-odd term in this latter case.

Quantum computing by pairing trapped ultracold ions

  The superpositional wave function oscillations for finite-time implementationof quantum algorithms modifies the desired interference required for quantumcomputing. We propose a scheme with trapped ultracold ion-pairs being qubits todiminish the detrimental effect of the wave function oscillations, and applythe scheme to the two-qubit Grover's search. It can be also found that thequbits in our scheme are more robust against the decoherence caused by theenvironment, and the model is scalable.

Switchable metamaterial reflector/absorber for different polarized  electromagnetic waves

  We demonstrate a controllable electromagnetic wave reflector/absorber fordifferent polarizations with metamaterial involving electromagnetic resonantstructures coupled with diodes. Through biasing at different voltages to turnON and OFF the diodes, we are able to switch the structure between nearly totalreflection and total absorption of a particularly polarized incident wave. Byarranging orthogonally orientated resonant cells, the metamaterial can react todifferent polarized waves by selectively biasing the corresponding diodes. Bothnumerical simulations and microwave measurements have verified the performance.

Theresults show that it is feasible to adopt 9-cell Tesla cavity for compact ERLtest facilities with just a few cavities and beam current around tens mA.

General soliton solutions to a coupled Fokas-Lenells equation

  In this paper, we firstly establish the multi-Hamiltonian structure andinfinite many conservation laws for the vector Kaup-Newell hierarchy of thepositive and negative orders. The first nontrivial negative flow corresponds toa coupled Fokas-Lenells equation. By constructing a generalized Darbouxtransformation and using a limiting process, all kinds of one-soliton solutionsare constructed including the bright-dark soliton, the dark-anti-dark solitonand the breather-like solutions. Furthermore, multi-bright and multi-darksoliton solutions are derived and their asymptotic behaviors are investigated.

  Song \cite{Song10} proposed very recently a password-based authentication andkey establishment protocol using smart cards which attempts to solve someweaknesses found in a previous scheme suggested by Xu, Zhu, and Feng\cite{XZF09}. In this paper, we present attacks on the improved protocol,showing that it fails to achieve the claimed security goals.

A volume stability theorem on toric manifolds with positive Ricci  curvature

  In this short note, we will prove a volume stability theorem which says thatif an n-dimensional toric manifold $M$ admits a $\mathbb{T}^n$ invariantK\"ahler metric $\omega$ with Ricci curvature no less than 1 and its volume isclose to the volume of $\mathbb{CP}^n$, $M$ is bi-holomorphic to$\mathbb{CP}^n$.

A New visita to the SU(N) gauge field confinement

  Based on our exact effective spin model, the zero temperature $SU(N)$ gaugefield confinement has been studied by the deconfinement-confinement phasetransition order parameter, i.e. the Wilson line, rather than the quarkantiquark potential. The procedure would allow one to study the confinement inthe true continuum limit. For the $(1+1)$ $SU(2)$ gauge field, the confinementand a linear zero temperature Polyakov quark antiquark potential were shown. Itis also shown, for the first time, that the Polyakov and Wilson potentials areidentical.

Low Transverse Momentum Heavy Quark Pair Production to Probe Gluon  Tomography

  We derive the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization for heavyquark pair production in deep inelastic scattering, where the total transversemomentum is much smaller than the invariant mass of the pair. The factorizationis demonstrated at one-loop order, in both Ji-Ma-Yuan and Collins-11 schemesfor the TMD definitions, and the hard factors are calculated accordingly. Ourresult provides a solid theoretical foundation for the phenomenologicalinvestigations of the gluon TMDs in this process, and can be extended to othersimilar hard processes, including dijet (di-hadron) production in DIS.

Asymptotic Composite Estimation

  Composition methodologies in the current literature are mainly to promoteestimation efficiency via direct composition, either, of initial estimators orof objective functions. In this paper, composite estimation is investigated forboth estimation efficiency and bias reduction. To this end, a novel method isproposed by utilizing a regression relationship between initial estimators andvalues of model-independent parameter in an asymptotic sense. The resultingestimators could have smaller limiting variances than those of initialestimators, and for nonparametric regression estimation, could also have fasterconvergence rate than the classical optimal rate that the corresponding initialestimators can achieve. The simulations are carried out to examine itsperformance in finite sample situations.

Real-time dual frequency comb spectroscopy in the near infrared

  We use two femtosecond Erbium-doped fiber lasers with slightly differentrepetition rates to perform a modern type of Fourier transform spectroscopywithout moving parts. The measurements are done in real time, and it takes lessthan 50 microseconds. We work with somewhat different spectral outputs from twoErbium-doped fiber lasers and employ spectral filtering based on a 2f-2fgrating setup to select the common spectral region of interest, therebyincreasing the signal-to-noise ratio. The interferogram is taken with a 20 cmlong gas cell, containing a mixture of acetylene and air at atmosphericpressure, and is fast-Fourier-transformed to obtain the broadband spectralfingerprint of the gas.

High-power mid-infrared frequency comb source based on a femtosecond  Er:fiber oscillator

  We report on a high-power mid-infrared frequency comb source based on afemtosecond Er:fiber oscillator with a stabilized repetition rate at 250 MHz.The mid-infrared frequency comb is produced through difference frequencygeneration in a periodically poled MgO-doped lithium niobate crystal. Theoutput power is about 120 mW with a pulse duration of about 80 fs, and spectrumcoverage from 2.9 to 3.6 um. The coherence properties of the producedhigh-power broadband mid-infrared frequency comb are maintained, which wasverified by heterodyne measurements. As the first application, the spectrum ofa ~200 ppm methane-air mixture in a short 20 cm glass cell at ambientatmospheric pressure and temperature was measured.

Tailoring exciton dynamics by elastic strain-gradient in semiconductors

  As device miniaturization approaches the atomic limit, it becomes highlydesirable to exploit novel paradigms for tailoring electronic structures andcarrier dynamics in materials. Elastic strain can in principle be applied toachieve reversible and fast control of such properties, but it remains a greatchallenge to create and utilize precisely controlled inhomogeneous deformationin semiconductors. Here, we take a combined experimental and theoreticalapproach to demonstrate that elastic strain-gradient can be createdcontrollably and reversibly in ZnO micro/nanowires. In particular, we show thatthe inhomogeneous strain distribution creates an effective field thatfundamentally alters the dynamics of the neutral excitons. As the basicprinciples behind these results are quite generic and applicable to mostsemiconductors, this work points to a novel route to a wide range ofapplications in electronics, optoelectronics, and photochemistry.

Single Photon Source Driver Designed in ASIC

  The single photon source is an important part of the quantum key distribution(QKD) system. At present, the single photon source is large in size and complexin structure for a lot of discrete components which are used. Theminiaturization of the photon source is the tendency of the QKD system. Weintegrate all laser driver electronic module into one single ASIC chip, whichcan be used to drive the 1550nm DFB laser in random pulse mode and it cangreatly reduce the volume of the single photon source. We present the design ofthe chip named LSD2018 and simulation results before the tape-out. The LSD2018is fabricated with a 130 nm CMOS process and consists of a discriminator, anadjustable pulse generator, a bandgap reference, an SPI bus, and anamplitude-adjustable current pulse driver. The electronic random pulse from thedriver can go 20mA to 120mA in amplitude and 400ps to 4ns in pulse width. Theparameters can be set by an SPI bus.

Creation, manipulation and detection of Majorana fermions with cold  atoms in optical lattice

  We propose an experimental scheme to simulate the transverse field Isingmodel with cold atoms trapped in one-dimensional optical lattice. Majoranafermions are created at the ends of the optical lattice segment in topologicalphase. By controlling the addressing lasers, one can move, fuse and braid them.We also show that the non-Abelian braiding statistics of Majorana fermions canbe demonstrated unambiguously through the construction of two braidingoperations and distinguishing the resulting two output orthogonal collectivespin states. A nice feature of the scheme is that the strong fluorescenceprovided by the collective spin state can be readily detected in experiment.

Shear-Exfoliated Phosphorene for Rechargeable Nanoscale Battery

  Discovery of atomically thin black phosphorus (called phosphorene) holdspromise to be used as an alternative two-dimensional material to graphene andtransition metal dichalcogenides especially as an anode material forlithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, at present bulk black phosphorus (BP)still suffers from rapid capacity fading that results in poor rechargeableperformance. Here, for the first time, we use in situ transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) to construct nanoscale phosphorene LIBs and visualize thecapacity fading mechanism in thick multilayer phosphorene by real timecapturing delithiation-induced structural decomposition that reduces electricalconductivity and thus causes irreversibility of lithiated Li3P phase. Wefurther demonstrate that few-layer phosphorene successfully circumvents thestructural decomposition and holds superior structural restorability, evensubjected to multi-cycle lithiation/delithiation processes and concomitant hugevolume expansion. This finding affords new experimental insights intothickness-dependent lithium diffusion kinetics in phosphorene. Additionally, ascalable liquid-phase shear exfoliation route has been developed to producehigh-quality ultrathin (monolayer or few-layer) phosphorene, only by ahigh-speed shear mixer or even a household kitchen blender with the shear ratethreshold, which will pave the way for potential large-scale applications inLIBs once the rechargeable phosphorene nanoscale batteries can be transferredto industrialized enlargement in the future.

Breaking the energy-symmetry blockade in magneto-optical rotation

  The magneto-optical polarization rotation effect has prolific applications invarious research areas spanning the scientific spectrum including space andinterstellar research, nano-technology and material science, biomedicalimaging, and sub-atomic particle research. In nonlinear magneto-opticalrotation (NMOR), the intensity of a linearly-polarized probe field affects therotation of its own polarization plane while propagating in a magnetizedmedium. However, typical NMOR signals of conventional single-beam$\Lambda-$scheme atomic magnetometers are peculiarly small, requiringsophisticated magnetic shielding under complex operational conditions. Here, weshow the presence of an energy-symmetry blockade that undermines the NMOReffect in conventional single-beam $\Lambda-$scheme atomic magnetometers. Wefurther demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, an inelasticwave-mixing technique that breaks this NMOR blockade, resulting in more thanfive orders of magnitude ($>$300,000-fold) NMOR optical signal power spectraldensity enhancement never before seen with conventional single-beam$\Lambda-$scheme atomic magnetometers. This new technique, demonstrated withsubstantially reduced light intensities, may lead to many applications,especially in the field of bio-magnetism and high-resolution low-field magneticimaging.

Experimental Implementaton of Dense Coding Using Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance

  Quantum dense coding has been demonstrated experimentally in terms of quantumlogic gates and circuits in quantum computation and NMR technique. Two bits ofinformation have been transmitted through manipulating one of the maximallyentangled two-state quantum pair, which is completely consistent with theoriginal ideal of Bennett-Wiesner proposal. Although information transmissionhappens between spins over inter-atomic distance, the scheme of entanglementtransformation and measurement can be used in other processes of quantuminformation and quantum computing.

Experimental realization of a highly structured search algorithm

  The highly structured search algorithm proposed by Hogg[Phys.Rev.Lett.80,2473(1998)] is implemented experimentally for the 1-SAT problem in a singlesearch step by using nuclear magnetic resonance technique with two-qubitsample. It is the first demonstration of the Hogg's algorithm, and can bereadily extended to solving 1-SAT problem for more qubits in one step if theappropriate samples possessing more qubits are experimentally feasible.

Experimental Implementation of Hogg's Algorithm on a Three-Quantum-bit  NMR Quantum Computer

  Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques with three-qubit sample, wehave experimentally implemented the highly structured algorithm for the 1-SATproblem proposed by Hogg. A simplified temporal averaging procedure wasemployed to the three-qubit spin pseudo-pure state. The algorithm was completedwith only a single evaluation of structure of the problem and the solutionswere found with probability 100%, which outperform both unstructured quantumand the best classical search algorithm.

A scheme for generating entangled cluster state of atomic ensembles

  It was shown in Ref.[Phys.Rev.A 77,045802(2008)] that the dynamics of acontrol atom and an atomic sample interacting dispersively with a cavity can bediscribed by the Jaynes-Cummings model and the collective mode of the atomicsample can be analogous with a bosonic mode. Here, by analogizing the behaviourof the atomic sample with the one of the cavity, we propose a scheme togenerate cluster states of atomic ensembles by Cavity QED.

  Sorting a Permutation by Transpositions (SPbT) is an important problem inBioinformtics. In this paper, we improve the running time of the best knownapproximation algorithm for SPbT. We use the permutation tree data structure ofFeng and Zhu and improve the running time of the 1.375 Approximation Algorithmfor SPbT of Elias and Hartman to $O(n\log n)$. The previous running time of EHalgorithm was $O(n^2)$.

Modelling Clock Synchronization in the Chess gMAC WSN Protocol

  We present a detailled timed automata model of the clock synchronizationalgorithm that is currently being used in a wireless sensor network (WSN) thathas been developed by the Dutch company Chess. Using the Uppaal model checker,we establish that in certain cases a static, fully synchronized network mayeventually become unsynchronized if the current algorithm is used, even in asetting with infinitesimal clock drifts.

Discussion for the Solutions of Dyson-Schwinger Equations at m>0 in QED3

  In the case of nonzero fermion mass, within a range of Ansatze for the fullfermion-boson vertex, we show that Dyson-Schwinger equation for the fermionpropagator in QED3 has two qualitatively distinct dynamical chiral symmetrybreaking solutions. As the fermion mass increases and reaches to a criticalvalue mc, one solution disappears, and the dependence of mc on the number offermion flavors is also given.

Mutual ionization in atomic collisions near the electronic threshold

  We study mutual ionization in collisions between atomic hydrogen and heliumat impact velocities near the electronic threshold for this process (determinedby the condition that kinetic energy of an equivelocity free electron isapproximately equal to the sum of binding energies of active electrons in theprojectile and target). We show that this process is substantially influencedby the Coulomb repulsion between the emitted electrons and that the atomicnuclei are very strongly involved in the momentum balance along the collisionvelocity.

  One superconducting taper-type half-wave resonator (HWR) with frequency of162.5MHz, \b{eta} of 0.09 has been developed at Peking University, which isused to accelerate high current proton ($\sim$ 100mA) and $D^{+}$($\sim$ 50mA).The radio frequency (RF) design of the cavity has been accomplished. Herein, wepresent the mechanical analysis of the cavity which is also an important aspectin superconducting cavity design. The frequency shift caused by bath heliumpressure and Lorenz force, and the tuning by deforming the cavity along thebeam axis will be analyzed in this paper.

The detailed electromagnetic design, multipactingsimulation, mechanical analysis of the cavity will be given in this paper.

Feynman Rules of Higher-order Poles in CHY Construction

  In this paper, we generalize the integration rules for scattering equationsto situations where higher-order poles are present. We describe the strategy todeduce the Feynman rules of higher-order poles from known analytic results ofsimple CHY-integrands, and propose the Feynman rules for single double pole andtriple pole as well as duplex-double pole and triplex-double pole structures.We demonstrate the validation and strength of these rules by ample non-trivialexamples.

  Flexible metal oxide/graphene oxide hybrid multi-gate neuron transistors werefabricated on flexible graphene substrates. Dendritic integrations in bothspatial and temporal modes were successfully emulated, and spatiotemporalcorrelated logics were obtained. A proof-of-principle visual system model foremulating lobula giant motion detector neuron was investigated. Our results areof great interest for flexible neuromorphic cognitive systems.

Electromagnetically Induced Transparency with Superradiant and  Subradiant states

  We construct the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) bydynamically coupling a superradiant state with a subradiant state. Thesuperradiant and subradiant states with enhanced and inhibited decay rates actas the excited and metastable states in EIT, respectively. Their energydifference determined by the distance between the atoms can be measured by theEIT spectra, which renders this method useful in subwavelength metrology. Thescheme can also be applied to many atoms in nuclear quantum optics, where thetransparency point due to counter-rotating wave terms can be observed.

Evolutionary Multitasking for Single-objective Continuous Optimization:  Benchmark Problems, Performance Metric, and Baseline Results

  In this report, we suggest nine test problems for multi-task single-objectiveoptimization (MTSOO), each of which consists of two single-objectiveoptimization tasks that need to be solved simultaneously. The relationshipbetween tasks varies between different test problems, which would be helpful tohave a comprehensive evaluation of the MFO algorithms. It is expected that theproposed test problems will germinate progress the field of the MTSOO research.

Learning Spatial Regularization with Image-level Supervisions for  Multi-label Image Classification

  Multi-label image classification is a fundamental but challenging task incomputer vision. Great progress has been achieved by exploiting semanticrelations between labels in recent years. However, conventional approaches areunable to model the underlying spatial relations between labels in multi-labelimages, because spatial annotations of the labels are generally not provided.In this paper, we propose a unified deep neural network that exploits bothsemantic and spatial relations between labels with only image-levelsupervisions. Given a multi-label image, our proposed Spatial RegularizationNetwork (SRN) generates attention maps for all labels and captures theunderlying relations between them via learnable convolutions. By aggregatingthe regularized classification results with original results by a ResNet-101network, the classification performance can be consistently improved. The wholedeep neural network is trained end-to-end with only image-level annotations,thus requires no additional efforts on image annotations. Extensive evaluationson 3 public datasets with different types of labels show that our approachsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-arts and has strong generalizationcapability. Analysis of the learned SRN model demonstrates that it caneffectively capture both semantic and spatial relations of labels for improvingclassification performance.

Efficient feature learning and multi-size image steganalysis based on  CNN

  For steganalysis, many studies showed that convolutional neural network hasbetter performances than the two-part structure of traditional machine learningmethods. However, there are still two problems to be resolved: cutting downsignal to noise ratio of the steganalysis feature map and steganalyzing imagesof arbitrary size. Some algorithms required fixed size images as the input andhad low accuracy due to the underutilization of the noise residuals obtained byvarious types of filters. In this paper, we focus on designing an improvednetwork structure based on CNN to resolve the above problems. First, we use 3x3kernels instead of the traditional 5x5 kernels and optimize convolution kernelsin the preprocessing layer. The smaller convolution kernels are used to reducethe number of parameters and model the features in a small local region. Next,we use separable convolutions to utilize channel correlation of the residuals,compress the image content and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (between thestego signal and the image signal). Then, we use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)to aggregate the local features, enhance the representation ability offeatures, and steganalyze arbitrary size image. Finally, data augmentation isadopted to further improve network performance. The experimental results showthat the proposed CNN structure is significantly better than other four methodssuch as SRM, Ye-Net, Xu-Net, and Yedroudj-Net, when it is used to detect twospatial algorithms such as WOW and S-UNIWARAD with a wide variety of datasetsand payloads.

Experimental Test of Complementarity by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  Techniques

  We have tested complementarity for the ensemble-averaged spin states ofnuclei $^{13}$C in the molecule of $^{13}$CHCl$_{3}$ by the use of the spinstates of another nuclei $^{1}$H as the path marker. It turns out that thewave-particle duality holds when one merely measures the probability density ofquantum states, and that the wave- and particle-like behavior is simultaneouslyobserved with the help of measuring populations and coherence in a singlenuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) experiment. Effects of path-marking schemes andcauses of the appearance and disappearance of the wave behavior are analysed.

Sub-wavelength image manipulating through compensated anisotropic  metamaterial prisms

  Based on the concept of sub-wavelength imaging through compensated bilayer ofanisotropic metamaterials (AMMs), which is an expansion of the perfect lensconfiguration, we propose two dimensional prism pair structures of compensatedAMMs that are capable of manipulating two dimensional sub-wavelength images. Wedemonstrate that through properly designed symmetric and asymmetric compensatedprism pair structures planar image rotation with arbitrary angle, lateral imageshift, as well as image magnification could be achieved with sub-wavelengthresolution. Both theoretical analysis and full wave electromagnetic simulationshave been employed to verify the properties of the proposed prism structures.Utilizing the proposed AMM prisms, flat optical image of objects withsub-wavelength features can be projected and magnified to wavelength scaleallowing for further optical processing of the image by conventional optics.

Polarization modulation by tunable electromagnetic metamaterial  reflector/absorber

  We propose a polarization modulation scheme of electromagnetic (EM) wavesthrough reflection of a tunable metamaterial reflector/absorber. Byconstructing the metamaterial with resonant unit cells coupled by diodes, wedemonstrate that the EM reflections for orthogonal polarized incident waves canbe tuned independently by adjusting the bias voltages on the correspondingdiodes. Owing to this feature, the reflected EM waves can be electricallycontrolled to a linear polarization with continuously tunable azimuth anglefrom 0o to 90o at the resonant frequency, or an elliptical polarization withtunable azimuth angle of the major axis when off the resonant frequency. Theproposed property has been verified through both numerical simulations andexperimental measurements at microwave band, which enables us to electricallymodulate the polarization state of EM waves flexibly.

Probing Half-odd Topological Number with Cold Atoms in a Non-Abelian  Optical Lattice

  We propose an experimental scheme to probe the contribution of a single Diraccone to the Hall conductivity as half-odd topological number sequence. In ourscheme, the quantum anomalous Hall effect as in graphene is simulated with coldatoms trapped in an optical lattice and subjected to a laser-inducednon-Abelian gauge field. By tuning the laser intensity to change the gaugeflux, the energies of the four Dirac points in the first Brillouin zone areshifted with each other and the contribution of the single Dirac cone to thetotal atomic Hall conductivity is manifested. We also show such manifestationcan be experimentally probed with atomic density profile measurements.

Simulating Z_2 topological insulators with cold atoms in a  one-dimensional optical lattice

  We propose an experimental scheme to simulate and detect the properties oftime-reversal invariant topological insulators, using cold atoms trapped inone-dimensional bichromatic optical lattices. This system is described by aone-dimensional Aubry-Andre model with an additional SU(2) gauge structure,which captures the essential properties of a two-dimensional Z2 topologicalinsulator. We demonstrate that topologically protected edge states, withopposite spin orientations, can be pumped across the lattice by sweeping alaser phase adiabatically. This process constitutes an elegant way to transfertopologically protected quantum states in a highly controllable environment. Wediscuss how density measurements could provide clear signatures of thetopological phases emanating from our one-dimensional system.

A Hop-by-hop Cross-layer Congestion Control Scheme for Wireless Sensor  Networks

  Congestions in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) could potentially cause packetloss, throughput impairment and energy waste. To address this issue, ahop-by-hop cross-layer congestion control scheme (HCCC) built oncontention-based MAC protocol is proposed in this paper. According to MAC-layerchannel information including buffer occupancy ratio and congestion degree oflocal node, HCCC dynamically adjusts channel access priority in MAC layer anddata transmission rate of the node to tackle the problem of congestion.Simulations have been conducted to compare HCCC against closely-relatedexisting schemes. The results show that HCCC exhibits considerable superiorityin terms of packets loss ratio, throughput and energy efficiency.

Intrinsic spin Hall effect in monolayers of group-VI dichalcogenides: A  first-principles study

  Using first-principles calculations within density functional theory, weinvestigate the intrinsic spin Hall effect in monolayers of group-VItransition-metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se). MX2 monolayersare direct band-gap semiconductors with two degenerate valleys located at thecorners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Because of the inversion symmetrybreaking and the strong spin-orbit coupling, charge carriers in oppositevalleys carry opposite Berry curvature and spin moment, giving rise to both avalley- and a spin-Hall effect. The intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (ISHC) inp-doped samples is found to be much larger than the ISHC in n-doped samples dueto the large spin-splitting at the valence band maximum. We also show that theISHC in inversion-symmetric bulk dichalcogenides is an order of magnitudesmaller compared to monolayers. Our result demonstrates monolayerdichalcogenides as an ideal platform for the integration of valleytronics andspintronics.

Strain tuning of topological band order in cubic semiconductors

  We theoretically explore the possibility of tuning the topological order ofcubic diamond/zinc-blende semiconductors with external strain. Based on thetight-binding model, we analyze the evolution of the cubic semiconductor bandstructure under hydrostatic or biaxial lattice expansion, by which a genericguiding principle is established that lattice \emph{expansion} can induce atopological phase transition of small band-gap cubic semiconductors via a bandinversion, and further breaking of the cubic symmetry leads to a topologicalinsulating phase. Using density functional theory calculations, we demonstratethat a prototype topological trivial semiconductor, InSb, is converted to anontrivial topological semiconductor with a 2%-3% biaxial lattice expansion.
