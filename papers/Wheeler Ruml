On-line Planning and Scheduling: An Application to Controlling Modular  Printers

  We present a case study of artificial intelligence techniques applied to thecontrol of production printing equipment. Like many other real-worldapplications, this complex domain requires high-speed autonomousdecision-making and robust continual operation. To our knowledge, this workrepresents the first successful industrial application of embeddeddomain-independent temporal planning. Our system handles execution failures andmulti-objective preferences. At its heart is an on-line algorithm that combinestechniques from state-space planning and partial-order scheduling. We suggestthat this general architecture may prove useful in other applications as moreintelligent systems operate in continual, on-line settings. Our system has beenused to drive several commercial prototypes and has enabled a new productarchitecture for our industrial partner. When compared with state-of-the-artoff-line planners, our system is hundreds of times faster and often findsbetter plans. Our experience demonstrates that domain-independent AI planningbased on heuristic search can flexibly handle time, resources, replanning, andmultiple objectives in a high-speed practical application without requiringhand-coded control knowledge.

Best-First Heuristic Search for Multicore Machines

  To harness modern multicore processors, it is imperative to develop parallelversions of fundamental algorithms. In this paper, we compare differentapproaches to parallel best-first search in a shared-memory setting. We presenta new method, PBNF, that uses abstraction to partition the state space and todetect duplicate states without requiring frequent locking. PBNF allowsspeculative expansions when necessary to keep threads busy. We identify and fixpotential livelock conditions in our approach, proving its correctness usingtemporal logic. Our approach is general, allowing it to extend easily tosuboptimal and anytime heuristic search. In an empirical comparison on STRIPSplanning, grid pathfinding, and sliding tile puzzle problems using 8-coremachines, we show that A*, weighted A* and Anytime weighted A* implementedusing PBNF yield faster search than improved versions of previous parallelsearch proposals.

Value Directed Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits with Structured Priors

  Multi-armed bandits are a quintessential machine learning problem requiringthe balancing of exploration and exploitation. While there has been progress indeveloping algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees, there has been lessfocus on practical near-optimal finite-time performance. In this paper, wepropose an algorithm for Bayesian multi-armed bandits that utilizesvalue-function-driven online planning techniques. Building on previous work onUCB and Gittins index, we introduce linearly-separable value functions thattake both the expected return and the benefit of exploration into considerationto perform n-step lookahead. The algorithm enjoys a sub-linear performanceguarantee and we present simulation results that confirm its strength inproblems with structured priors. The simplicity and generality of our approachmakes it a strong candidate for analyzing more complex multi-armed banditproblems.
