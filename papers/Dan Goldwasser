Ask, and shall you receive?: Understanding Desire Fulfillment in Natural
  Language Text

  The ability to comprehend wishes or desires and their fulfillment is
important to Natural Language Understanding. This paper introduces the task of
identifying if a desire expressed by a subject in a given short piece of text
was fulfilled. We propose various unstructured and structured models that
capture fulfillment cues such as the subject's emotional state and actions. Our
experiments with two different datasets demonstrate the importance of
understanding the narrative and discourse structure to address this task.


Leveraging Textual Specifications for Grammar-based Fuzzing of Network
  Protocols

  Grammar-based fuzzing is a technique used to find software vulnerabilities by
injecting well-formed inputs generated following rules that encode application
semantics. Most grammar-based fuzzers for network protocols rely on human
experts to manually specify these rules. In this work we study automated
learning of protocol rules from textual specifications (i.e. RFCs). We evaluate
the automatically extracted protocol rules by applying them to a
state-of-the-art fuzzer for transport protocols and show that it leads to a
smaller number of test cases while finding the same attacks as the system that
uses manually specified rules.
