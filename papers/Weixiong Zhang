Flexible and Approximate Computation through State-Space Reduction

  In the real world, insufficient information, limited computation resources,and complex problem structures often force an autonomous agent to make adecision in time less than that required to solve the problem at handcompletely. Flexible and approximate computations are two approaches todecision making under limited computation resources. Flexible computation helpsan agent to flexibly allocate limited computation resources so that the overallsystem utility is maximized. Approximate computation enables an agent to findthe best satisfactory solution within a deadline. In this paper, we present twostate-space reduction methods for flexible and approximate computation:quantitative reduction to deal with inaccurate heuristic information, andstructural reduction to handle complex problem structures. These two methodscan be applied successively to continuously improve solution quality if morecomputation is available. Our results show that these reduction methods areeffective and efficient, finding better solutions with less computation thansome existing well-known methods.

An efficient algorithm for finding all possible input nodes for  controlling complex networks

  Understanding structural controllability of a complex network requires toidentify a Minimum Input nodes Set (MIS) of the network. It has been suggestedthat finding an MIS is equivalent to computing a maximum matching of thenetwork, where the unmatched nodes constitute an MIS. However, maximum matchingof a network is often not unique, and finding all MISs may provide deepinsights to the controllability of the network. Finding all possible inputnodes, which form the union of all MISs, is computationally challenging forlarge networks. Here we present an efficient enumerative algorithm for theproblem. The main idea is to modify a maximum matching algorithm to make itefficient for finding all possible input nodes by computing only one MIS. Werigorously proved the correctness of the new algorithm and evaluated itsperformance on synthetic and large real networks. The experimental resultsshowed that the new algorithm ran several orders of magnitude faster than theexisting method on large real networks.

Identification of hybrid node and link communities in complex networks

  Identification of communities in complex networks has become an effectivemeans to analysis of complex systems. It has broad applications in diverseareas such as social science, engineering, biology and medicine. Findingcommunities of nodes and finding communities of links are two popular schemesfor network structure analysis. These schemes, however, have inherent drawbacksand are often inadequate to properly capture complex organizational structuresin real networks. We introduce a new scheme and effective approach foridentifying complex network structures using a mixture of node and linkcommunities, called hybrid node-link communities. A central piece of ourapproach is a probabilistic model that accommodates node, link and hybridnode-link communities. Our extensive experiments on various real-worldnetworks, including a large protein-protein interaction network and a largesemantic association network of commonly used words, illustrated that thescheme for hybrid communities is superior in revealing network characteristics.Moreover, the new approach outperformed the existing methods for finding nodeor link communities separately.

An Effective Algorithm for and Phase Transitions of the Directed  Hamiltonian Cycle Problem

  The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) is an important combinatorial problemwith applications in many areas. It is among the first problems used forstudying intrinsic properties, including phase transitions, of combinatorialproblems. While thorough theoretical and experimental analyses have been madeon the HCP in undirected graphs, a limited amount of work has been done for theHCP in directed graphs (DHCP). The main contribution of this work is aneffective algorithm for the DHCP. Our algorithm explores and exploits the closerelationship between the DHCP and the Assignment Problem (AP) and utilizes atechnique based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT). By combining effectivealgorithms for the AP and SAT, our algorithm significantly outperforms previousexact DHCP algorithms, including an algorithm based on the award-winningConcorde TSP algorithm. The second result of the current study is anexperimental analysis of phase transitions of the DHCP, verifying and refininga known phase transition of the DHCP.

SAS+ Planning as Satisfiability

  Planning as satisfiability is a principal approach to planning with manyeminent advantages. The existing planning as satisfiability techniques usuallyuse encodings compiled from STRIPS. We introduce a novel SAT encoding scheme(SASE) based on the SAS+ formalism. The new scheme exploits the structuralinformation in SAS+, resulting in an encoding that is both more compact andefficient for planning. We prove the correctness of the new encoding byestablishing an isomorphism between the solution plans of SASE and that ofSTRIPS based encodings. We further analyze the transition variables newlyintroduced in SASE to explain why it accommodates modern SAT solving algorithmsand improves performance. We give empirical statistical results to support ouranalysis. We also develop a number of techniques to further reduce the encodingsize of SASE, and conduct experimental studies to show the strength of eachindividual technique. Finally, we report extensive experimental results todemonstrate significant improvements of SASE over the state-of-the-art STRIPSbased encoding schemes in terms of both time and memory efficiency.

Quantum anomalous Hall multilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy

  Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a quantum Hall effect that occurswithout the need of external magnetic field. A system composed of multipleparallel QAH layers is an effective high Chern number QAH insulator and the keyto the applications of the dissipationless chiral edge channels in low energyconsumption electronics. Such a QAH multilayer can also be engineered intoother exotic topological phases such as a magnetic Weyl semimetal with only onepair of Weyl points. This work reports the first experimental realization ofQAH multilayers in the superlattices composed of magnetically doped(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ topological insulator and CdSe normal insulator layers grownby molecular beam epitaxy. The obtained multilayer samples show quantized Hallresistance $h/Ne$$^2$, where $h$ is the Planck's constant, $e$ is theelementary charge and $N$ is the number of the magnetic topological insulatorlayers, resembling a high Chern number QAH insulator.

Identifying network communities with a high resolution

  Community structure is an important property of complex networks. Anautomatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in manydisciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science.Recently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based onthe optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem ofmodularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often sufferfrom prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has beenrecently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have aresolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find highermodularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore,using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,to solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfullydetect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than theexisting algorithms. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to study aprotein-protein interaction network, and show that the combination of the twoalgorithms can reveal interesting biological results that may be otherwiseundetectable.
