Semantic Understanding of Professional Soccer Commentaries

  This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of semantic parsing vialearning the correspondences between complex sentences and rich sets of events.Our main intuition is that correct correspondences tend to occur morefrequently. Our model benefits from a discriminative notion of similarity tolearn the correspondence between sentence and an event and a ranking machinerythat scores the popularity of each correspondence. Our method can discover agroup of events (called macro-events) that best describes a sentence. Weevaluate our method on our novel dataset of professional soccer commentaries.The empirical results show that our method significantly outperforms thestate-of-theart.
