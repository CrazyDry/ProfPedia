Dynamic Blocking and Collapsing for Gibbs Sampling

  In this paper, we investigate combining blocking and collapsing -- two widelyused strategies for improving the accuracy of Gibbs sampling -- in the contextof probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We show that combining them is notstraight-forward because collapsing (or eliminating variables) introduces newdependencies in the PGM and in computation-limited settings, this may adverselyaffect blocking. We therefore propose a principled approach for tackling thisproblem. Specifically, we develop two scoring functions, one each for blockingand collapsing, and formulate the problem of partitioning the variables in thePGM into blocked and collapsed subsets as simultaneously maximizing bothscoring functions (i.e., a multi-objective optimization problem). We propose adynamic, greedy algorithm for approximately solving this intractableoptimization problem. Our dynamic algorithm periodically updates thepartitioning into blocked and collapsed variables by leveraging correlationstatistics gathered from the generated samples and enables rapid mixing byblocking together and collapsing highly correlated variables. We demonstrateexperimentally the clear benefit of our dynamic approach: as more samples aredrawn, our dynamic approach significantly outperforms static graph-basedapproaches by an order of magnitude in terms of accuracy.
