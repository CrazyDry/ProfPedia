Conditional Utility, Utility Independence, and Utility Networks

  We introduce a new interpretation of two related notions - conditionalutility and utility independence. Unlike the traditional interpretation, thenew interpretation renders the notions the direct analogues of theirprobabilistic counterparts. To capture these notions formally, we appeal to thenotion of utility distribution, introduced in previous paper. We show thatutility distributions, which have a structure that is identical to that ofprobability distributions, can be viewed as a special case of an additivemultiattribute utility functions, and show how this special case permits us tocapture the novel senses of conditional utility and utility independence.Finally, we present the notion of utility networks, which do for utilities whatBayesian networks do for probabilities. Specifically, utility networks exploitthe new interpretation of conditional utility and utility independence tocompactly represent a utility distribution.

Mechanism Design with Execution Uncertainty

  We introduce the notion of fault tolerant mechanism design, which extends thestandard game theoretic framework of mechanism design to allow for uncertaintyabout execution. Specifically, we define the problem of task allocation inwhich the private information of the agents is not only their costs to attemptthe tasks, but also their probabilities of failure. For several differentinstances of this setting we present technical results, including positive onesin the form of mechanisms that are incentive compatible, individually rationaland efficient, and negative ones in the form of impossibility theorems.

Stable Invitations

  We consider the situation in which an organizer is trying to convene anevent, and needs to choose a subset of agents to be invited. Agents havepreferences over how many attendees should be at the event and possibly alsowho the attendees should be. This induces a stability requirement: All invitedagents should prefer attending to not attending, and all the other agentsshould not regret being not invited. The organizer's objective is to find theinvitation of maximum size subject to the stability requirement. We investigatethe computational complexity of finding the maximum stable invitation when allagents are truthful, as well as the mechanism design problem when agents maystrategically misreport their preferences.

Truth Revelation in Approximately Efficient Combinatorial Auctions

  Some important classical mechanisms considered in Microeconomics and GameTheory require the solution of a difficult optimization problem. This is trueof mechanisms for combinatorial auctions, which have in recent years assumedpractical importance, and in particular of the gold standard for combinatorialauctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). Traditional analysis of thesemechanisms - in particular, their truth revelation properties - assumes thatthe optimization problems are solved precisely. In reality, these optimizationproblems can usually be solved only in an approximate fashion. We investigatethe impact on such mechanisms of replacing exact solutions by approximate ones.Specifically, we look at a particular greedy optimization method. We show thatthe GVA payment scheme does not provide for a truth revealing mechanism. Weintroduce another scheme that does guarantee truthfulness for a restrictedclass of players. We demonstrate the latter property by identifying naturalproperties for combinatorial auctions and showing that, for our restrictedclass of players, they imply that truthful strategies are dominant. Thoseproperties have applicability beyond the specific auction studied.

Expected Utility Networks

  We introduce a new class of graphical representations, expected utilitynetworks (EUNs), and discuss some of its properties and potential applicationsto artificial intelligence and economic theory. In EUNs not only probabilities,but also utilities enjoy a modular representation. EUNs are undirected graphswith two types of arc, representing probability and utility dependenciesrespectively. The representation of utilities is based on a novel notion ofconditional utility independence, which we introduce and discuss in the contextof other existing proposals. Just as probabilistic inference involves thecomputation of conditional probabilities, strategic inference involves thecomputation of conditional expected utilities for alternative plans of action.We define a new notion of conditional expected utility (EU) independence, andshow that in EUNs node separation with respect to the probability and utilitysubgraphs implies conditional EU independence.

Collusion in Unrepeated, First-Price Auctions with an Uncertain Number  of Participants

  We consider the question of whether collusion among bidders (a "biddingring") can be supported in equilibrium of unrepeated first-price auctions.Unlike previous work on the topic such as that by McAfee and McMillan [1992]and Marshall and Marx [2007], we do not assume that non-colluding agents haveperfect knowledge about the number of colluding agents whose bids aresuppressed by the bidding ring, and indeed even allow for the existence ofmultiple cartels. Furthermore, while we treat the association of bidders withbidding rings as exogenous, we allow bidders to make strategic decisions aboutwhether to join bidding rings when invited. We identify a bidding ring protocolthat results in an efficient allocation in Bayes{Nash equilibrium, under whichnon-colluding agents bid straightforwardly, and colluding agents join biddingrings when invited and truthfully declare their valuations to the ring center.We show that bidding rings benefit ring centers and all agents, both membersand non-members of bidding rings, at the auctioneer's expense. The techniqueswe introduce in this paper may also be useful for reasoning about otherproblems in which agents have asymmetric information about a setting.
