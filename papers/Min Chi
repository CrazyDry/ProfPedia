Supersymmetry, quark confinement and the harmonic oscillator

  We study some quantum systems described by noncanonical commutation relationsformally expressed as [q,p]=ihbar(I + chi H), where H is the associated(harmonic oscillator-like) Hamiltonian of the system, and chi is a Hermitian(constant) operator, i.e. [H,chi]=0 . In passing, we also consider a simple(chi=0 canonical) model, in the framework of a relativistic Klein-Gordon-likewave equation.

Chromatic Zagreb indices for graphical embodiment of colour clusters

  For a colour cluster $\mathbb{C} =(\mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2,\mathcal{C}_3,\ldots,\mathcal{C}_\ell)$, where $\mathcal{C}_i$ is a colourclass such that $|\mathcal{C}_i|=r_i$, a positive integer, we investigate twotypes of simple connected graph structures $G^{\mathbb{C}}_1$,$G^{\mathbb{C}}_2$ which represent graphical embodiments of the colour clustersuch that the chromatic numbers$\chi(G^{\mathbb{C}}_1)=\chi(G^{\mathbb{C}}_2)=\ell$ and$\min\{\varepsilon(G^{\mathbb{C}}_1)\}=\min\{\varepsilon(G^{\mathbb{C}}_2)\}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\ell}r_i-1$. Therefore, the problem is the edge-minimalityinverse to finding the chromatic number of a given simple connected graph. Inthis paper, we also discuss the chromatic Zagreb indices corresponding to$G^{\mathbb{C}}_1$, $G^{\mathbb{C}}_2$.

Additivity of Heegaard genera of bounded surface sums

  Let $M$ be a surface sum of 3-manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ along a boundedconnected surface $F$ and $\partial_i$ be the component of $\partial M_i$containing $F$. If $M_i$ has a high distance Heegaard splitting, then anyminimal Heegaard splitting of $M$ is the amalgamation of those of $M^1, M^2$and $M^*$, where $M^i=M_i\setminus\partial_i\times I$, and$M^{*}=\partial_1\times I\cup_{F} \partial_2\times I$. Furthermore, once both$\partial_i\setminus F$ are connected, then $g(M) = Min\bigl\{g(M_1)+g(M_2),\alpha\bigr\}$, where $\alpha = g(M_1) + g(M_2) + 1/2(2\chi(F) + 2 -\chi(\partial_1) - \chi(\partial_2)) - Max\bigl\{g(\partial_1),g(\partial_2)\bigl\}$; in particular $g(M)=g(M_1)+g(M_2)$ if and only if$\chi(F)\geq 1/2Max\bigl\{\chi(\partial_1), \chi(\partial_2)\bigr\}.$  The proofs rely on Scharlemann-Tomova's theorem.

Parameter Estimation in Astronomy with Poisson-Distributed Data. I. The  Chi-Square-Gamma Statistic

  Applying the standard weighted mean formula, [sum_i {n_i sigma^{-2}_i}] /[sum_i {sigma^{-2}_i}], to determine the weighted mean of data, n_i, drawn froma Poisson distribution, will, on average, underestimate the true mean by ~1 forall true mean values larger than ~3 when the common assumption is made that theerror of the ith observation is sigma_i = max(sqrt{n_i},1). This small, butstatistically significant offset, explains the long-known observation thatchi-square minimization techniques which use the modified Neyman's chi-squarestatistic, chi^2_{N} equiv sum_i (n_i-y_i)^2 / max(n_i,1), to comparePoisson-distributed data with model values, y_i, will typically predict a totalnumber of counts that underestimates the true total by about 1 count per bin.Based on my finding that the weighted mean of data drawn from a Poissondistribution can be determined using the formula [sum_i [n_i + min(n_i,1)](n_i+1)^{-1}] / [sum_i (n_i+1)^{-1}], I propose that a new chi-squarestatistic, chi^2_gamma equiv sum_i [n_i + min(n_i,1) - y_i]^2 / [n_i + 1],should always be used to analyze Poisson-distributed data in preference to themodified Neyman's chi-square statistic. I demonstrate the power and usefulnessof chi-square-gamma minimization by using two statistical fitting techniquesand five chi-square statistics to analyze simulated X-ray power-law 15-channelspectra with large and small counts per bin. I show that chi-square-gammaminimization with the Levenberg-Marquardt or Powell's method can produceexcellent results (mean slope errors <=3%) with spectra having as few as 25total counts.

Existence of Traveling wave solutions of parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis  systems

  The current paper is devoted to the study of traveling wave solutions of thefollowing parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis systems, $$ \begin{cases} u_{t}=\Delta u-\chi \nabla \cdot (u \nabla v) + u(a-bu),\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^N \tauv_t=\Delta v-v+u, \quad x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \end{cases} $$ where $u(x,t)$represents the population density of a mobile species and $v(x,t)$ representsthe population density of a chemoattractant, and $\chi$ represents thechemotaxis sensitivity. We prove that for every $\tau >0$, there is$0<\chi_{\tau}^*<\frac{b}{2}$ such that for every $0<\chi<\chi_{\tau}^*$, thereexist two positive numbers $2\sqrt a \le c^{*}(\chi,\tau)<c^{**}(\chi,\tau)$satisfying that for every $ c\in [ c^{*}(\chi,\tau)\,\ c^{**}(\chi,\tau))$ and$\xi\in S^{N-1}$, the system has a traveling wave solution$(u(x,t),v(x,t))=(U(x\cdot\xi-ct;\tau),V(x\cdot\xi-ct;\tau))$ with speed $c$connecting the constant solutions $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{a}{b})$ and $(0,0)$, andit does not have such traveling wave solutions of speed less than $2\sqrt a$.Moreover, $$ \lim_{\chi\to 0^+}c^{**}(\chi,\tau)=\infty,$$ $$ \lim_{\chi\to0^+}c^{*}(\chi,\tau)=\begin{cases} 2\sqrt{a}\qquad \qquad \qquad\ \text{if}\quad 0<a\leq \frac{1+\tau a}{(1-\tau)_+}\cr \frac{1+\taua}{(1-\tau)_{+}}+\frac{a(1-\tau)_{+}}{1+\tau a}\quad \text{if} \quad a\geq\frac{1+\tau a}{(1-\tau)_+}, \end{cases} $$ and $$ \lim_{x\to-\infty}\frac{U(x;\tau)}{e^{-\mu x}}=1, $$ where $\mu$ is the only solution ofthe equation $\mu+\frac{a}{\mu}=c$ in the interval $(0, \min\{\sqrt a,\sqrt{\frac{1+\tau a}{(1-\tau)_+}}\})$. Furthermore, it hods that$\lim_{\tau\to 0^+}\chi_{\tau}^*=\frac{b}{2}$.

An improved upper bound for the bondage number of graphs on surfaces

  The bondage number $b(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of edgeswhose removal from $G$ results in a graph with larger domination number.Recently Gagarin and Zverovich showed that, for a graph $G$ with maximum degree$\Delta(G)$ and embeddable on an orientable surface of genus $h$ and anon-orientable surface of genus $k$,$b(G)\leq\min\{\Delta(G)+h+2,\Delta+k+1\}$. They also gave examples showingthat adjustments of their proofs implicitly provide better results for largervalues of $h$ and $k$. In this paper we establish an improved explicit upperbound for $b(G)$, using the Euler characteristic $\chi$ instead of the genera$h$ and $k$, with the relations $\chi=2-2h$ and $\chi=2-k$. We show that$b(G)\leq\Delta(G)+\lfloor r\rfloor$ for the case $\chi\leq0$ (i.e. $h\geq1$ or$k\geq2$), where $r$ is the largest real root of the cubic equation$z^3+2z^2+(6\chi-7)z+18\chi-24=0$. Our proof is based on the techniquedeveloped by Carlson-Develin and Gagarin-Zverovich, and includes someelementary calculus as a new ingredient. We also find an asymptoticallyequivalent result $b(G)\leq\Delta(G)+\lceil\sqrt{12-6\chi\,}-1/2\rceil$ for$\chi\leq0$, and a further improvement for graphs with large girth.

On Hanf numbers of the infinitary order property

  We study several cardinal, and ordinal--valued functions that are relativesof Hanf numbers. Let kappa be an infinite cardinal, and let T subseteqL_{kappa^+, omega} be a theory of cardinality <= kappa, and let gamma be anordinal >= kappa^+. For example we look at (1) mu_{T}^*(gamma, kappa):= min{mu^* for all phi in L_{infinity, omega}, with rk(phi)< gamma, if T has the(phi, mu^*)-order property then there exists a formula phi'(x;y) in L_{kappa^+,omega}, such that for every chi >= kappa, T has the (phi', chi)-orderproperty}; and (2) mu^*(gamma, kappa):= sup{mu_T^*(gamma, kappa)| T inL_{kappa^+,omega}}.

Homomorphism Complexes and k-Cores

  We prove that the topological connectivity of a graph homomorphism complexHom($G,K_m$) is at least $m-D(G)-2$, where $\displaystyle D(G)=\max_{H\subseteqG}\delta(H)$. This is a strong generalization of a theorem of Cuki\'{c} andKozlov, in which $D(G)$ is replaced by the maximum degree $\Delta(G)$. It alsogeneralizes the graph theoretic bound for chromatic number,$\displaystyle\chi(G)\leq D(G)+1$, as $\displaystyle\chi(G)=\min\{m:\text{Hom}(G,K_m)\neq\varnothing\}$. Furthermore, we use this result toexamine homological phase transitions in the random polyhedral complexesHom$(G(n,p),K_m)$ when $p=c/n$ for a fixed constant $c > 0$.

Prescribed Gauss curvature problem on singular surfaces

  We study the existence of at least one conformal metric of prescribedGaussian curvature on a closed surface $\Sigma$ admitting conical singularitiesof orders $\alpha_i$'s at points $p_i$'s. In particular, we are concerned withthe case where the prescribed Gaussian curvature is sign-changing. Such ageometrical problem reduces to solving a singular Liouville equation. Byemploying a min-max scheme jointly with a finite dimensional reduction method,we deduce new perturbative results providing existence when the quantity$\chi(\Sigma)+\sum_i \alpha_i$ approaches a positive even integer, where$\chi(\Sigma)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface $\Sigma$.

Hybrid bounds for twists of $GL(3)$ $L$-functions

  Let $\pi$ be a Hecke-Maass cusp form for $SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$ and$\chi=\chi_1\chi_2$ a Dirichlet character with $\chi_i$ primitive modulo $M_i$.Suppose that $M_1$, $M_2$ are primes such that$\max\{(M|t|)^{1/3+2\delta/3},M^{2/5}|t|^{-9/20},M^{1/2+2\delta}|t|^{-3/4+2\delta}\}(M|t|)^{\varepsilon}<M_1< \min\{(M|t|)^{2/5},(M|t|)^{1/2-8\delta}\}(M|t|)^{-\varepsilon}$ for any$\varepsilon>0$, where $M=M_1M_2$, $|t|\geq 1$ and $0<\delta< 1/52$. Then wehave $$ L\left(\frac{1}{2}+it,\pi\otimes \chi\right)\ll_{\pi,\varepsilon}(M|t|)^{3/4-\delta+\varepsilon}. $$

Exact Complexity of Exact-Four-Colorability

  Let $M_k \seq \nats$ be a given set that consists of $k$ noncontiguousintegers. Define $\exactcolor{M_k}$ to be the problem of determining whether$\chi(G)$, the chromatic number of a given graph $G$, equals one of the $k$elements of the set $M_k$ exactly. In 1987, Wagner \cite{wag:j:min-max} provedthat $\exactcolor{M_k}$ is $\bhlevel{2k}$-complete, where $M_k = \{6k+1, 6k+3,>..., 8k-1 \}$ and $\bhlevel{2k}$ is the $2k$th level of the boolean hierarchyover $\np$. In particular, for $k = 1$, it is DP-complete to determine whether$\chi(G) = 7$, where $\DP = \bhlevel{2}$. Wagner raised the question of howsmall the numbers in a $k$-element set $M_k$ can be chosen such that$\exactcolor{M_k}$ still is $\bhlevel{2k}$-complete. In particular, for $k =1$, he asked if it is DP-complete to determine whether $\chi(G) = 4$. In thisnote, we solve this question of Wagner and determine the precise threshold $t\in \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$ for which the problem $\exactcolor{\{t\}}$ jumps from NP toDP-completeness: It is DP-complete to determine whether $\chi(G) = 4$, yet$\exactcolor{\{3\}}$ is in $\np$. More generally, for each $k \geq 1$, we showthat $\exactcolor{M_k}$ is $\bhlevel{2k}$-complete for $M_k = \{3k+1, 3k+3,...,5k-1\}$.

The chromatic spectrum of signed graphs

  The chromatic number $\chi((G,\sigma))$ of a signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ is thesmallest number $k$ for which there is a function $c : V(G) \rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_k$ such that $c(v) \not= \sigma(e) c(w)$ for every edge $e = vw$.Let $\Sigma(G)$ be the set of all signatures of $G$. We study the chromaticspectrum $\Sigma_{\chi}(G) = \{\chi((G,\sigma))\colon\ \sigma \in \Sigma(G)\}$of $(G,\sigma)$. Let $M_{\chi}(G) = \max\{\chi((G,\sigma))\colon\ \sigma \in\Sigma(G)\}$, and $m_{\chi}(G) = \min\{\chi((G,\sigma))\colon\ \sigma \in\Sigma(G)\}$. We show that $\Sigma_{\chi}(G) = \{k : m_{\chi}(G) \leq k \leqM_{\chi}(G)\}$. We also prove some basic facts for critical graphs.  Analogous results are obtained for a notion of vertex-coloring of signedgraphs which was introduced by M\'{a}\v{c}ajov\'{a}, Raspaud, and \v{S}koviera.

Neighborhood complexes, homotopy test graphs and a contribution to a  conjecture of Hedetniemi

  The neighborhood complex $\N(G)$ of a graph $G$ were introduced by L.Lov{\'a}sz in his proof of Kneser conjecture. He proved that for any graph $G$,  \begin{align} \label{abstract} \chi(G) \geq conn(\N(G))+3.  \end{align}  In this article we show that for a class of exponential graphs the boundgiven in (\ref{abstract}) is sharp. Further, we show that the neighborhoodcomplexes of these exponential graphs are spheres up to homotopy.  We were also able to find a class of exponential graphs, which are homotopytest graphs.  Hedetniemi's conjecture states that the chromatic number of the categoricalproduct of two graphs is the minimum of the chromatic number of the factors.Let $M(G)$ denotes the Mycielskian of a graph $G$. We show that, for any graph$G$ containing $M(M(K_n))$ as a subgraph and for any graph $H$, if $\chi(G\times H) = n+1$, then $\min\{\chi(G), \chi(H)\} = n+1$. Therefore, we enrichthe family of graphs satisfying the Hedetniemi's conjecture.

Pseudo-Anosovs on closed surfaces having small entropy and the Whitehead  sister link exterior

  Let $\delta_g$ be the minimal dilatation for pseudo-Anosovs on a closedsurface $\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$ and let $\delta_g^+$ be the minimal dilatationfor pseudo-Anosovs on $\Sigma_g$ with orientable invariant foliations. Thispaper concerns the pseudo-Anosovs which occur as the monodromies on closedfibers for Dehn fillings of $N(r)$ for each $r \in \{-3/2, -1/2, 2\}$ of themagic manifold $N$. The manifold $N(-3/2)$ is homeomorphic to the Whiteheadsister link exterior.  We consider the set $\Lambda_g(r)$ (resp. $\Lambda_g^+(r)$) which consists ofthe dilatations of all monodromies (resp. monodromies having orientableinvariant foliations) on a closed fiber of genus $g$ for Dehn fillings of$N(r)$, where the fillings are on the boundary slopes of fibers of $N(r)$.Hironaka obtained upper bounds of $\delta_g$ and $\delta_g^+$ by computing$\min \Lambda_g(-1/2)$ and $\min \Lambda^+_g(-1/2)$ respectively. We prove that$\min \Lambda_g(-3/2)< \min \Lambda_g(-1/2)$ for $g \equiv 0,1,5,6,7,9\pmod{10}$ and $\min \Lambda^+_g(-3/2)< \min \Lambda^+_g(-1/2)$ for $g \equiv1,5,7,9 \pmod{10}$. These inequalities improve the previous upper bounds of$\delta_g$ and $\delta_g^+$ for these $g$.  We prove that for each $r \in \{-3/2, -1/2, 2\}$ and each $g \ge 3$, thereexists a monodromy $\Phi_g(r)$ on a closed fiber of genus $g $ for a Dehnfilling of $N(r)$ such that its dilatation $\lambda(\Phi_g(r))$ satisfies$\displaystyle \lim_{g \to \infty} |\chi(\Sigma_g)| \log \lambda (\Phi_g(r)) =2 \log((3+\sqrt{5})/2)$.

The Value of Interaction in Data Intelligence

  In human computer interaction (HCI), it is common to evaluate the value ofHCI designs, techniques, devices, and systems in terms of their benefit tousers. It is less common to discuss the benefit of HCI to computers. Every HCItask allows a computer to receive some data from the user. In many situations,the data received by the computer embodies human knowledge and intelligence inhandling complex problems, and/or some critical information without which thecomputer cannot proceed. In this paper, we present an information-theoreticframework for quantifying the knowledge received by the computer from its usersvia HCI. We apply information-theoretic measures to some common HCI tasks aswell as HCI tasks in complex data intelligence processes. We formalize themethods for estimating such quantities analytically and measuring themempirically. Using theoretical reasoning, we can confirm the significant butoften undervalued role of HCI in data intelligence workflows.

Minimization of Storage Cost in Distributed Storage Systems with Repair  Consideration

  In a distributed storage system, the storage costs of different storagenodes, in general, can be different. How to store a file in a given set ofstorage nodes so as to minimize the total storage cost is investigated. Byanalyzing the min-cut constraints of the information flow graph, the feasibleregion of the storage capacities of the nodes can be determined. The storagecost minimization can then be reduced to a linear programming problem, whichcan be readily solved. Moreover, the tradeoff between storage cost andrepair-bandwidth is established.

About maximal number of edges in hypergraph-clique with chromatic number  3

  Let $ H = (V,E) $ be a hypergraph. By the chromatic number of a hypergraph $H = (V,E) $ we mean the minimum number $\chi(H)$ of colors needed to paint allthe vertices in $ V $ so that any edge $ e \in E $ contains at least twovertices of some different colors. Finally, a hypergraph is said to form aclique, if its edges are pairwise intersecting.  In 1973 Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz noticed that if an $n$-uniform hypergraph $ H= (V,E) $ forms a clique, then $ \chi(H) \in \{2,3\} $. They untoducedfollowing quantity. $$ M(n) = \max \{|E|: \exists {\rm an} n-{\rm uniform} {\rmclique} H = (V,E) {\rm with} \chi(H) = 3\}. $$ Obviously such definition has nosense in the case of $ \chi(H) = 2 $.  Theorem 1 (P. Erdos, L. Lovasz} The inequalities hold $$ n!(e-1) \le M(n) \len^n. $$  Almost nothing better has been done during the last 35 years.  At the same time, another quantity $ r(n) $ was introduced by Lovasz r(n) =\max \{|E|: ~ \exists {\rm an} ~ n-{\rm uniform} ~ {\rm clique} ~ H = (V,E) ~{\rm s.t.} ~ \tau(H) = n\}, $$ where $ \tau(H) $ is the {\it covering number}of $ H $, i.e., $$ \tau(H) = \min \{|f|: ~ f \subset V, ~ \forall ~ e \in E ~ f\cap e \neq \emptyset\}. $$ Clearly, for any $n$-uniform clique $ H $, we have$ \tau(H) \le n $, and if $ \chi(H) = 3 $, then $ \tau(H) = n $. Thus, $ M(n)\le r(n) $. Lov\'asz noticed that for $ r(n) $ the same estimates as in Theorem1 apply and conjectured that the lower estimate is best possible. In 1996 P.Frankl, K. Ota, and N. Tokushige disproved this conjecture and showed that $r(n) \ge (\frac{n}{2})^{n-1} $.  We discovered a new upper bound for the r(n) (so for M(n) too).  Theorem 2. $$ M(n) \leq r(n) \le c n^{n-1/2} \ln n. $$, where c is aconstant.

r-Dynamic Chromatic Number of Graphs

  An $r$-dynamic $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper vertex $k$-coloringsuch that the neighbors of any vertex $v$ receive at least $\min\{r,{\rmdeg}(v)\}$ different colors. The $r$-dynamic chromatic number of $G$,$\chi_r(G)$, is defined as the smallest $k$ such that $G$ admits an $r$-dynamic$k$-coloring. In this paper we introduce an upper bound for $\chi_r(G)$ interms of $r$, chromatic number, maximum degree and minimum degree. In 2001,Montgomery \cite{MR2702379} conjectured that, for a $d$-regular graph $G$,$\chi_2(G)-\chi(G)\leq 2$. In this regard, for a $d$-regular graph $G$, wepresent two upper bounds for $\chi_2(G)-\chi(G)$, one of them, $\lceil5.437\log d+2.721\rceil$, is an improvement of the bound $14.06\log d +1$,proved by Alishahi (2011) \cite{MR2746973}. Also, we give an upper bound for$\chi_2(G)$ in terms of chromatic number, maximum degree and minimum degree.

Hedetniemi's Conjecture Via Altermatic Number

  A $50$ years unsolved conjecture by Hedetniemi [{\it Homomorphisms of graphsand automata, \newblock {\em Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Michigan}, 1966}]asserts that the chromatic number of the categorical product of two graphs $G$and $H$ is $\min\{\chi(G),\chi(H)\}$. The present authors [{\it On thechromatic number of general {K}neser hypergraphs. \newblock {\em Journal ofCombinatorial Theory, Series B}, 2015.}] introduced the altermatic and thestrong altermatic number of graphs as two tight lower bounds for the chromaticnumber of graphs. In this work, we prove a relaxation of Hedetniemi'sconjecture in terms of strong altermatic number. Also, we present a tight lowerbound for the chromatic number of the categorical product of two graphs in termof their altermatic and strong altermatic numbers. These results enrich thefamily of pair graphs $\{G,H\}$ satisfying Hedetniemi's conjecture.

Electron-boson spectral density of LiFeAs obtained from optical data

  We analyze existing optical data in the superconducting state of LiFeAs at $T=$ 4 K, to recover its electron-boson spectral density. A maximum entropytechnique is employed to extract the spectral density $I^2\chi(\omega)$ fromthe optical scattering rate. Care is taken to properly account for elasticimpurity scattering which can importantly affect the optics in an $s$-wavesuperconductor, but does not eliminate the boson structure. We find a robustpeak in $I^2\chi(\omega)$ centered about $\Omega_R \cong$ 8.0 meV or 5.3 $k_BT_c$ (with $T_c =$ 17.6 K). Its position in energy agrees well with a similarstructure seen in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). There is also a peakin the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data at this same energy. This peakis found to persist in the normal state at $T =$ 23 K. There is evidence thatthe superconducting gap is anisotropic as was also found in low temperatureangular resolved photoemission (ARPES) data.

Potentially Large One-loop Corrections to WIMP Annihilation

  We compute one-loop corrections to the annihilation of non--relativisticparticles $\chi$ due to the exchange of a (gauge or Higgs) boson $\phi$ withmass $\mu$ in the initial state. In the limit $m_\chi \gg \mu$ this leads tothe "Sommerfeld enhancement" of the annihilation cross section. However, herewe are interested in the case $\mu \lsim m_\chi$, where the one--loopcorrections are well--behaved, but can still be sizable. We find simple andaccurate expressions for annihilation from both $S-$ and $P-$wave initialstates; they differ from each other if $\mu \neq 0$. In order to apply ourresults to the calculation of the relic density of Weakly Interacting MassiveParticles (WIMPs), we describe how to compute the thermal average of thecorrected cross sections. We apply this formalism to scalar and Dirac fermionsinglet WIMPs, and show that the corrections are always very small in theformer case, but can be very large in the latter. Moreover, in the context ofthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, these corrections can decrease therelic density of neutralinos by more than 1%, if the lightest neutralino is astrongly mixed state.

Upper bounds for the 2-hued chromatic number of graphs in terms of the  independence number

  A 2-hued coloring of a graph $G$ (also known as conditional $(k, 2)$-coloringand dynamic coloring) is a coloring such that for every vertex $v\in V(G)$ ofdegree at least $2$, the neighbors of $v$ receive at least $2$ colors. Thesmallest integer $k$ such that $G$ has a 2-hued coloring with $ k $ colors, iscalled the {\it 2-hued chromatic number} of $G$ and denoted by $\chi_2(G)$. Inthis paper, we will show that if $G$ is a regular graph, then $ \chi_{2}(G)-\chi(G) \leq 2 \log _{2}(\alpha(G)) +\mathcal{O}(1) $ and if $G$ is a graph and$\delta(G)\geq 2$, then $ \chi_{2}(G)- \chi(G) \leq 1+\lceil \sqrt[\delta-1]{4\Delta^{2}} \rceil ( 1+ \log _{\frac{2\Delta(G)}{2\Delta(G)-\delta(G)}}(\alpha(G)) ) $ and in general case if $G$ is a graph, then $ \chi_{2}(G)-\chi(G) \leq 2+ \min \lbrace\alpha^{\prime}(G),\frac{\alpha(G)+\omega(G)}{2}\rbrace $.

SUSY explanation of the Fermi Galactic Center Excess and its test at LHC  Run-II

  We explore the explanation of the Fermi Galactic Center Excess (GCE) in theNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We systematically considervarious experimental constraints including the Dark Matter (DM) relic density,DM direct detection results and indirect searches from dwarf galaxies. We findthat, for DM with mass ranging from $30 {\rm GeV}$ to $40 {\rm GeV}$, the GCEcan be explained by the annihilation $\chi \chi \to a^\ast \to b \bar{b}$ onlywhen the CP-odd scalar satisfies $m_a \simeq 2 m_\chi$, and in order to obtainthe measured DM relic density, a sizable $Z$-mediated contribution to DMannihilation must intervene in the early universe. As a result, the higgsinomass $\mu$ is upper bounded by about 350 GeV. Detailed Monte Carlo simulationson the $3\ell+ E_T^{miss}$ signal from neutralino/chargino associatedproduction at 14-TeV LHC indicate that the explanation can be mostly(completely) excluded at $95\%$ C.L. with an integrated luminosity of 100(200)fb$^{-1}$. We also discuss the implication of possible large $Z$ coupling to DMfor the DM-nucleon spin dependent (SD) scattering cross section, and find thatalthough the current experimental bounds on $\sigma^{\rm SD}_p$ is lessstringent than the spin independent (SI) results, the future XENON-1T and LZdata may be capable of testing most parts of the GCE-favored parameter region.

Time lag between prompt optical emission and gamma-rays in GRBs

  The prompt optical emission contemporaneous with the $\gamma$-rays from$\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) carries important information on the central engineand explosion mechanism. We study the time lag between prompt optical emissionand $\gamma$-rays in GRB 990123 and GRB 041219a, which are the only two GRBshad been detected at optical wavelengths during the ascending burst phase.Assuming profiles of prompt optical light curves are the same as the prompt$\gamma$-rays, we simulate optical light curves with different time lags andcompare them with the observed optical flux. Then the best fit time lag and itserror are determined by chi-squared values. We find that time lags betweenprompt optical emission and $\gamma$-rays in GRB host galaxy rest-frames areconsistent in the two GRBs, which is $5\sim7$ s for GRB 990123 and $1\sim5$ sfor GRB 041219a. This result is consistent with a common origin of promptoptical and $\gamma$-ray emissions in the two GRBs. Based on synchrotroncooling model, we also derive the parameters for the two GRBs.

On the Fairness of Rate Allocation in Gaussian Multiple Access Channel  and Broadcast Channel

  The capacity region of a channel consists of all achievable rate vectors.Picking a particular point in the capacity region is synonymous with rateallocation. The issue of fairness in rate allocation is addressed in thispaper. We review several notions of fairness, including max-min fairness,proportional fairness and Nash bargaining solution. Their efficiencies forgeneral multiuser channels are discussed. We apply these ideas to the Gaussianmultiple access channel (MAC) and the Gaussian broadcast channel (BC). We showthat in the Gaussian MAC, max-min fairness and proportional fairness coincide.For both Gaussian MAC and BC, we devise efficient algorithms that locate thefair point in the capacity region. Some elementary properties of fair rateallocations are proved.

On Learning Markov Chains

  The problem of estimating an unknown discrete distribution from its samplesis a fundamental tenet of statistical learning. Over the past decade, itattracted significant research effort and has been solved for a variety ofdivergence measures. Surprisingly, an equally important problem, estimating anunknown Markov chain from its samples, is still far from understood. Weconsider two problems related to the min-max risk (expected loss) of estimatingan unknown $k$-state Markov chain from its $n$ sequential samples: predictingthe conditional distribution of the next sample with respect to theKL-divergence, and estimating the transition matrix with respect to a naturalloss induced by KL or a more general $f$-divergence measure.  For the first measure, we determine the min-max prediction risk to within alinear factor in the alphabet size, showing it is $\Omega(k\log\log n\ / n)$and $\mathcal{O}(k^2\log\log n\ / n)$. For the second, if the transitionprobabilities can be arbitrarily small, then only trivial uniform risk upperbounds can be derived. We therefore consider transition probabilities that arebounded away from zero, and resolve the problem for essentially allsufficiently smooth $f$-divergences, including KL-, $L_2$-, Chi-squared,Hellinger, and Alpha-divergences.

Fourier expansions of GL(2) newforms at various cusps

  This paper studies the Fourier expansion of Hecke-Maass eigenforms for $GL(2,\mathbb Q)$ of arbitrary weight, level, and character at various cusps.Translating well known results in the theory of adelic automorphicrepresentations into classical language, a multiplicative expression for theFourier coefficients at any cusp is derived. In general, this expressioninvolves Fourier coefficients at several different cusps. A sufficientcondition for the existence of multiplicative relations among Fouriercoefficients at a single cusp is given. It is shown that if the level is 4times (or in some cases 8 times) an odd squarefree number then there aremultiplicative relations at every cusp. We also show that a localrepresentation of $GL(2, \mathbb Q_p)$ which is isomorphic to a local factor ofa global cuspidal automorphic representation generated by the adelic lift of anewform of arbitrary weight, level $N$, and character $\chi\pmod{N}$ cannot besupercuspidal if $\chi$ is primitive. Furthermore, it is supercuspidal if andonly if at every cusp (of width $m$ and cusp parameter = 0) the $mp^\ell$Fourier coefficient, at that cusp, vanishes for all sufficiently large positiveintegers $\ell$. In the last part of this paper a three term identity involvingthe Fourier expansion at three different cusps is derived.

Global Convergence of Non-Convex Gradient Descent for Computing Matrix  Squareroot

  While there has been a significant amount of work studying gradient descenttechniques for non-convex optimization problems over the last few years, allexisting results establish either local convergence with good rates or globalconvergence with highly suboptimal rates, for many problems of interest. Inthis paper, we take the first step in getting the best of both worlds --establishing global convergence and obtaining a good rate of convergence forthe problem of computing squareroot of a positive definite (PD) matrix, whichis a widely studied problem in numerical linear algebra with applications inmachine learning and statistics among others. Given a PD matrix $M$ and a PDstarting point $U_0$, we show that gradient descent with appropriately chosenstep-size finds an $\epsilon$-accurate squareroot of $M$ in $O(\alpha \log(\|M-U_0^2\|_F /\epsilon))$ iterations, where $\alpha =(\max\{\|U_0\|_2^2,\|M\|_2\} / \min \{\sigma_{\min}^2(U_0),\sigma_{\min}(M) \})^{3/2}$. Our result is the first to establish global convergence for thisproblem and that it is robust to errors in each iteration. A key contributionof our work is the general proof technique which we believe should furtherexcite research in understanding deterministic and stochastic variants ofsimple non-convex gradient descent algorithms with good global convergencerates for other problems in machine learning and numerical linear algebra.

Higgs decay to goldstini and its observability at the LHC

  If supersymmetry is broken independently in multiple sectors with differentscales, a number of goldstinos will be generated. One linear combination ofthese goldstinos is massless and eaten by the gravitino, while the orthogonalcombinations acquire a tree level mass and become the physical states namedgoldstini (G'). Compared to the gravitino, such goldstini could couple morestrongly to the visible fields and lead to some exotic phenomenology. In thisnote we first check the goldstini couplings in some GMSB models and find thatthe goldstini-photon-neutralino interaction may be very small while thegoldstini-Z-neutralino and goldstini-Higgs-neutralino interactions may besizable. This can induce a new decay mode for the Higgs boson: h-> G'+\chi ->Z+2G'. Then in an effective model with conservative fixed parameters we studythe observability of this decay channel at the LHC and find that it is notaccessible at the finished 8 TeV run (25 /fb) or 14 TeV run with 100 /fb, butmight be observed at the high luminosity LHC (14 TeV, 1000-3000 /fb) if thesystematics of the backgrounds can be well understood.

Pair Production of a 125 GeV Higgs Boson in MSSM and NMSSM at the LHC

  In light of the recent LHC Higgs search data, we investigate the pairproduction of a SM-like Higgs boson around 125 GeV in the MSSM and NMSSM. Wefirst scan the parameter space of each model by considering variousexperimental constraints, and then calculate the Higgs pair production rate inthe allowed parameter space. We find that in most cases the dominantcontribution to the Higgs pair production comes from the gluon fusion processand the production rate can be greatly enhanced, maximally 10 times larger thanthe SM prediction (even for a TeV-scale stop the production rate can still beenhanced by a factor of 1.3). We also calculate the chi-square value with thecurrent Higgs data and find that in the most favored parameter region theproduction rate is enhanced by a factor of 1.45 in the MSSM, while in the NMSSMthe production rate can be enhanced or suppressed (\sigma_{SUSY}/\sigma_{SM}varies from 0.7 to 2.4).

Multicell Coordinated Beamforming with Rate Outage Constraint--Part I:  Complexity Analysis

  This paper studies the coordinated beamforming (CoBF) design in themultiple-input single-output interference channel, assuming only channeldistribution information given a priori at the transmitters. The CoBF design isformulated as an optimization problem that maximizes a predefined systemutility, e.g., the weighted sum rate or the weighted max-min-fairness (MMF)rate, subject to constraints on the individual probability of rate outage andpower budget. While the problem is non-convex and appears difficult to handledue to the intricate outage probability constraints, so far it is still unknownif this outage constrained problem is computationally tractable. To answerthis, we conduct computational complexity analysis of the outage constrainedCoBF problem. Specifically, we show that the outage constrained CoBF problemwith the weighted sum rate utility is intrinsically difficult, i.e., NP-hard.Moreover, the outage constrained CoBF problem with the weighted MMF rateutility is also NP-hard except the case when all the transmitters are equippedwith single antenna. The presented analysis results confirm that efficientapproximation methods are indispensable to the outage constrained CoBF problem.

Context-aware Computing in the Internet of Things: A Survey on Internet  of Things From Industrial Market Perspective

  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information networkconsisting of Internet-connected objects, such as RFIDs, sensors, andactuators, as well as other instruments and smart appliances that are becomingan integral component of the Internet. Over the last few years, we have seen aplethora of IoT solutions making their way into the industry marketplace.Context-aware communication and computing has played a critical role throughoutthe last few years of ubiquitous computing and is expected to play asignificant role in the IoT paradigm as well. In this article, we examine avariety of popular and innovative IoT solutions in terms of context-awaretechnology perspectives. More importantly, we evaluate these IoT solutionsusing a framework that we built around well-known context-aware computingtheories. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptualframework for contextaware product development and research in the IoTparadigm. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing IoT products inthe marketplace and highlights a number of potentially significant researchdirections and trends.

RF-Based Charger Placement for Duty Cycle Guarantee in Battery-Free  Sensor Networks

  Battery-free sensor networks have emerged as a promising solution to conquerthe lifetime limitation of battery-powered systems. In this paper, we study asensor network built from battery-free sensor nodes which harvest energy fromradio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by RF-based chargers, e.g., radiofrequency identification (RFID) readers. Due to the insufficiency of harvestedenergy, the sensor nodes have to work in duty cycles to harvest enough energybefore turning active and performing tasks. One fundamental issue in this kindof network design is how to deploy the chargers to ensure that the battery-freenodes can maintain a designated duty cycle for continuous operation. Based on anew wireless recharge model, we formulate the charger placement problem fornode's duty cycle guarantee as a constrained optimization problem. We developboth greedy and efficient heuristics for solving the problem and validate oursolutions through extensive simulations. The simulation results show that theproposed particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based divide-and-conquer approachcan effectively reduce the number of chargers compared with the greedyapproach.

On the dimension of Furstenberg measure for $SL_2(R)$ random matrix  products

  Let $\mu$ be a measure on $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ generating a non-compact andtotally irreducible subgroup, let $\chi>0$ denote its Lyapunov exponent, andlet $\nu$ be the associated stationary (Furstenberg) measure for the action onthe projective line. We prove that if $\mu$ is supported on finitely manymatrices with algebraic entries, then \[\dim\nu=\min\{1,\frac{h_{\textrm{RW}}(\mu)}{2\chi}\} \] where$h_{\textrm{RW}}(\mu)$ is the random walk entropy of $\mu$, and $\dim$ denotespointwise dimension. In particular, for every $\delta>0$, there is aneighborhood $U$ of the identity in $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ such that if a measure$\mu\in\mathcal{P}(U)$ is supported on algebraic matrices with all atoms ofsize at least $\delta$, and generates a group which is non-compact and totallyirreducible, then its stationary measure $\nu$ satisfies $\dim\nu=1$.

Rectilinear Link Diameter and Radius in a Rectilinear Polygonal Domain

  We study the computation of the diameter and radius under the rectilinearlink distance within a rectilinear polygonal domain of $n$ vertices and $h$holes. We introduce a \emph{graph of oriented distances} to encode the distancebetween pairs of points of the domain. This helps us transform the problem sothat we can search through the candidates more efficiently. Our algorithmcomputes both the diameter and the radius in $\min \{\,O(n^\omega), O(n^2 + nh\log h + \chi^2)\,\}$ time, where $\omega<2.373$ denotes the matrixmultiplication exponent and $\chi\in \Omega(n)\cap O(n^2)$ is the number ofedges of the graph of oriented distances. We also provide a faster algorithmfor computing the diameter that runs in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.

Distributed coloring of graphs with an optimal number of colors

  This paper studies sufficient conditions to obtain efficient distributedalgorithms coloring graphs optimally (i.e.\ with the minimum number of colors)in the LOCAL model of computation. Most of the work on distributed vertexcoloring so far has focused on coloring graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ withat most $\Delta+1$ colors (or $\Delta$ colors when some simple obstructions areforbidden). When $\Delta$ is sufficiently large and $c\ge \Delta-k_\Delta+1$,for some integer $k_\Delta\approx \sqrt{\Delta}-2$, we give a distributedalgorithm that given a $c$-colorable graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$,finds a $c$-coloring of $G$ in $\min\{O((\log\Delta)^{1/12}\log n), 2^{O(\log\Delta+\sqrt{\log \log n})}\}$ rounds, with high probability. The lower bound$\Delta-k_\Delta+1$ is best possible in the sense that for infinitely manyvalues of $\Delta$, we prove that when $\chi(G)\le \Delta -k_\Delta$, findingan optimal coloring of $G$ requires $\Omega(n)$ rounds. Our proof is a lightadaptation of a remarkable result of Molloy and Reed, who proved that for$\Delta$ large enough, for any $c\ge \Delta - k_\Delta$ deciding whether$\chi(G)\le c$ is in {\textsf{P}}, while Embden-Weinert \emph{et al.}\ provedthat for $c\le \Delta-k_\Delta-1$, the same problem is {\textsf{NP}}-complete.Note that the sequential and distributed thresholds differ by one. We also showthat for any sufficiently large $\Delta$, and $\Omega(\log \Delta)\le k \le\Delta/100$, every graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ and clique number at most$\Delta-k$ can be efficiently colored with at most $\Delta-\varepsilon k$colors, for some absolute constant $\varepsilon >0$, with a randomizedalgorithm running in $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ rounds with high probability.

Quantum Chi-Squared and Goodness of Fit Testing

  The density matrix in quantum mechanics parameterizes the statisticalproperties of the system under observation, just like a classical probabilitydistribution does for classical systems. The expectation value of observablescannot be measured directly, it can only be approximated by applying classicalstatistical methods to the frequencies by which certain measurement outcomes(clicks) are obtained. In this paper, we make a detailed study of thestatistical fluctuations obtained during an experiment in which a hypothesis istested, i.e. the hypothesis that a certain setup produces a given quantumstate. Although the classical and quantum problem are very much related to eachother, the quantum problem is much richer due to the additional optimizationover the measurement basis. Just as in the case of classical hypothesistesting, the confidence in quantum hypothesis testing scales exponentially inthe number of copies. In this paper, we will argue 1) that the physicallyrelevant data of quantum experiments is only contained in the frequencies ofthe measurement outcomes, and that the statistical fluctuations of theexperiment are essential, so that the correct formulation of the conclusions ofa quantum experiment should be given in terms of hypothesis tests, 2) that the(classical) $\chi^2$ test for distinguishing two quantum states gives rise tothe quantum $\chi^2$ divergence when optimized over the measurement basis, 3)present a max-min characterization for the optimal measurement basis forquantum goodness of fit testing, find the quantum measurement which leads bothto the maximal Pitman and Bahadur efficiency, and determine the associateddivergence rates.

Status of low energy SUSY models confronted with the LHC 125 GeV Higgs  data

  Confronted with the LHC data of a Higgs boson around 125 GeV, differentmodels of low energy SUSY show different behaviors: some are favored, some aremarginally survived and some are strongly disfavored or excluded. In this notewe update our previous scan over the parameter space of various low energy SUSYmodels by considering the latest experimental limits like the LHCb data forB_s->\mu^+\mu^- and the XENON 100(2012) data for dark matter-neucleonscattering. Then we confront the predicted properties of the SM-like Higgsboson in each model with the combined 7 TeV and 8 TeV Higgs search data of theLHC. For a SM-like Higgs boson around 125 GeV, we have the followingobservations: (i) The most favored model is the NMSSM, whose predictions aboutthe Higgs boson can naturally (without any fine tuning) agree with theexperimental data at 1-sigma level, better than the SM; (ii) The MSSM can fitthe LHC data quite well but suffer from some extent of fine tuning; (iii) ThenMSSM is excluded at 3-sigma level after considering all the available Higgsdata; (iv) The CMSSM is quite disfavored since it is hard to give a 125 GeVHiggs boson mass and at the same time cannot enhance the di-photon signal rate.

Dark matter in little Higgs model under current experimental constraints  from LHC, Planck and Xenon

  We examine the status of dark matter (heavy photon) in the littlest Higgsmodel with T-parity (LHT) in light of the new results from the LHC Higgssearch, the Planck dark matter relic density and the XENON100 limit on the darkmatter scattering off the nucleon. We obtain the following observations: (i)For the LHC Higgs data, the LHT can well be consistent with the CMS results butdisfavored by the ATLAS observation of diphoton enhancement; (ii) For the darkmatter relic density, the heavy photon in the LHT can account for the Planckdata for the small mass splitting of mirror lepton and heavy photon; (iii) Forthe dark matter scattering off the nucleon, the heavy photon can give aspin-independent cross section below the XENON100 upper limit for $m_{A_H}>95$GeV ($f> 665$ GeV); (iv) A fit using the CMS Higgs data gives the lowestchi-square of 2.63 (the SM value is 4.75) at $f\simeq$ 1120 GeV and$m_{A_H}\simeq$ 170 GeV (at this point the dark matter constraints from Planckand XENON100 can also be satisfied). Such a best point and its nearby favoredregion (even for a $f$ value up to 3.8 TeV) can be covered by the futureXENON1T (2017) experiment.

Spin dynamics near a putative antiferromagnetic quantum critical point  in Cu substituted BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and its relation to high-temperature  superconductivity

  We present the results of elastic and inelastic neutron scatteringmeasurements on non-superconductingBa(Fe${_{0.957}}$Cu${_{0.043}}$)${_2}$As${_2}$, a composition close to aquantum critical point between AFM ordered and paramagnetic phases. Bycomparing these results with the spin fluctuations in the low Cu composition aswell as the parent compound BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and superconductingBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ compounds, we demonstrate that paramagnon-likespin fluctuations are evident in the antiferromagnetically ordered state ofBa(Fe$_{0.957}$Cu$_{0.043}$)$_2$As$_2$, which is distinct from the AFM-likespin fluctuations in the superconducting compounds. Our observations suggestthat Cu substitution decouples the interaction between quasiparticles and thespin fluctuations. We also show that the spin-spin correlation length,${\xi(T)}$, increases rapidly as the temperature is lowered and find${\omega/T}$ scaling behavior, the hallmark of quantum criticality, at anantiferromagnetic quantum critical point.

Unconstrained Face Detection and Open-Set Face Recognition Challenge

  Face detection and recognition benchmarks have shifted toward more difficultenvironments. The challenge presented in this paper addresses the next step inthe direction of automatic detection and identification of people from outdoorsurveillance cameras. While face detection has shown remarkable success inimages collected from the web, surveillance cameras include more diverseocclusions, poses, weather conditions and image blur. Although faceverification or closed-set face identification have surpassed humancapabilities on some datasets, open-set identification is much more complex asit needs to reject both unknown identities and false accepts from the facedetector. We show that unconstrained face detection can approach high detectionrates albeit with moderate false accept rates. By contrast, open-set facerecognition is currently weak and requires much more attention.

Tunable disorder and localization in the rare-earth nickelates

  The rare-earth nickelates are a rich playground for transport properties,known to host non-Fermi liquid character, resistance saturation andmetal-insulator transitions. We report a study of transport in LaNiO3 in thepresence of tunable disorder induced by irradiation. While pristine LaNiO3samples are metallic, highly irradiated samples show insulating behaviour atall temperatures. Using irradiation fluence as a tuning handle, we uncover anintermediate region hosting a metal-insulator transition. This transition fallswithin the Mott-Ioffe-Regel regime wherein the mean free path is comparable tolattice spacing. In the high temperature metallic regime, we find a transitionfrom non-Fermi liquid to a Fermi-liquid-like character. On the insulating sideof the metal-insulator transition, we find behaviour that is consistent withweak localization. This is reflected in magnetoresistance that scales with thesquare of the field and in resistivity. In the highly irradiated insulatingsamples, we find good agreement with variable range hopping, consistent withAnderson localization. We find qualitatively similar behaviour in thick PrNiO3films as well. Our results demonstrate that ion irradiation can be used totailor transport, serving as an excellent tool to study the physics oflocalization.

Temperature-gradient-induced electrokinetic flow and thermoelectricity  of electrolyte solutions in a capillaries

  A systematic theoretical study of temperature-gradient-induced electrokineticflow and thermoelectric potential of electrolyte solutions in amicro-/nanocapillary is presented. The study is based on a semi-analyticalmodel developed by simultaneously solving the energy equation and thePoisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes equations with the lubrication theory. Thesemi-analytical model is shown to be mainly governed by eight parameters,including two temperature-related parameters (temperature and its gradient),two electrokinetic parameters ($\zeta$ potential and the ratio of capillaryradius to the Debye length $\kappa_0a$) and four physical properties of cationand anion (i.e. Soret coefficient difference $\Delta S_T$, average Soretcoefficient $S_T$, normalized difference in diffusivities $\chi$ and intrinsicPeclet number $\lambda$). It is found that the thermoelectric field is inducedby three effects, which are respectively due to (1) the difference in the Soretcoefficients of cation and anion; (2) the selective ion diffusion resultingfrom the temperature-modified Boltzmann distribution of ions; (3) the advectivetransport of ions caused by the fluid flow. The first thermoelectric effectprevails for lower $\zeta$ potentials or large $\kappa_0a$, while the second isdominant for higher $\zeta$ potentials with very small $\kappa_0a$. The firsttwo thermoelectric effects can cooperate or counteract depending on the sign of$\zeta\Delta S_T$. Finally, the temperature-gradient-induced electrokineticflow is found to be a superposition of an electroosmotic flow component due tothe thermoelectric field and a thermoosmotic flow component due to the combinedeffects of osmotic pressure and dielectric body force. These two flowcomponents may cooperate or counteract depending on values of $\zeta$ and$\kappa_0a$.

Mass - metallicity relation and fundamental metallicity relation of  metal-poor star-forming galaxies at $0.6<z<0.9$ from the eBOSS survey

  The stellar mass-metallicity relation ($M_* - Z$, MZR) indicates that themetallicities of galaxies increase with increasing stellar masses. Thefundamental metallicity relation (FMR) suggests that the galaxies with higherstar formation rates (SFRs) tend to have lower metallicities for a givenstellar mass. To examine whether the MZR and FMR still hold at poorermetallicities and higher redshifts, we compile a sample of 35 star-forminggalaxies (SFGs) at $0.6<z<0.9$ using the public spectral database ($\rmv5\_10\_0$) of emission-line galaxies from the extended Baryon OscillationSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). These galaxies are identified for theirsignificant auroral $\rm [OIII]\lambda4363$ emission line ($\rm S/N \geq 3$).With the electronic temperature metallicity calibration, we find nine SFGs areextremely metal-poor galaxies with $\rm 12 + log(O/H) \leq 7.69 \ (1/10 \Z_\odot)$. The metallicity of the most metal-deficient galaxy is $7.35\pm 0.09$(about 1/20 $Z_{\odot}$). Compared with the SFGs with normal metallicities inlocal and high redshift universe, our metal-poor SFGs have more than ten timeshigher SFRs at a fixed stellar mass. We create a new mass -- SFR relation forthese metal-poor galaxies at $0.6<z<0.9$. Due to the higher SFRs and youngerstellar ages, our metal-poor SFGs deviate from the MZR and FMR in the localuniverse toward lower metallicities, confirming the existence of FMR, as wellas the cosmic evolution of MZR and FMR with redshift.

Search for the radiative transitions $ψ(3770)\toγη_c$ and  $γη_c(2S)$

  By using a 2.92 fb$^{-1}$ data sample taken at $\sqrt{s} = 3.773$ GeV withthe BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, we search for theradiative transitions $\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c$ and $\gamma\eta_c(2S)$through the hadronic decays $\eta_c(\eta_c(2S))\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$. Nosignificant excess of signal events above background is observed. We set upperlimits at a 90% confidence level for the product branching fractions to be$\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c)\times \mathcal{B}(\eta_c\toK^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp) < 1.6\times10^{-5}$ and$\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c(2S))\times \mathcal{B}(\eta_c(2S)\toK^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp) < 5.6\times10^{-6}$. Combining our result with world-averagevalues of $\mathcal{B}(\eta_c(\eta_c(2S))\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp)$, we find thebranching fractions $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c) < 6.8\times10^{-4}$and $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c(2S)) < 2.0\times10^{-3}$ at a 90%confidence level.
