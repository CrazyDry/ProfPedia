Machine Reading with Background Knowledge

  Intelligent systems capable of automatically understanding natural language
text are important for many artificial intelligence applications including
mobile phone voice assistants, computer vision, and robotics. Understanding
language often constitutes fitting new information into a previously acquired
view of the world. However, many machine reading systems rely on the text alone
to infer its meaning. In this paper, we pursue a different approach; machine
reading methods that make use of background knowledge to facilitate language
understanding. To this end, we have developed two methods: The first method
addresses prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. It uses background
knowledge within a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from
both labeled and unlabeled data. This approach yields state-of-the-art results
on two datasets against strong baselines; The second method extracts
relationships from compound nouns. Our knowledge-aware method for compound noun
analysis accurately extracts relationships and significantly outperforms a
baseline that does not make use of background knowledge.


Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Probabilistic Logic Approach

  We propose an efficient method to estimate the accuracy of classifiers using
only unlabeled data. We consider a setting with multiple classification
problems where the target classes may be tied together through logical
constraints. For example, a set of classes may be mutually exclusive, meaning
that a data instance can belong to at most one of them. The proposed method is
based on the intuition that: (i) when classifiers agree, they are more likely
to be correct, and (ii) when the classifiers make a prediction that violates
the constraints, at least one classifier must be making an error. Experiments
on four real-world data sets produce accuracy estimates within a few percent of
the true accuracy, using solely unlabeled data. Our models also outperform
existing state-of-the-art solutions in both estimating accuracies, and
combining multiple classifier outputs. The results emphasize the utility of
logical constraints in estimating accuracy, thus validating our intuition.


Discourse in Multimedia: A Case Study in Information Extraction

  To ensure readability, text is often written and presented with due
formatting. These text formatting devices help the writer to effectively convey
the narrative. At the same time, these help the readers pick up the structure
of the discourse and comprehend the conveyed information. There have been a
number of linguistic theories on discourse structure of text. However, these
theories only consider unformatted text. Multimedia text contains rich
formatting features which can be leveraged for various NLP tasks. In this
paper, we study some of these discourse features in multimedia text and what
communicative function they fulfil in the context. We examine how these
multimedia discourse features can be used to improve an information extraction
system. We show that the discourse and text layout features provide information
that is complementary to lexical semantic information commonly used for
information extraction. As a case study, we use these features to harvest
structured subject knowledge of geometry from textbooks. We show that the
harvested structured knowledge can be used to improve an existing solver for
geometry problems, making it more accurate as well as more explainable.


The extraordinary linear polarisation structure of the southern
  Centaurus A lobe revealed by ASKAP

  We present observations of linear polarisation in the southern radio lobe of
Centaurus A, conducted during commissioning of the Australian Square Kilometre
Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. We used 16 antennas to observe a 30 square
degree region in a single 12 hour pointing over a 240 MHz band centred on 913
MHz. Our observations achieve an angular resolution of $26\times33$ arcseconds
(480 parsecs), a maximum recoverable angular scale of 30 arcminutes, and a
full-band sensitivity of 85 $\muup$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The resulting maps of
polarisation and Faraday rotation are amongst the most detailed ever made for
radio lobes, with of order 10$^5$ resolution elements covering the source. We
describe several as-yet unreported observational features of the lobe,
including its detailed peak Faraday depth structure, and intricate networks of
depolarised filaments. These results demonstrate the exciting capabilities of
ASKAP for widefield radio polarimetry.


Scoup-SMT: Scalable Coupled Sparse Matrix-Tensor Factorization

  How can we correlate neural activity in the human brain as it responds to
words, with behavioral data expressed as answers to questions about these same
words? In short, we want to find latent variables, that explain both the brain
activity, as well as the behavioral responses. We show that this is an instance
of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem. We propose
Scoup-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problem
and produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments,
we find that Scoup-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm
for CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extend
Scoup-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We apply
Scoup-SMT to BrainQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human
subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the
nouns dimension. Scoup-SMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as well
as to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the generality of Scoup-SMT, by applying it on a Facebook dataset (users,
friends, wall-postings); there, Scoup-SMT spots spammer-like anomalies.


A Probabilistic Generative Grammar for Semantic Parsing

  We present a framework that couples the syntax and semantics of natural
language sentences in a generative model, in order to develop a semantic parser
that jointly infers the syntactic, morphological, and semantic representations
of a given sentence under the guidance of background knowledge. To generate a
sentence in our framework, a semantic statement is first sampled from a prior,
such as from a set of beliefs in a knowledge base. Given this semantic
statement, a grammar probabilistically generates the output sentence. A joint
semantic-syntactic parser is derived that returns the $k$-best semantic and
syntactic parses for a given sentence. The semantic prior is flexible, and can
be used to incorporate background knowledge during parsing, in ways unlike
previous semantic parsing approaches. For example, semantic statements
corresponding to beliefs in a knowledge base can be given higher prior
probability, type-correct statements can be given somewhat lower probability,
and beliefs outside the knowledge base can be given lower probability. The
construction of our grammar invokes a novel application of hierarchical
Dirichlet processes (HDPs), which in turn, requires a novel and efficient
inference approach. We present experimental results showing, for a simple
grammar, that our parser outperforms a state-of-the-art CCG semantic parser and
scales to knowledge bases with millions of beliefs.


Field-tunable quantum disordered ground state in the triangular lattice
  antiferromagnet NaYbO$_2$

  Antiferromagnetically coupled S=1/2 spins on an isotropic triangular lattice
is the paradigm of frustrated quantum magnetism, but structurally ideal
realizations are rare. Here we investigate NaYbO$_2$, which hosts an ideal
triangular lattice of $J_{eff}=1/2$ moments with no inherent site disorder. No
signatures of conventional magnetic order appear down to 50 mK, strongly
suggesting a quantum spin liquid ground state. We observe a two-peak specific
heat and a nearly quadratic temperature dependence in accord with expectations
for a two-dimensional Dirac spin liquid. Application of a magnetic field
strongly perturbs the quantum disordered ground state and induces a clear
transition into a collinear ordered state consistent with a long-predicted
up-up-down structure for a triangular lattice XXZ Hamiltonian driven by quantum
fluctuations. The observation of spin liquid signatures in zero field and
quantum-induced ordering in intermediate fields in the same compound
demonstrate an intrinsically quantum disordered ground state. We conclude that
NaYbO$_2$ is a model, versatile platform for exploring spin liquid physics with
full tunability of field and temperature.


Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation

  Current state-of-the-art NMT systems use large neural networks that are not
only slow to train, but also often require many heuristics and optimization
tricks, such as specialized learning rate schedules and large batch sizes. This
is undesirable as it requires extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper,
we propose a curriculum learning framework for NMT that reduces training time,
reduces the need for specialized heuristics or large batch sizes, and results
in overall better performance. Our framework consists of a principled way of
deciding which training samples are shown to the model at different times
during training, based on the estimated difficulty of a sample and the current
competence of the model. Filtering training samples in this manner prevents the
model from getting stuck in bad local optima, making it converge faster and
reach a better solution than the common approach of uniformly sampling training
examples. Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily applied to existing
NMT models by simply modifying their input data pipelines. We show that our
framework can help improve the training time and the performance of both
recurrent neural network models and Transformers, achieving up to a 70%
decrease in training time, while at the same time obtaining accuracy
improvements of up to 2.2 BLEU.


The Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer Book 2018

  (Abridged) This is the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer 2018 book. It is
intended as a concise reference guide to all aspects of the scientific and
technical design of MSE, for the international astronomy and engineering
communities, and related agencies. The current version is a status report of
MSE's science goals and their practical implementation, following the System
Conceptual Design Review, held in January 2018. MSE is a planned 10-m class,
wide-field, optical and near-infrared facility, designed to enable
transformative science, while filling a critical missing gap in the emerging
international network of large-scale astronomical facilities. MSE is completely
dedicated to multi-object spectroscopy of samples of between thousands and
millions of astrophysical objects. It will lead the world in this arena, due to
its unique design capabilities: it will boast a large (11.25 m) aperture and
wide (1.52 sq. degree) field of view; it will have the capabilities to observe
at a wide range of spectral resolutions, from R2500 to R40,000, with massive
multiplexing (4332 spectra per exposure, with all spectral resolutions
available at all times), and an on-target observing efficiency of more than
80%. MSE will unveil the composition and dynamics of the faint Universe and is
designed to excel at precision studies of faint astrophysical phenomena. It
will also provide critical follow-up for multi-wavelength imaging surveys, such
as those of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Gaia, Euclid, the Wide Field
Infrared Survey Telescope, the Square Kilometre Array, and the Next Generation
Very Large Array.


The Eleventh and Twelfth Data Releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey:
  Final Data from SDSS-III

  The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data
from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and
an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared
high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data
from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data
Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data
Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data
included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing.
Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new
spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the
number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO)
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial
velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity
Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured
abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added
2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the
Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey;
2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216
stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040
MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged
over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million
astronomical spectra.
