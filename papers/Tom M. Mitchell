Machine Reading with Background Knowledge

  Intelligent systems capable of automatically understanding natural languagetext are important for many artificial intelligence applications includingmobile phone voice assistants, computer vision, and robotics. Understandinglanguage often constitutes fitting new information into a previously acquiredview of the world. However, many machine reading systems rely on the text aloneto infer its meaning. In this paper, we pursue a different approach; machinereading methods that make use of background knowledge to facilitate languageunderstanding. To this end, we have developed two methods: The first methodaddresses prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. It uses backgroundknowledge within a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that learns fromboth labeled and unlabeled data. This approach yields state-of-the-art resultson two datasets against strong baselines; The second method extractsrelationships from compound nouns. Our knowledge-aware method for compound nounanalysis accurately extracts relationships and significantly outperforms abaseline that does not make use of background knowledge.

Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Probabilistic Logic Approach

  We propose an efficient method to estimate the accuracy of classifiers usingonly unlabeled data. We consider a setting with multiple classificationproblems where the target classes may be tied together through logicalconstraints. For example, a set of classes may be mutually exclusive, meaningthat a data instance can belong to at most one of them. The proposed method isbased on the intuition that: (i) when classifiers agree, they are more likelyto be correct, and (ii) when the classifiers make a prediction that violatesthe constraints, at least one classifier must be making an error. Experimentson four real-world data sets produce accuracy estimates within a few percent ofthe true accuracy, using solely unlabeled data. Our models also outperformexisting state-of-the-art solutions in both estimating accuracies, andcombining multiple classifier outputs. The results emphasize the utility oflogical constraints in estimating accuracy, thus validating our intuition.

Discourse in Multimedia: A Case Study in Information Extraction

  To ensure readability, text is often written and presented with dueformatting. These text formatting devices help the writer to effectively conveythe narrative. At the same time, these help the readers pick up the structureof the discourse and comprehend the conveyed information. There have been anumber of linguistic theories on discourse structure of text. However, thesetheories only consider unformatted text. Multimedia text contains richformatting features which can be leveraged for various NLP tasks. In thispaper, we study some of these discourse features in multimedia text and whatcommunicative function they fulfil in the context. We examine how thesemultimedia discourse features can be used to improve an information extractionsystem. We show that the discourse and text layout features provide informationthat is complementary to lexical semantic information commonly used forinformation extraction. As a case study, we use these features to harveststructured subject knowledge of geometry from textbooks. We show that theharvested structured knowledge can be used to improve an existing solver forgeometry problems, making it more accurate as well as more explainable.

The extraordinary linear polarisation structure of the southern  Centaurus A lobe revealed by ASKAP

  We present observations of linear polarisation in the southern radio lobe ofCentaurus A, conducted during commissioning of the Australian Square KilometreArray Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. We used 16 antennas to observe a 30 squaredegree region in a single 12 hour pointing over a 240 MHz band centred on 913MHz. Our observations achieve an angular resolution of $26\times33$ arcseconds(480 parsecs), a maximum recoverable angular scale of 30 arcminutes, and afull-band sensitivity of 85 $\muup$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The resulting maps ofpolarisation and Faraday rotation are amongst the most detailed ever made forradio lobes, with of order 10$^5$ resolution elements covering the source. Wedescribe several as-yet unreported observational features of the lobe,including its detailed peak Faraday depth structure, and intricate networks ofdepolarised filaments. These results demonstrate the exciting capabilities ofASKAP for widefield radio polarimetry.

Scoup-SMT: Scalable Coupled Sparse Matrix-Tensor Factorization

  How can we correlate neural activity in the human brain as it responds towords, with behavioral data expressed as answers to questions about these samewords? In short, we want to find latent variables, that explain both the brainactivity, as well as the behavioral responses. We show that this is an instanceof the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem. We proposeScoup-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problemand produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments,we find that Scoup-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithmfor CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extendScoup-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We applyScoup-SMT to BrainQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, humansubjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along thenouns dimension. Scoup-SMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as wellas to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy. Finally, we demonstratethe generality of Scoup-SMT, by applying it on a Facebook dataset (users,friends, wall-postings); there, Scoup-SMT spots spammer-like anomalies.

A Probabilistic Generative Grammar for Semantic Parsing

  We present a framework that couples the syntax and semantics of naturallanguage sentences in a generative model, in order to develop a semantic parserthat jointly infers the syntactic, morphological, and semantic representationsof a given sentence under the guidance of background knowledge. To generate asentence in our framework, a semantic statement is first sampled from a prior,such as from a set of beliefs in a knowledge base. Given this semanticstatement, a grammar probabilistically generates the output sentence. A jointsemantic-syntactic parser is derived that returns the $k$-best semantic andsyntactic parses for a given sentence. The semantic prior is flexible, and canbe used to incorporate background knowledge during parsing, in ways unlikeprevious semantic parsing approaches. For example, semantic statementscorresponding to beliefs in a knowledge base can be given higher priorprobability, type-correct statements can be given somewhat lower probability,and beliefs outside the knowledge base can be given lower probability. Theconstruction of our grammar invokes a novel application of hierarchicalDirichlet processes (HDPs), which in turn, requires a novel and efficientinference approach. We present experimental results showing, for a simplegrammar, that our parser outperforms a state-of-the-art CCG semantic parser andscales to knowledge bases with millions of beliefs.

Field-tunable quantum disordered ground state in the triangular lattice  antiferromagnet NaYbO$_2$

  Antiferromagnetically coupled S=1/2 spins on an isotropic triangular latticeis the paradigm of frustrated quantum magnetism, but structurally idealrealizations are rare. Here we investigate NaYbO$_2$, which hosts an idealtriangular lattice of $J_{eff}=1/2$ moments with no inherent site disorder. Nosignatures of conventional magnetic order appear down to 50 mK, stronglysuggesting a quantum spin liquid ground state. We observe a two-peak specificheat and a nearly quadratic temperature dependence in accord with expectationsfor a two-dimensional Dirac spin liquid. Application of a magnetic fieldstrongly perturbs the quantum disordered ground state and induces a cleartransition into a collinear ordered state consistent with a long-predictedup-up-down structure for a triangular lattice XXZ Hamiltonian driven by quantumfluctuations. The observation of spin liquid signatures in zero field andquantum-induced ordering in intermediate fields in the same compounddemonstrate an intrinsically quantum disordered ground state. We conclude thatNaYbO$_2$ is a model, versatile platform for exploring spin liquid physics withfull tunability of field and temperature.

Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation

  Current state-of-the-art NMT systems use large neural networks that are notonly slow to train, but also often require many heuristics and optimizationtricks, such as specialized learning rate schedules and large batch sizes. Thisis undesirable as it requires extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper,we propose a curriculum learning framework for NMT that reduces training time,reduces the need for specialized heuristics or large batch sizes, and resultsin overall better performance. Our framework consists of a principled way ofdeciding which training samples are shown to the model at different timesduring training, based on the estimated difficulty of a sample and the currentcompetence of the model. Filtering training samples in this manner prevents themodel from getting stuck in bad local optima, making it converge faster andreach a better solution than the common approach of uniformly sampling trainingexamples. Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily applied to existingNMT models by simply modifying their input data pipelines. We show that ourframework can help improve the training time and the performance of bothrecurrent neural network models and Transformers, achieving up to a 70%decrease in training time, while at the same time obtaining accuracyimprovements of up to 2.2 BLEU.
