Comparison of the COBE FIRAS and DIRBE Calibrations

  We compare the independent FIRAS and DIRBE observations from the COBE in the
wavelength range 100-300 microns. This cross calibration provides checks of
both data sets. The results show that the data sets are consistent within the
estimated gain and offset uncertainties of the two instruments. They show the
possibility of improving the gain and offset determination of DIRBE at 140 and
240 microns.


Computing Tropical Varieties

  The tropical variety of a $d$-dimensional prime ideal in a polynomial ring
with complex coefficients is a pure $d$-dimensional polyhedral fan. This fan is
shown to be connected in codimension one. We present algorithmic tools for
computing the tropical variety, and we discuss our implementation of these
tools in the Gr\"obner fan software \texttt{Gfan}. Every ideal is shown to have
a finite tropical basis, and a sharp lower bound is given for the size of a
tropical basis for an ideal of linear forms.


Vortices Clustering: The Origin of the Second Peak in the Magnetisation
  Loops of High Temperature Superconductors

  We study vortex clustering in type II Superconductors. We demonstrate that
the ``second peak'' observed in magnetisation loops may be a dynamical effect
associated with a density driven instability of the vortex system. At the
microscopic level the instability shows up as the clustering of individual
vortices at (rare) preferential regions of the pinning potential. In the limit
of quasi-static ramping the instability is related to a phase transition in the
equilibrium vortex system.


On vector-valued characters for noncommutative function algebras

  Let A be a closed subalgebra of a C*-algebra, that is a closed algebra of
Hilbert space operators. We generalize to such operator algebras $A$ several
key theorems and concepts from the theory of classical function algebras. In
particular we consider several problems that arise when generalizing classical
function algebra results involving characters ((contractive) homomorphisms into
the scalars) on the algebra. For example, the Jensen inequality, the related
Bishop-Ito-Schreiber theorem, and the theory of Gleason parts. We will usually
replace characters (classical function algebra case) by D-characters, certain
completely contractive homomorphisms $\Phi : A \to D$, where D is a
C*-subalgebra of A. We also consider some D-valued variants of the classical
Gleason-Whitney theorem.


Exploring the anomaly in the interaction cross section and matter radius
  of 23O

  New measurements of the interaction cross sections of 22,23O at 900A MeV
performed at the GSI, Darmstadt are reported that address the unsolved puzzle
of the large cross section previously observed for 23O. The matter radii for
these oxygen isotopes extracted through a Glauber model analysis are in good
agreement with the new predictions of the ab initio coupled-cluster theory
reported here. They are consistent with a 22O+neutron description of 23O as
well.


NJL and QCD from String Theory

  We study a configuration of D-branes in string theory that is described at
low energies by a four-dimensional field theory with a dynamically broken
chiral symmetry. In a certain region of the parameter space of the brane
configuration the low-energy theory is a non-local generalization of the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. This vector model is exactly solvable at large
N_c and dynamically breaks chiral symmetry at arbitrarily weak 't Hooft
coupling. At strong coupling the dynamics is determined by the low-energy
theory on D-branes living in the near-horizon geometry of other branes. In a
different region of parameter space the brane construction gives rise to large
N_c QCD. Thus the D-brane system interpolates between NJL and QCD.


Influence of a carbon over-coat on the X-ray reflectance of XEUS mirrors

  We describe measurements of the X-ray reflectance in the range 2 to 10 keV of
samples representative of coated silicon wafers that are proposed for the
fabrication of the XEUS (X-ray Evolving Universe Spectrometer) mission. We
compare the reflectance of silicon samples coated with bare Pt, with that for
samples with an additional 10nm thick carbon over-coating. We demonstrate a
significant improvement in reflectance in the energy range ~1 to 4 keV, and at
a grazing incidence angle of 10 mrad (0.57 degrees). We consider the resulting
effective area that could be attained with an optimized design of the XEUS
telescope. Typically an improvement of 10 to 60 % in effective area, depending
on photon energy, can be achieved using the carbon overcoat.


Stellar intensity interferometry: Experimental steps toward
  long-baseline observations

  Experiments are in progress to prepare for intensity interferometry with
arrays of air Cherenkov telescopes. At the Bonneville Seabase site, near Salt
Lake City, a testbed observatory has been set up with two 3-m air Cherenkov
telescopes on a 23-m baseline. Cameras are being constructed, with control
electronics for either off- or online analysis of the data. At the Lund
Observatory (Sweden), in Technion (Israel) and at the University of Utah (USA),
laboratory intensity interferometers simulating stellar observations have been
set up and experiments are in progress, using various analog and digital
correlators, reaching 1.4 ns time resolution, to analyze signals from pairs of
laboratory telescopes.


Spectral Evolution in High Redshift Quasars from the Final BOSS Sample

  We report on the diversity in quasar spectra from the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey. After filtering the spectra to mitigate selection effects
and Malmquist bias associated with a nearly flux-limited sample, we create high
signal-to-noise ratio composite spectra from 58,656 quasars (2.1 \le z \le
3.5), binned by luminosity, spectral index, and redshift. With these composite
spectra, we confirm the traditional Baldwin effect (BE, i.e., the
anticorrelation of C IV equivalent width (EW) and luminosity) that follows the
relation W_\lambda \propto L^{\beta_w} with slope \beta_w = -0.35 \pm 0.004,
-0.35 \pm 0.005, and -0.41 \pm 0.005 for z = 2.25, 2.46, and 2.84,
respectively. In addition to the redshift evolution in the slope of the BE, we
find redshift evolution in average quasar spectral features at fixed
luminosity. The spectroscopic signature of the redshift evolution is correlated
at 98% with the signature of varying luminosity, indicating that they arise
from the same physical mechanism. At a fixed luminosity, the average C IV FWHM
decreases with increasing redshift and is anti-correlated with C IV EW. The
spectroscopic signature associated with C IV FWHM suggests that the trends in
luminosity and redshift are likely caused by a superposition of effects that
are related to black hole mass and Eddington ratio. The redshift evolution is
the consequence of a changing balance between these two quantities as quasars
evolve toward a population with lower typical accretion rates at a given black
hole mass.


Stellar Intensity Interferometry: Imaging capabilities of air Cherenkov
  telescope arrays

  Sub milli-arcsecond imaging in the visible band will provide a new
perspective in stellar astrophysics. Even though stellar intensity
interferometry was abandoned more than 40 years ago, it is capable of imaging
and thus accomplishing more than the measurement of stellar diameters as was
previously thought. Various phase retrieval techniques can be used to
reconstruct actual images provided a sufficient coverage of the interferometric
plane is available. Planned large arrays of Air Cherenkov telescopes will
provide thousands of simultaneously available baselines ranging from a few tens
of meters to over a kilometer, thus making imaging possible with unprecedented
angular resolution. Here we investigate the imaging capabilities of arrays such
as CTA or AGIS used as Stellar Intensity Interferometry receivers. The study
makes use of simulated data as could realistically be obtained from these
arrays. A Cauchy-Riemann based phase recovery allows the reconstruction of
images which can be compared to the pristine image for which the data were
simulated. This is first done for uniform disk stars with different radii and
corresponding to various exposure times, and we find that the uncertainty in
reconstructing radii is a few percent after a few hours of exposure time.
Finally, more complex images are considered, showing that imaging at the
sub-milli-arc-second scale is possible.


KELT-11b: A Highly Inflated Sub-Saturn Exoplanet Transiting the V=8
  Subgiant HD 93396

  We report the discovery of a transiting exoplanet, KELT-11b, orbiting the
bright ($V=8.0$) subgiant HD 93396. A global analysis of the system shows that
the host star is an evolved subgiant star with $T_{\rm eff} = 5370\pm51$ K,
$M_{*} = 1.438_{-0.052}^{+0.061} M_{\odot}$, $R_{*} = 2.72_{-0.17}^{+0.21}
R_{\odot}$, log $g_*= 3.727_{-0.046}^{+0.040}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.180\pm0.075$.
The planet is a low-mass gas giant in a $P = 4.736529\pm0.00006$ day orbit,
with $M_{P} = 0.195\pm0.018 M_J$, $R_{P}= 1.37_{-0.12}^{+0.15} R_J$, $\rho_{P}
= 0.093_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$, surface gravity log ${g_{P}} =
2.407_{-0.086}^{+0.080}$, and equilibrium temperature $T_{eq} =
1712_{-46}^{+51}$ K. KELT-11 is the brightest known transiting exoplanet host
in the southern hemisphere by more than a magnitude, and is the 6th brightest
transit host to date. The planet is one of the most inflated planets known,
with an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height (2763 km), and an
associated size of the expected atmospheric transmission signal of 5.6%. These
attributes make the KELT-11 system a valuable target for follow-up and
atmospheric characterization, and it promises to become one of the benchmark
systems for the study of inflated exoplanets.


TESS Discovery of an ultra-short-period planet around the nearby M dwarf
  LHS 3844

  Data from the newly-commissioned \textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite} (TESS) has revealed a "hot Earth" around LHS 3844, an M dwarf
located 15 pc away. The planet has a radius of $1.32\pm 0.02$ $R_\oplus$ and
orbits the star every 11 hours. Although the existence of an atmosphere around
such a strongly irradiated planet is questionable, the star is bright enough
($I=11.9$, $K=9.1$) for this possibility to be investigated with transit and
occultation spectroscopy. The star's brightness and the planet's short period
will also facilitate the measurement of the planet's mass through Doppler
spectroscopy.


KELT-20b: A giant planet with a period of P~ 3.5 days transiting the V~
  7.6 early A star HD 185603

  We report the discovery of KELT-20b, a hot Jupiter transiting a V~7.6 early A
star with an orbital period of P~3.47 days. We identified the initial transit
signal in KELT-North survey data. Archival and follow-up photometry, the Gaia
parallax, radial velocities, Doppler tomography, and adaptive optics imaging
were used to confirm the planetary nature of the companion and characterize the
system. From global modeling we infer that the host star HD 185603 is a
rapidly-rotating (VsinI~120 km/s) A2V star with an effective temperature of
$T_{eff}$=8730K, mass of $M_{star}=1.76M_{sun}$, radius of
$R_{star}=1.561R_{sun}$, surface gravity of logg=4.292, and age of <600 Myr.
The planetary companion has a radius of $1.735^{+0.070}_{-0.075}~R_{J}$, a
semimajor axis of $a=0.0542^{+0.0014}_{-0.0021}$AU, and a linear ephemeris of
$BJD_{TDB}=2457503.120049 \pm 0.000190 + E(3.4741070\pm0.0000019)$. We place a
$3\sigma$ upper limit of ~3.5 $M_{J}$ on the mass of the planet. The Doppler
tomographic measurement indicates that the planetary orbit is well aligned with
the projected spin-axis of the star ($\lambda= 3.4\pm {2.1}$ degrees). The
inclination of the star is constrained to be $24.4<I_*<155.6$ degrees, implying
a true (three-dimensional) spin-orbit alignment of $1.3<\psi<69.8$ degrees. The
planet receives an insolation flux of $\sim 8\times 10^9~{\rm
erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, implying an equilibrium temperature of of ~ 2250 K,
assuming zero albedo and complete heat redistribution. Due to the high stellar
$T_{eff}$, the planet also receives an ultraviolet (wavelengths $d\le 91.2$~nm)
insolation flux of $\sim 9.1\times 10^4~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, which may
lead to significant ablation of the planetary atmosphere. Together with
WASP-33, Kepler-13 A, HAT-P-57, KELT-17, and KELT-9, KELT-20 is the sixth A
star host of a transiting giant planet, and the third-brightest host (in V) of
a transiting planet.


Search for the Rare Decays KL->pi0pi0mu+mu- and
  KL->pi0pi0X0->pi0pi0mu+mu-

  The KTeV E799 experiment has conducted a search for the rare decays
KL->pi0pi0mu+mu- and KL->pi0pi0X0->pi0pi0mu+mu-, where the X0 is a possible new
neutral boson that was reported by the HyperCP experiment with a mass of (214.3
pm 0.5) MeV/c^{2}. We find no evidence for either decay. We obtain upper limits
of Br(KL->pi0pi0X0->pi0pi0mu+mu-) < 1.0 x 10^{-10} and Br(KL->pi0pi0mu+mu-) <
9.2 x 10^{-11} at the 90% confidence level. This result rules out the
pseudoscalar X0 as an explanation of the HyperCP result under the scenario that
the \bar{d}sX0 coupling is completely real.


KELT-1b: A Strongly Irradiated, Highly Inflated, Short Period, 27
  Jupiter-mass Companion Transiting a mid-F Star

  We present the discovery of KELT-1b, the first transiting low-mass companion
from the wide-field Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope-North (KELT-North)
survey. The V=10.7 primary is a mildly evolved, solar-metallicity, mid-F star.
The companion is a low-mass brown dwarf or super-massive planet with mass of
27.23+/-0.50 MJ and radius of 1.110+0.037-0.024 RJ, on a very short period
(P=1.21750007) circular orbit. KELT-1b receives a large amount of stellar
insolation, with an equilibrium temperature assuming zero albedo and perfect
redistribution of 2422 K. Upper limits on the secondary eclipse depth indicate
that either the companion must have a non-zero albedo, or it must experience
some energy redistribution. Comparison with standard evolutionary models for
brown dwarfs suggests that the radius of KELT-1b is significantly inflated.
Adaptive optics imaging reveals a candidate stellar companion to KELT-1, which
is consistent with an M dwarf if bound. The projected spin-orbit alignment
angle is consistent with zero stellar obliquity, and the vsini of the primary
is consistent with tidal synchronization. Given the extreme parameters of the
KELT-1 system, we expect it to provide an important testbed for theories of the
emplacement and evolution of short-period companions, and theories of tidal
dissipation and irradiated brown dwarf atmospheres.


The Composite Spectrum of BOSS Quasars Selected for Studies of the
  Lyman-alpha Forest

  The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) has collected more than
150,000 $2.1 \leq z \leq 3.5$ quasar spectra since 2009. Using this
unprecedented sample, we create a composite spectrum in the rest-frame of
102,150 quasar spectra from 800 \AA\ to 3300 \AA\ at a signal-to-noise ratio
close to 1000 per pixel ($\Delta v$ of 69 km~s$^{-1}$). Included in this
analysis is a correction to account for flux calibration residuals in the BOSS
spectrophotometry. We determine the spectral index as a function of redshift of
the full sample, warp the composite spectrum to match the median spectral
index, and compare the resulting spectrum to SDSS photometry used in target
selection. The quasar composite matches the color of the quasar population to
within 0.02 magnitudes in $g-r$, 0.03 magnitudes in $r-i$, and 0.01 magnitudes
in $i-z$ over the redshift range $2.2<z<2.6$. The composite spectrum deviates
from the imaging photometry by 0.05 magnitudes around $z = 2.7$, likely due to
differences in target selection as the quasar colors become similar to the
stellar locus at this redshift. Finally, we characterize the line features in
the high signal-to-noise composite and identify nine faint lines not found in
the previous composite spectrum from SDSS.


HD 213885b: A transiting 1-day-period super-Earth with an Earth-like
  composition around a bright ($V=7.9$) star unveiled by TESS

  We report the discovery of the 1.008-day, ultra-short period (USP)
super-Earth HD 213885b (TOI-141b) orbiting the bright ($V=7.9$) star HD 213885
(TOI-141, TIC 403224672), detected using photometry from the recently launched
\textit{TESS} mission. Using FEROS, HARPS and CORALIE radial-velocities, we
measure a precise mass of $8.83^{+0.66}_{-0.65}$ $M_\oplus$ for this
$1.745^{+0.051}_{-0.052}$ $R_\oplus$ exoplanet, which provides enough
information to constrain its bulk composition, which is similar to Earth's
composition but enriched in iron. The radius, mass and stellar irradiation of
HD 213885b are almost indistinguishable from that of 55 Cancri e, making this
exoplanet its first "twin" in terms of its physical properties --- HD 213885b,
however, appears to be denser ($9.15^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ gr cm$^{-3}$) than 55
Cancri e. Our precise radial-velocities reveal an additional $4.78$-day signal
which we interpret as arising from a second, non-transiting planet in the
system, HD 213885c (TOI-141c), which has a minimum mass of
$19.95^{+1.38}_{-1.36}$ $M_\oplus$ and thus is consistent with being a
Neptune-mass exoplanet. The HD 213885 system is very interesting from the
perspective of future atmospheric characterization, being the second brightest
star to host an ultra-short period transiting super-Earth (with the brightest
star being, in fact, 55 Cancri). Prospects for characterization with present
and future observatories are discussed.


KELT-16b: A highly irradiated, ultra-short period hot Jupiter nearing
  tidal disruption

  We announce the discovery of KELT-16b, a highly irradiated, ultra-short
period hot Jupiter transiting the relatively bright ($V = 11.7$) star TYC
2688-1839-1. A global analysis of the system shows KELT-16 to be an F7V star
with $T_\textrm{eff} = 6236\pm54$ K, $\log{g_\star} = 4.253_{-0.036}^{+0.031}$,
[Fe/H] = -0.002$_{-0.085}^{+0.086}$, $M_\star = 1.211_{-0.046}^{+0.043}
M_\odot$, and $R_\star = 1.360_{-0.053}^{+0.064} R_\odot$. The planet is a
relatively high mass inflated gas giant with $M_\textrm{P} =
2.75_{-0.15}^{+0.16} M_\textrm{J}$, $R_\textrm{P} = 1.415_{-0.067}^{+0.084}
R_\textrm{J}$, density $\rho_\textrm{P} = 1.20\pm0.18$ g cm$^{-3}$, surface
gravity $\log{g_\textrm{P}} = 3.530_{-0.049}^{+0.042}$, and $T_\textrm{eq} =
2453_{-47}^{+55}$ K. The best-fitting linear ephemeris is $T_\textrm{C} =
2457247.24791\pm0.00019$ BJD$_{tdb}$ and $P = 0.9689951 \pm 0.0000024$ d.
KELT-16b joins WASP-18b, -19b, -43b, -103b, and HATS-18b as the only giant
transiting planets with $P < 1$ day. Its ultra-short period and high
irradiation make it a benchmark target for atmospheric studies by HST, Spitzer,
and eventually JWST. For example, as a hotter, higher mass analog of WASP-43b,
KELT-16b may feature an atmospheric temperature-pressure inversion and
day-to-night temperature swing extreme enough for TiO to rain out at the
terminator. KELT-16b could also join WASP-43b in extending tests of the
observed mass-metallicity relation of the Solar System gas giants to higher
masses. KELT-16b currently orbits at a mere $\sim$ 1.7 Roche radii from its
host star, and could be tidally disrupted in as little as a few $\times 10^{5}$
years (for a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q_*' = 10^5$). Finally, the
likely existence of a widely separated bound stellar companion in the KELT-16
system makes it possible that Kozai-Lidov oscillations played a role in driving
KELT-16b inward to its current precarious orbit.


Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project VI:
  reverberating Disk Models for NGC 5548

  We conduct a multiwavelength continuum variability study of the Seyfert 1
galaxy NGC 5548 to investigate the temperature structure of its accretion disk.
The 19 overlapping continuum light curves (1158 to 9157 angstroms) combine
simultaneous HST , Swift , and ground-based observations over a 180 day period
from 2014 January to July. Light-curve variability is interpreted as the
reverberation response of the accretion disk to irradiation by a central
time-varying point source. Our model yields the disk inclination, i,
temperature T1 at 1 light day from the black hole, and a temperature-radius
slope, alpha. We also infer the driving light curve and find that it correlates
poorly with both the hard and soft X-ray light curves, suggesting that the
X-rays alone may not drive the ultraviolet and optical variability over the
observing period. We also decompose the light curves into bright, faint, and
mean accretion-disk spectra. These spectra lie below that expected for a
standard blackbody accretion disk accreting at L/LEdd = 0.1


KELT-18b: Puffy Planet, Hot Host, Probably Perturbed

  We report the discovery of KELT-18b, a transiting hot Jupiter in a 2.87d
orbit around the bright (V=10.1), hot, F4V star BD+60 1538 (TYC 3865-1173-1).
We present follow-up photometry, spectroscopy, and adaptive optics imaging that
allow a detailed characterization of the system. Our preferred model fits yield
a host stellar temperature of 6670+/-120 K and a mass of 1.524+/-0.069 Msun,
situating it as one of only a handful of known transiting planets with hosts
that are as hot, massive, and bright. The planet has a mass of 1.18+/-0.11
Mjup, a radius of 1.57+/-0.04 Rjup, and a density of 0.377+/-0.040 g/cm^3,
making it one of the most inflated planets known around a hot star. We argue
that KELT-18b's high temperature and low surface gravity, which yield an
estimated ~600 km atmospheric scale height, combined with its hot, bright host
make it an excellent candidate for observations aimed at atmospheric
characterization. We also present evidence for a bound stellar companion at a
projected separation of ~1100 AU, and speculate that it may have contributed to
the strong misalignment we suspect between KELT-18's spin axis and its planet's
orbital axis. The inferior conjunction time is 2457542.524998 +/-0.000416
(BJD_TDB) and the orbital period is 2.8717510 +/- 0.0000029 days. We encourage
Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements in the near future to confirm the suspected
spin-orbit misalignment of this system.


A Single Circumbinary Disk in the HD 98800 Quadruple System

  We present sub-arcsecond thermal infrared imaging of HD 98800, a young
quadruple system composed of a pair of low-mass spectroscopic binaries
separated by 0.8'' (38 AU), each with a K-dwarf primary. Images at wavelengths
ranging from 5 to 24.5 microns show unequivocally that the optically fainter
binary, HD 98800B, is the sole source of a comparatively large infrared excess
upon which a silicate emission feature is superposed. The excess is detected
only at wavelengths of 7.9 microns and longer, peaks at 25 microns, and has a
best-fit black-body temperature of 150 K, indicating that most of the dust lies
at distances greater than the orbital separation of the spectroscopic binary.
We estimate the radial extent of the dust with a disk model that approximates
radiation from the spectroscopic binary as a single source of equivalent
luminosity. Given the data, the most-likely values of disk properties in the
ranges considered are R_in = 5.0 +/- 2.5 AU, DeltaR = 13+/-8 AU, lambda_0 =
2(+4/-1.5) microns, gamma = 0+/-2.5, and sigma_total = 16+/-3 AU^2, where R_in
is the inner radius, DeltaR is the radial extent of the disk, lambda_0 is the
effective grain size, gamma is the radial power-law exponent of the optical
depth, tau, and sigma_total is the total cross-section of the grains. The range
of implied disk masses is 0.001--0.1 times that of the moon. These results show
that, for a wide range of possible disk properties, a circumbinary disk is far
more likely than a narrow ring.


Kepler-1647b: the largest and longest-period Kepler transiting
  circumbinary planet

  We report the discovery of a new Kepler transiting circumbinary planet (CBP).
This latest addition to the still-small family of CBPs defies the current trend
of known short-period planets orbiting near the stability limit of binary
stars. Unlike the previous discoveries, the planet revolving around the
eclipsing binary system Kepler-1647 has a very long orbital period (~1100 days)
and was at conjunction only twice during the Kepler mission lifetime. Due to
the singular configuration of the system, Kepler-1647b is not only the
longest-period transiting CBP at the time of writing, but also one of the
longest-period transiting planets. With a radius of 1.06+/-0.01 RJup it is also
the largest CBP to date. The planet produced three transits in the light-curve
of Kepler-1647 (one of them during an eclipse, creating a syzygy) and
measurably perturbed the times of the stellar eclipses, allowing us to measure
its mass to be 1.52+/-0.65 MJup. The planet revolves around an 11-day period
eclipsing binary consisting of two Solar-mass stars on a slightly inclined,
mildly eccentric (e_bin = 0.16), spin-synchronized orbit. Despite having an
orbital period three times longer than Earth's, Kepler-1647b is in the
conservative habitable zone of the binary star throughout its orbit.


KELT-7b: A hot Jupiter transiting a bright V=8.54 rapidly rotating
  F-star

  We report the discovery of KELT-7b, a transiting hot Jupiter with a mass of
$1.28 \pm 0.18$ MJ, radius of $1.53_{-0.047}^{+0.046}$ RJ, and an orbital
period of $2.7347749 \pm 0.0000039$ days. The bright host star (HD33643;
KELT-7) is an F-star with $V=8.54$, Teff $=6789_{-49}^{+50}$ K, [Fe/H]
$=0.139_{-0.081}^{+0.075}$, and $\log{g}=4.149 \pm 0.019$. It has a mass of
$1.535_{-0.054}^{+0.066}$ Msun, a radius of $1.732_{-0.045}^{+0.043}$ Rsun, and
is the fifth most massive, fifth hottest, and the ninth brightest star known to
host a transiting planet. It is also the brightest star around which KELT has
discovered a transiting planet. Thus, KELT-7b is an ideal target for detailed
characterization given its relatively low surface gravity, high equilibrium
temperature, and bright host star. The rapid rotation of the star ($73 \pm 0.5$
km/s) results in a Rossiter-McLaughlin effect with an unusually large amplitude
of several hundred m/s. We find that the orbit normal of the planet is likely
to be well-aligned with the stellar spin axis, with a projected spin-orbit
alignment of $\lambda=9.7 \pm 5.2$ degrees. This is currently the second most
rapidly rotating star to have a reflex signal (and thus mass determination) due
to a planetary companion measured.


A Bright Short Period M-M Eclipsing Binary from the KELT Survey:
  Magnetic Activity and the Mass-Radius Relationship for M-dwarfs

  We report the discovery of KELT J041621-620046, a moderately bright
(J$\sim$10.2) M dwarf eclipsing binary system at a distance of 39$\pm$3 pc.
KELT J041621-620046 was first identified as an eclipsing binary using
observations from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey. The
system has a short orbital period of $\sim$1.11 days and consists of components
with M$_1$ = $0.447^{-0.047}_{+0.052}\,M_\odot$ and M$_2$ =
$0.399^{-0.042}_{+0.046}\,M_\odot$ in nearly circular orbits. The radii of the
two stars are R$_1$ = $0.540^{-0.032}_{+0.034}\,R_\odot$ and R$_2$ =
$0.453\pm0.017\,R_\odot$. Full system and orbital properties were determined
(to $\sim$10% error) by conducting an EBOP global modeling of the high
precision photometric and spectroscopic observations obtained by the KELT
Follow-up Network. Each star is larger by 17-28% and cooler by 4-10% than
predicted by standard (non-magnetic) stellar models. Strong H$\alpha$ emission
indicates chromospheric activity in both stars. The observed radii and
temperature discrepancies for both components are more consistent with those
predicted by empirical relations that account for convective suppression due to
magnetic activity.


Emission Line Properties of Seyfert Galaxies in the 12 Micron Sample

  We present spectroscopy of emission lines for 81 Seyfert 1 and 104 Seyfert 2
galaxies in the IRAS 12$\mu$m galaxy sample. We analyzed the emission-line
luminosity functions, reddening, and other gas diagnostics. The narrow-line
regions (NLR) of Sy1 and 2 galaxies do not significantly differ from each other
in most of these diagnostics. Combining the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio with a new
reddening indicator-the [SII]6720/[OII]3727 ratio, we find the average
$E(B-V)=0.49\pm0.35$ for Sy1s and $0.52\pm0.26$ for Sy2s. The NLR of Sy1
galaxies has only marginally higher ionization than the Sy2s. Our sample
includes 22 Sy1.9s and 1.8s. In their narrow lines, these low-luminosity
Seyferts are more similar to the Sy2s than the Sy1s. We construct a BPT
diagram, and include the Sy1.8s and 1.9s. They overlap the region occupied by
the Sy2s. The C IV equivalent width correlates more strongly with [O
III]/H$\beta$ than with UV luminosity. The Sy1 and Sy2 luminosity functions of
[OII]3727 and [OIII]5007 are indistinguishable. Unlike the LF's of Seyfert
galaxies measured by SDSS, ours are nearly flat at low L. The larger number of
faint Sloan "AGN" is attributable to their inclusion of weakly emitting LINERs
and H II+AGN "composite" nuclei, which do not meet our classification criteria
for Seyferts. An Appendix investigates which emission line luminosities provide
the most reliable measures of the total non-stellar luminosity. The hard X-ray
or near-ultraviolet continuum luminosity can be crudely predicted from either
the [O III]5007 luminosity, or the combination of [O III]+H$\beta$, or [N
II]+H$\alpha$ lines, with a scatter of $\pm\,4$ times for the Sy1s and
$\pm\,10$ times for the Sy2s. The latter two hybrid (NLR+BLR) indicators have
the advantage of predicting the same HX luminosity independent of Seyfert type.


The KELT Follow-Up Network and Transit False Positive Catalog:
  Pre-vetted False Positives for TESS

  The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project has been conducting
a photometric survey for transiting planets orbiting bright stars for over ten
years. The KELT images have a pixel scale of ~23"/pixel---very similar to that
of NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)---as well as a large
point spread function, and the KELT reduction pipeline uses a weighted
photometric aperture with radius 3'. At this angular scale, multiple stars are
typically blended in the photometric apertures. In order to identify false
positives and confirm transiting exoplanets, we have assembled a follow-up
network (KELT-FUN) to conduct imaging with higher spatial resolution, cadence,
and photometric precision than the KELT telescopes, as well as spectroscopic
observations of the candidate host stars. The KELT-FUN team has followed-up
over 1,600 planet candidates since 2011, resulting in more than 20 planet
discoveries. Excluding ~450 false alarms of non-astrophysical origin (i.e.,
instrumental noise or systematics), we present an all-sky catalog of the 1,128
bright stars (6<V<10) that show transit-like features in the KELT light curves,
but which were subsequently determined to be astrophysical false positives
(FPs) after photometric and/or spectroscopic follow-up observations. The
KELT-FUN team continues to pursue KELT and other planet candidates and will
eventually follow up certain classes of TESS candidates. The KELT FP catalog
will help minimize the duplication of follow-up observations by current and
future transit surveys such as TESS.


The Need for Laboratory Work to Aid in The Understanding of Exoplanetary
  Atmospheres

  Advancements in our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres, from massive
gas giants down to rocky worlds, depend on the constructive challenges between
observations and models. We are now on a clear trajectory for improvements in
exoplanet observations that will revolutionize our ability to characterize the
atmospheric structure, composition, and circulation of these worlds. These
improvements stem from significant investments in new missions and facilities,
such as JWST and the several planned ground-based extremely large telescopes.
However, while exoplanet science currently has a wide range of sophisticated
models that can be applied to the tide of forthcoming observations, the
trajectory for preparing these models for the upcoming observational challenges
is unclear. Thus, our ability to maximize the insights gained from the next
generation of observatories is not certain. In many cases, uncertainties in a
path towards model advancement stems from insufficiencies in the laboratory
data that serve as critical inputs to atmospheric physical and chemical tools.
We outline a number of areas where laboratory or ab initio investigations could
fill critical gaps in our ability to model exoplanet atmospheric opacities,
clouds, and chemistry. Specifically highlighted are needs for: (1) molecular
opacity linelists with parameters for a diversity of broadening gases, (2)
extended databases for collision-induced absorption and dimer opacities, (3)
high spectral resolution opacity data for relevant molecular species, (4)
laboratory studies of haze and condensate formation and optical properties, (5)
significantly expanded databases of chemical reaction rates, and (6)
measurements of gas photo-absorption cross sections at high temperatures. We
hope that by meeting these needs, we can make the next two decades of exoplanet
science as productive and insightful as the previous two decades. (abr)


KELT-17b: A hot-Jupiter transiting an A-star in a misaligned orbit
  detected with Doppler tomography

  We present the discovery of a hot-Jupiter transiting the V=9.23 mag
main-sequence A-star KELT-17 (BD+14 1881). KELT-17b is a 1.31 -0.29/+0.28 Mj,
1.525 -0.060/+0.065 Rj hot-Jupiter in a 3.08 day period orbit misaligned at
-115.9 +/- 4.1 deg to the rotation axis of the star. The planet is confirmed
via both the detection of the radial velocity orbit, and the Doppler
tomographic detection of the shadow of the planet over two transits. The nature
of the spin-orbit misaligned transit geometry allows us to place a constraint
on the level of differential rotation in the host star; we find that KELT-17 is
consistent with both rigid-body rotation and solar differential rotation rates
(alpha < 0.30 at 2 sigma significance). KELT-17 is only the fourth A-star with
a confirmed transiting planet, and with a mass of 1.635 -0.061/+0.066 Msun,
effective temperature of 7454 +/- 49 K, and projected rotational velocity v sin
I_* = 44.2 -1.3/+1.5 km/s; it is amongst the most massive, hottest, and most
rapidly rotating of known planet hosts.


Photometry and spectroscopy of GRB 060526: A detailed study of the
  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst

  Aims: With this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglow
light curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060526 at $z=3.221$.
Methods: We present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for a
GRB afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultraviolet
to the near infrared. The data set contains 412 data points in total to which
we add additional data from the literature. Furthermore, we present
low-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. The afterglow
light curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power law
fits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.
The absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive column
densities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis from
which we derive the metallicity of the host of GRB 060526. Results: The
temporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law with
breaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. It shows deviations
from the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energy
injections from the central engine, although some significant microvariability
remains. The broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows no
significant extinction along the line of sight. The metallicity derived from
\ion{S}{II} and \ion{Fe}{II} of [S/H] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [Fe/H] =
--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparable
to the metallicity of other GRB hosts at similar redshifts. At the position of
the afterglow, no host is detected to F775W(AB) = 28.5 mag with the HST,
implying an absolute magnitude of the host M(1500 \AA{})$>$--18.3 mag which is
fainter than most long-duration hosts, although the GRB may be associated with
a faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.


Reconstructing Extreme Space Weather from Planet Hosting Stars

  The field of exoplanetary science is making rapid progress both in
statistical studies of exoplanet properties as well as in individual
characterization. As space missions provide an emerging picture of formation
and evolution of exoplanetary systems, the search for habitable worlds becomes
one of the fundamental issues to address. To tackle such a complex challenge,
we need to specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development and
sustainment of life as we know it. This requires the understanding of global
(astrospheric) and local (atmospheric, surface and internal) environments of
exoplanets in the framework of the physical processes of the interaction
between evolving planet-hosting stars along with exoplanetary evolution over
geological timescales, and the resulting impact on climate and habitability of
exoplanets. Feedbacks between astrophysical, physico-chemical atmospheric and
geological processes can only be understood through interdisciplinary studies
with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary,
Earth sciences, astrobiology, and the origin of life communities. The
assessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of
terrestrial (exo)planets and potential exomoons around them may significantly
modify the extent and the location of the habitable zone and provide new
directions for searching for signatures of life. Thus, characterization of
stellar ionizing outputs becomes an important task for further understanding
the extent of habitability in the universe. The goal of this white paper is to
identify and describe promising key research goals to aid the theoretical
characterization and observational detection of ionizing radiation from
quiescent and flaring upper atmospheres of planet hosts as well as properties
of stellar coronal mass ejections and stellar energetic particle events.


KELT-10b: The First Transiting Exoplanet from the KELT-South Survey -- A
  Hot Sub-Jupiter Transiting a V = 10.7 Early G-Star

  We report the discovery of KELT-10b, the first transiting exoplanet
discovered using the KELT-South telescope. KELT-10b is a highly inflated
sub-Jupiter mass planet transiting a relatively bright $V = 10.7$ star (TYC
8378-64-1), with T$_{eff}$ = $5948\pm74$ K, $\log{g}$ =
$4.319_{-0.030}^{+0.020}$ and [Fe/H] = $0.09_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$, an inferred mass
M$_{*}$ = $1.112_{-0.061}^{+0.055}$ M$_{\odot}$ and radius R$_{*}$ =
$1.209_{-0.035}^{+0.047}$ R$_{\odot}$. The planet has a radius R$_{P}$ =
$1.399_{-0.049}^{+0.069}$ R$_{J}$ and mass M$_{P}$ = $0.679_{-0.038}^{+0.039}$
M$_{J}$. The planet has an eccentricity consistent with zero and a semi-major
axis $a$ = $0.05250_{-0.00097}^{+0.00086}$ AU. The best fitting linear
ephemeris is $T_{0}$ = 2457066.72045$\pm$0.00027 BJD$_{TDB}$ and P =
4.1662739$\pm$0.0000063 days. This planet joins a group of highly inflated
transiting exoplanets with a radius much larger and a mass much less than those
of Jupiter. The planet, which boasts deep transits of 1.4%, has a relatively
high equilibrium temperature of T$_{eq}$ = $1377_{-23}^{+28}$ K, assuming zero
albedo and perfect heat redistribution. KELT-10b receives an estimated
insolation of $0.817_{-0.054}^{+0.068}$ $\times$ 10$^9$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,
which places it far above the insolation threshold above which hot Jupiters
exhibit increasing amounts of radius inflation. Evolutionary analysis of the
host star suggests that KELT-10b is unlikely to survive beyond the current
subgiant phase, due to a concomitant in-spiral of the planet over the next
$\sim$1 Gyr. The planet transits a relatively bright star and exhibits the
third largest transit depth of all transiting exoplanets with V $<$ 11 in the
southern hemisphere, making it a promising candidate for future atmospheric
characterization studies.


KELT-14b and KELT-15b: An Independent Discovery of WASP-122b and a New
  Hot Jupiter

  We report the discovery of KELT-14b and KELT-15b, two hot Jupiters from the
KELT-South survey. KELT-14b, an independent discovery of the recently announced
WASP-122b, is an inflated Jupiter mass planet that orbits a
$\sim5.0^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$ Gyr, $V$ = 11.0, G2 star that is near the main sequence
turnoff. The host star, KELT-14 (TYC 7638-981-1), has an inferred mass
$M_{*}$=$1.18_{-0.07}^{+0.05}$$M_{\odot}$ and radius
$R_{*}$=$1.37\pm{-0.08}$$R_{\odot}$, and has $T_{eff}$=$5802_{-92}^{+95}$K,
$\log{g_*}$=$4.23_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ and =$0.33\pm{0.09}$. The planet orbits with
a period of $1.7100588 \pm 0.0000025$ days ($T_{0}$=2457091.02863$\pm$0.00047)
and has a radius R$_{p}$=$1.52_{-0.11}^{+0.12}$$R_{J}$ and mass
M$_{p}$=$1.196\pm0.072$$M_{J}$, and the eccentricity is consistent with zero.
KELT-15b is another inflated Jupiter mass planet that orbits a $\sim$
$4.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ Gyr, $V$ = 11.2, G0 star (TYC 8146-86-1) that is near the
"blue hook" stage of evolution prior to the Hertzsprung gap, and has an
inferred mass $M_{*}$=$1.181_{-0.050}^{+0.051}$$M_{\odot}$ and radius
$R_{*}$=$1.48_{-0.04}^{+0.09}$$R_{\odot}$, and $T_{eff}$=$6003_{-52}^{+56}$K,
$\log{g_*}$=$4.17_{-0.04}^{+0.02}$ and [Fe/H]=$0.05\pm0.03$. The planet orbits
on a period of $3.329441 \pm 0.000016$ days ($T_{0}$ = 2457029.1663$\pm$0.0073)
and has a radius R$_{p}$=$1.443_{-0.057}^{+0.11}$$R_{J}$ and mass
M$_{p}$=$0.91_{-0.22}^{+0.21}$$M_{J}$ and an eccentricity consistent with zero.
KELT-14b has the second largest expected emission signal in the K-band for
known transiting planets brighter than $K<10.5$. Both KELT-14b and KELT-15b are
predicted to have large enough emission signals that their secondary eclipses
should be detectable using ground-based observatories.


KELT-12b: A $P \sim 5$ Day, Highly Inflated Hot Jupiter Transiting a
  Mildly Evolved Hot Star

  We report the discovery of KELT-12b, a highly inflated Jupiter-mass planet
transiting a mildly evolved host star. We identified the initial transit signal
in the KELT-North survey data and established the planetary nature of the
companion through precise follow-up photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy,
precise radial velocity measurements, and high-resolution adaptive optics
imaging. Our preferred best-fit model indicates that the $V = 10.64$ host, TYC
2619-1057-1, has $T_{\rm eff} = 6278 \pm 51$ K, $\log{g_\star} =
3.89^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$, and [Fe/H] = $0.19^{+0.083}_{-0.085}$, with an
inferred mass $M_{\star} = 1.59^{+0.071}_{-0.091} M_\odot$ and radius $R_\star
= 2.37 \pm 0.18 R_\odot$. The planetary companion has $M_{\rm P} = 0.95 \pm
0.14 M_{\rm J}$, $R_{\rm P} = 1.79^{+0.18}_{-0.17} R_{\rm J}$, $\log{g_{\rm P}}
= 2.87^{+0.097}_{-0.098}$, and density $\rho_{\rm P} = 0.21^{+0.075}_{-0.054}$
g cm$^{-3}$, making it one of the most inflated giant planets known. The time
of inferior conjunction in ${\rm BJD_{TDB}}$ is $2457088.692055 \pm 0.0009$ and
the period is $P = 5.0316144 \pm 0.0000306$ days. Despite the relatively large
separation of $\sim0.07$ AU implied by its $\sim 5.03$-day orbital period,
KELT-12b receives significant flux of $2.93^{+0.33}_{-0.30} \times 10^9$ erg
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ from its host. We compare the radii and insolations of
transiting gas-giant planets around hot ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 6250$ K) and cool
stars, noting that the observed paucity of known transiting giants around hot
stars with low insolation is likely due to selection effects. We underscore the
significance of long-term ground-based monitoring of hot stars and space-based
targeting of hot stars with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to
search for inflated giants in longer-period orbits.


KELT-19Ab: A P~4.6 Day Hot Jupiter Transiting a Likely Am Star with a
  Distant Stellar Companion

  We present the discovery of the giant planet KELT-19Ab, which transits the
moderately bright $(\mathrm{V} \sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with an
orbital period of 4.61 days. We confirm the planetary nature of the companion
via a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<
4.1\,\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which
indicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda =
-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\rm{T_{eff}}
=7500 \pm 110\,\mathrm{K}$ host star has $\mathrm{M_*} =
1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\mathrm{R_*} = 1.83 \pm
0.10\,\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $\mathrm{R_P}=1.91 \pm
0.11\,\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times
10^{9}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibrium
temperature of $\rm{T_{EQ}} = \sim 1935\,\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo and
complete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm
2.0\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared to
other stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced
in metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely an
Am star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transiting
planet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system reveal
the existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at a
projected separation of $\approx 160\,\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocity
measurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to
have stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slow
rotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely to
have caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced the
transiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.


KELT-22Ab: A Massive Hot Jupiter Transiting a Near Solar Twin

  We present the discovery of KELT-22Ab, a hot Jupiter from the KELT-South
survey. KELT-22Ab transits the moderately bright ($V\sim 11.1$) Sun-like G2V
star TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 1.3866529 \pm
0.0000027 $ days, a radius of $R_{P} = 1.285_{-0.071}^{+0.12}~R_{J}$, and a
relatively large mass of $M_{P} = 3.47_{-0.14}^{+0.15}~ M_{J}$. The star has
$R_{\star} = 1.099_{-0.046}^{+0.079}~ R_{\odot}$, $M_{\star} =
1.092_{-0.041}^{+0.045}~ M_{\odot}$, ${T_{\rm eff}\,} = 5767_{-49}^{+50}~$ K,
${\log{g_\star}} = 4.393_{-0.060}^{+0.039}~$ (cgs), and [m/H] =
$+0.259_{-0.083}^{+0.085}~$, and thus, other than its slightly super-solar
metallicity, appears to be a near solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibits
kinematics and a Galactic orbit that are somewhat atypical for thin disk stars.
Nevertheless, the star is rotating quite rapidly for its estimated age, shows
evidence of chromospheric activity, and is somewhat metal rich. Imaging reveals
a slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projected
separation of 6\arcsec ($\sim$1400 AU). In addition to the orbital motion
caused by the transiting planet, we detect a possible linear trend in the
radial velocity of KELT-22A suggesting the presence of another relatively
nearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as a
consequence of the small semi-major axis of $a/R_{\star} = 4.97$), and is
mildly inflated. At such small separations, tidal forces become significant.
The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the rate of tidal
dissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces,
the semi-major axis of KELT-22Ab is decreasing rapidly, and is thus predicted
to spiral into the star within the next Gyr.


KELT-6b: A P~7.9 d Hot Saturn Transiting a Metal-Poor Star with a
  Long-Period Companion

  We report the discovery of KELT-6b, a mildly-inflated Saturn-mass planet
transiting a metal-poor host. The initial transit signal was identified in
KELT-North survey data, and the planetary nature of the occulter was
established using a combination of follow-up photometry, high-resolution
imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and precise radial velocity
measurements. The fiducial model from a global analysis including constraints
from isochrones indicates that the V=10.38 host star (BD+31 2447) is a mildly
evolved, late-F star with T_eff=6102 \pm 43 K, log(g_*)=4.07_{-0.07}^{+0.04}
and [Fe/H]=-0.28 \pm 0.04, with an inferred mass M_*=1.09 \pm 0.04 M_sun and
radius R_star=1.58_{-0.09}^{+0.16} R_sun. The planetary companion has mass
M_P=0.43 \pm 0.05 M_J, radius R_P=1.19_{-0.08}^{+0.13} R_J, surface gravity
log(g_P)=2.86_{-0.08}^{+0.06}, and density rho_P=0.31_{-0.08}^{+0.07}
g~cm^{-3}. The planet is on an orbit with semimajor axis a=0.079 \pm 0.001 AU
and eccentricity e=0.22_{-0.10}^{+0.12}, which is roughly consistent with
circular, and has ephemeris of T_c(BJD_TDB)=2456347.79679 \pm 0.00036 and
P=7.845631 \pm 0.000046 d. Equally plausible fits that employ empirical
constraints on the host star parameters rather than isochrones yield a larger
planet mass and radius by ~4-7%. KELT-6b has surface gravity and incident flux
similar to HD209458b, but orbits a host that is more metal poor than HD209458
by ~0.3 dex. Thus, the KELT-6 system offers an opportunity to perform a
comparative measurement of two similar planets in similar environments around
stars of very different metallicities. The precise radial velocity data also
reveal an acceleration indicative of a longer-period third body in the system,
although the companion is not detected in Keck adaptive optics images.


KELT-8b: A highly inflated transiting hot Jupiter and a new technique
  for extracting high-precision radial velocities from noisy spectra

  We announce the discovery of a highly inflated transiting hot Jupiter
discovered by the KELT-North survey. A global analysis including constraints
from isochrones indicates that the V = 10.8 host star (HD 343246) is a mildly
evolved, G dwarf with $T_{\rm eff} = 5754_{-55}^{+54}$ K, $\log{g} =
4.078_{-0.054}^{+0.049}$, $[Fe/H] = 0.272\pm0.038$, an inferred mass
$M_{*}=1.211_{-0.066}^{+0.078}$ M$_{\odot}$, and radius
$R_{*}=1.67_{-0.12}^{+0.14}$ R$_{\odot}$. The planetary companion has mass $M_P
= 0.867_{-0.061}^{+0.065}$ $M_{J}$, radius $R_P = 1.86_{-0.16}^{+0.18}$
$R_{J}$, surface gravity $\log{g_{P}} = 2.793_{-0.075}^{+0.072}$, and density
$\rho_P = 0.167_{-0.038}^{+0.047}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The planet is on a roughly
circular orbit with semimajor axis $a = 0.04571_{-0.00084}^{+0.00096}$ AU and
eccentricity $e = 0.035_{-0.025}^{+0.050}$. The best-fit linear ephemeris is
$T_0 = 2456883.4803 \pm 0.0007$ BJD$_{\rm TDB}$ and $P = 3.24406 \pm 0.00016$
days. This planet is one of the most inflated of all known transiting
exoplanets, making it one of the few members of a class of extremely low
density, highly-irradiated gas giants. The low stellar $\log{g}$ and large
implied radius are supported by stellar density constraints from follow-up
light curves, plus an evolutionary and space motion analysis. We also develop a
new technique to extract high precision radial velocities from noisy spectra
that reduces the observing time needed to confirm transiting planet candidates.
This planet boasts deep transits of a bright star, a large inferred atmospheric
scale height, and a high equilibrium temperature of $T_{eq}=1675^{+61}_{-55}$
K, assuming zero albedo and perfect heat redistribution, making it one of the
best targets for future atmospheric characterization studies.


Planet Formation Imager (PFI): science vision and key requirements

  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) project aims to provide a strong scientific
vision for ground-based optical astronomy beyond the upcoming generation of
Extremely Large Telescopes. We make the case that a breakthrough in angular
resolution imaging capabilities is required in order to unravel the processes
involved in planet formation. PFI will be optimised to provide a complete
census of the protoplanet population at all stellocentric radii and over the
age range from 0.1 to about 100 Myr. Within this age period, planetary systems
undergo dramatic changes and the final architecture of planetary systems is
determined. Our goal is to study the planetary birth on the natural spatial
scale where the material is assembled, which is the "Hill Sphere" of the
forming planet, and to characterise the protoplanetary cores by measuring their
masses and physical properties. Our science working group has investigated the
observational characteristics of these young protoplanets as well as the
migration mechanisms that might alter the system architecture. We simulated the
imprints that the planets leave in the disk and study how PFI could
revolutionise areas ranging from exoplanet to extragalactic science. In this
contribution we outline the key science drivers of PFI and discuss the
requirements that will guide the technology choices, the site selection, and
potential science/technology tradeoffs.


KELT-4Ab: An inflated Hot Jupiter transiting the bright (V~10) component
  of a hierarchical triple

  We report the discovery of KELT-4Ab, an inflated, transiting Hot Jupiter
orbiting the brightest component of a hierarchical triple stellar system. The
host star is an F star with $T_{\rm eff}=6206\pm75$ K, $\log g=4.108\pm0.014$,
$\left[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}\right]=-0.116_{-0.069}^{+0.065}$, ${\rm
M_*}=1.201_{-0.061}^{+0.067} \ {\rm M}_{\odot}$, and ${\rm
R_*}=1.610_{-0.068}^{+0.078} \ {\rm R}_{\odot}$. The best-fit linear ephemeris
is $\rm {BJD_{TDB}} = 2456193.29157 \pm 0.00021 + E\left(2.9895936 \pm
0.0000048\right)$. With a magnitude of $V\sim10$, a planetary radius of
$1.699_{-0.045}^{+0.046} \ {\rm R_J}$, and a mass of $0.902_{-0.059}^{+0.060} \
{\rm M_J}$, it is the brightest host among the population of inflated Hot
Jupiters ($R_P > 1.5R_J$), making it a valuable discovery for probing the
nature of inflated planets. In addition, its existence within a hierarchical
triple and its proximity to Earth ($210$ pc) provides a unique opportunity for
dynamical studies with continued monitoring with high resolution imaging and
precision radial velocities. In particular, the motion of the binary stars
around each other and of both stars around the primary star relative to the
measured epoch in this work should be detectable when it rises in October 2015.


KELT-21b: A Hot Jupiter Transiting the Rapidly-Rotating Metal-Poor
  Late-A Primary of a Likely Hierarchical Triple System

  We present the discovery of KELT-21b, a hot Jupiter transiting the $V=10.5$
A8V star HD 332124. The planet has an orbital period of
$P=3.6127647\pm0.0000033$ days and a radius of $1.586_{-0.040}^{+0.039}$ $R_J$.
We set an upper limit on the planetary mass of $M_P<3.91$ $M_J$ at $3\sigma$
confidence. We confirmed the planetary nature of the transiting companion using
this mass limit and Doppler tomographic observations to verify that the
companion transits HD 332124. These data also demonstrate that the planetary
orbit is well-aligned with the stellar spin, with a sky-projected spin-orbit
misalignment of $\lambda=-5.6_{-1.9}^{+1.7 \circ}$. The star has
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}=7598_{-84}^{+81}$ K, $M_*=1.458_{-0.028}^{+0.029}$
$M_{\odot}$, $R_*=1.638\pm0.034$ $R_{\odot}$, and $v\sin I_*=146$ km s$^{-1}$,
the highest projected rotation velocity of any star known to host a transiting
hot Jupiter. The star also appears to be somewhat metal-poor and
$\alpha$-enhanced, with [Fe/H]$=-0.405_{-0.033}^{+0.032}$ and
[$\alpha$/Fe]$=0.145 \pm 0.053$; these abundances are unusual, but not
extraordinary, for a young star with thin-disk kinematics like KELT-21.
High-resolution imaging observations revealed the presence of a pair of stellar
companions to KELT-21, located at a separation of 1.2" and with a combined
contrast of $\Delta K_S=6.39 \pm 0.06$ with respect to the primary. Although
these companions are most likely physically associated with KELT-21, we cannot
confirm this with our current data. If associated, the candidate companions
KELT-21 B and C would each have masses of $\sim0.12$ $M_{\odot}$, a projected
mutual separation of $\sim20$ AU, and a projected separation of $\sim500$ AU
from KELT-21. KELT-21b may be one of only a handful of known transiting planets
in hierarchical triple stellar systems.


Near-resonance in a system of sub-Neptunes from TESS

  We report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ($TESS$) detection of a
multi-planet system orbiting the $V=10.9$ K0 dwarf TOI 125. We find evidence
for up to five planets, with varying confidence. Three high signal-to-noise
transit signals correspond to sub-Neptune-sized planets ($2.76$, $2.79$, and
$2.94\ R_{\oplus}$), and we statistically validate the planetary nature of the
two inner planets ($P_b = 4.65$ days, $P_c = 9.15$ days). With only two
transits observed, we report the outer object ($P_{.03} = 19.98$ days) as a
high signal-to-noise ratio planet candidate. We also detect a candidate
transiting super-Earth ($1.4\ R_{\oplus}$) with an orbital period of only
$12.7$ hours and a candidate Neptune-sized planet ($4.2\ R_{\oplus}$) with a
period of $13.28$ days, both at low signal-to-noise. This system is amenable to
mass determination via radial velocities and transit timing variations, and
provides an opportunity to study planets of similar size while controlling for
age and environment. The ratio of orbital periods between TOI 125 b and c
($P_c/P_b = 1.97$) is slightly smaller than an exact 2:1 commensurability and
is atypical of multiple planet systems from $Kepler$, which show a preference
for period ratios just $wide$ of first-order period ratios. A dynamical
analysis refines the allowed parameter space through stability arguments and
suggests that, despite the nearly commensurate periods, the system is unlikely
to be in resonance.


No supernovae associated with two long-duration gamma ray bursts

  It is now accepted that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced
during the collapse of a massive star. The standard "collapsar" model predicts
that a broad-lined and luminous Type Ic core-collapse supernova (SN)
accompanies every long-duration GRB. This association has been confirmed in
observations of several nearby GRBs. Here we present observations of two nearby
long-duration GRBs that challenge this simple view. In the GRBs 060505 and
060614 we demonstrate that no SN emission accompanied these long-duration
bursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal SN 1998bw
that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any Type Ic SN ever observed.
Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the
host galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show
that the bursts originated in star-forming regions. The absence of a SN to such
deep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long GRBs and
suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. From the
supplementary material: Now we have observed SN-less GRBs in star-forming
regions, suggesting that a non-detection of a SN does not preclude a massive
progenitor. The position of the GRB, i.e. in a star-forming region or in an
older component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compact
objects and massive stars as progenitors. In fact, several host galaxies for
short GRBs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxies
of long-duration GRBs. The GRB labels "long" and "short" have become synonymous
with "massive stars" and "other progenitors". These distinctions may need to be
relaxed.


A giant planet undergoing extreme ultraviolet irradiation by its hot
  massive-star host

  The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet
depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that
transit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to
transit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature
of ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is
itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat
differential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,
traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the
temperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the
molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of
ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be
significantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital
period ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star
is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the
KELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellar
type K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the
primary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely
atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme
ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,
leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet
largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host
star.


Survey of Period Variations of Superhumps in SU UMa-Type Dwarf Novae

  We systematically surveyed period variations of superhumps in SU UMa-type
dwarf novae based on newly obtained data and past publications. In many
systems, the evolution of superhump period are found to be composed of three
distinct stages: early evolutionary stage with a longer superhump period,
middle stage with systematically varying periods, final stage with a shorter,
stable superhump period. During the middle stage, many systems with superhump
periods less than 0.08 d show positive period derivatives. Contrary to the
earlier claim, we found no clear evidence for variation of period derivatives
between superoutburst of the same object. We present an interpretation that the
lengthening of the superhump period is a result of outward propagation of the
eccentricity wave and is limited by the radius near the tidal truncation. We
interpret that late stage superhumps are rejuvenized excitation of 3:1
resonance when the superhumps in the outer disk is effectively quenched. Many
of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae showed long-enduring superhumps during the
post-superoutburst stage having periods longer than those during the main
superoutburst. The period derivatives in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are found to
be strongly correlated with the fractional superhump excess, or consequently,
mass ratio. WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with a long-lasting rebrightening or with
multiple rebrightenings tend to have smaller period derivatives and are
excellent candidate for the systems around or after the period minimum of
evolution of cataclysmic variables (abridged).


KELT-2Ab: A Hot Jupiter Transiting the Bright (V=8.77) Primary Star of a
  Binary System

  We report the discovery of KELT-2Ab, a hot Jupiter transiting the bright
(V=8.77) primary star of the HD 42176 binary system. The host is a slightly
evolved late F-star likely in the very short-lived "blue-hook" stage of
evolution, with $\teff=6148\pm48{\rm K}$, $\log{g}=4.030_{-0.026}^{+0.015}$ and
$\feh=0.034\pm0.78$. The inferred stellar mass is
$M_*=1.314_{-0.060}^{+0.063}$\msun\ and the star has a relatively large radius
of $R_*=1.836_{-0.046}^{+0.066}$\rsun. The planet is a typical hot Jupiter with
period $4.11379\pm0.00001$ days and a mass of $M_P=1.524\pm0.088$\mj\ and
radius of $R_P=1.290_{-0.050}^{+0.064}$\rj. This is mildly inflated as compared
to models of irradiated giant planets at the $\sim$4 Gyr age of the system.
KELT-2A is the third brightest star with a transiting planet identified by
ground-based transit surveys, and the ninth brightest star overall with a
transiting planet. KELT-2Ab's mass and radius are unique among the subset of
planets with $V<9$ host stars, and therefore increases the diversity of bright
benchmark systems. We also measure the relative motion of KELT-2A and -2B over
a baseline of 38 years, robustly demonstrating for the first time that the
stars are bound. This allows us to infer that KELT-2B is an early K-dwarf. We
hypothesize that through the eccentric Kozai mechanism KELT-2B may have
emplaced KELT-2Ab in its current orbit. This scenario is potentially testable
with Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, which should have an amplitude of
$\sim$44 m s$^{-1}$.


The L 98-59 System: Three Transiting, Terrestrial-Sized Planets Orbiting
  a Nearby M-dwarf

  We report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) discovery of three
terrestrial-sized planets transiting L 98-59 (TOI-175, TIC 307210830) -- a
bright M dwarf at a distance of 10.6 pc. Using the Gaia-measured distance and
broad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined with
the TESS transits from one sector, the corresponding stellar parameters yield
planet radii ranging from 0.7 REarth to 1.3 REarth. All three planets have
short orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just
wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS Data
Validation and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive sources.
These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of the
system, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planets
transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. The
L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright
(V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further
follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements
and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the near
resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary system
dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same
system present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other
variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant. L 98-59 will be
observed in 6 more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information on
the three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additional
planets in the system.


Star Cluster Catalogs for the LEGUS Dwarf Galaxies

  We present the star cluster catalogs for 17 dwarf and irregular galaxies in
the $HST$ Treasury Program "Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey" (LEGUS). Cluster
identification and photometry in this subsample are similar to that of the
entire LEGUS sample, but special methods were developed to provide robust
catalogs with accurate fluxes due to low cluster statistics. The colors and
ages are largely consistent for two widely used aperture corrections, but a
significant fraction of the clusters are more compact than the average training
cluster. However, the ensemble luminosity, mass, and age distributions are
consistent suggesting that the systematics between the two methods are less
than the random errors. When compared with the clusters from previous dwarf
galaxy samples, we find that the LEGUS catalogs are more complete and provide
more accurate total fluxes. Combining all clusters into a composite dwarf
galaxy, we find that the luminosity and mass functions can be described by a
power law with the canonical index of $-2$ independent of age and global SFR
binning. The age distribution declines as a power law, with an index of
$\approx-0.80\pm0.15$, independent of cluster mass and global SFR binning. This
decline of clusters is dominated by cluster disruption since the combined star
formation histories and integrated-light SFRs are both approximately constant
over the last few hundred Myr. Finally, we find little evidence for an
upper-mass cutoff ($<2\sigma$) in the composite cluster mass function, and can
rule out a truncation mass below $\approx10^{4.5}$M$_{\odot}$ but cannot rule
out the existence of a truncation at higher masses.


The Afterglows of Swift-era Gamma-Ray Bursts. I. Comparing pre-Swift and
  Swift era Long/Soft (Type II) GRB Optical Afterglows

  We have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a large
sample of Swift-era gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows including GRBs up to
September 2009, for a total of 76 GRBs, and present an additional three
pre-Swift GRBs not included in an earlier sample. Furthermore, we publish 840
additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 GRB afterglows,
including large data sets for GRBs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820A, 050922C,
060418, 080413A and 080810. We analyzed the light curves of all GRBs in the
sample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the best
data quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. We
transformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 system
and compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-Swift afterglows. The
results of a former study, which showed that GRB afterglows clustered and
exhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the larger
sample. We found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples
(Swift-era and pre-Swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which we
were not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the main
sample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight host
extinction. We derived bolometric isotropic energies for all GRBs in our
sample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energy
release and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the GRB in the
z=1 system. A comparative study of the optical luminosities of GRB afterglows
with echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)
and those without reveals no indication that the former are statistically
significantly more luminous. (abridged)


Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV: Mapping the Milky Way, Nearby Galaxies, and
  the Distant Universe

  We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing
three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky
Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in the
near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)
survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby
galaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas
distributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using
baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the
power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the
SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray
AGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meter
Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations there
began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared
spectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,
with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are
scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy,
SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data
Release 13, was made available in July 2016.


Production and Integration of the ATLAS Insertable B-Layer

  During the shutdown of the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2013-2014, an
additional pixel layer was installed between the existing Pixel detector of the
ATLAS experiment and a new, smaller radius beam pipe. The motivation for this
new pixel layer, the Insertable B-Layer (IBL), was to maintain or improve the
robustness and performance of the ATLAS tracking system, given the higher
instantaneous and integrated luminosities realised following the shutdown.
Because of the extreme radiation and collision rate environment, several new
radiation-tolerant sensor and electronic technologies were utilised for this
layer. This paper reports on the IBL construction and integration prior to its
operation in the ATLAS detector.
