Comparison of the COBE FIRAS and DIRBE Calibrations

  We compare the independent FIRAS and DIRBE observations from the COBE in thewavelength range 100-300 microns. This cross calibration provides checks ofboth data sets. The results show that the data sets are consistent within theestimated gain and offset uncertainties of the two instruments. They show thepossibility of improving the gain and offset determination of DIRBE at 140 and240 microns.

Computing Tropical Varieties

  The tropical variety of a $d$-dimensional prime ideal in a polynomial ringwith complex coefficients is a pure $d$-dimensional polyhedral fan. This fan isshown to be connected in codimension one. We present algorithmic tools forcomputing the tropical variety, and we discuss our implementation of thesetools in the Gr\"obner fan software \texttt{Gfan}. Every ideal is shown to havea finite tropical basis, and a sharp lower bound is given for the size of atropical basis for an ideal of linear forms.

Vortices Clustering: The Origin of the Second Peak in the Magnetisation  Loops of High Temperature Superconductors

  We study vortex clustering in type II Superconductors. We demonstrate thatthe ``second peak'' observed in magnetisation loops may be a dynamical effectassociated with a density driven instability of the vortex system. At themicroscopic level the instability shows up as the clustering of individualvortices at (rare) preferential regions of the pinning potential. In the limitof quasi-static ramping the instability is related to a phase transition in theequilibrium vortex system.

On vector-valued characters for noncommutative function algebras

  Let A be a closed subalgebra of a C*-algebra, that is a closed algebra ofHilbert space operators. We generalize to such operator algebras $A$ severalkey theorems and concepts from the theory of classical function algebras. Inparticular we consider several problems that arise when generalizing classicalfunction algebra results involving characters ((contractive) homomorphisms intothe scalars) on the algebra. For example, the Jensen inequality, the relatedBishop-Ito-Schreiber theorem, and the theory of Gleason parts. We will usuallyreplace characters (classical function algebra case) by D-characters, certaincompletely contractive homomorphisms $\Phi : A \to D$, where D is aC*-subalgebra of A. We also consider some D-valued variants of the classicalGleason-Whitney theorem.

Exploring the anomaly in the interaction cross section and matter radius  of 23O

  New measurements of the interaction cross sections of 22,23O at 900A MeVperformed at the GSI, Darmstadt are reported that address the unsolved puzzleof the large cross section previously observed for 23O. The matter radii forthese oxygen isotopes extracted through a Glauber model analysis are in goodagreement with the new predictions of the ab initio coupled-cluster theoryreported here. They are consistent with a 22O+neutron description of 23O aswell.

NJL and QCD from String Theory

  We study a configuration of D-branes in string theory that is described atlow energies by a four-dimensional field theory with a dynamically brokenchiral symmetry. In a certain region of the parameter space of the braneconfiguration the low-energy theory is a non-local generalization of theNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. This vector model is exactly solvable at largeN_c and dynamically breaks chiral symmetry at arbitrarily weak 't Hooftcoupling. At strong coupling the dynamics is determined by the low-energytheory on D-branes living in the near-horizon geometry of other branes. In adifferent region of parameter space the brane construction gives rise to largeN_c QCD. Thus the D-brane system interpolates between NJL and QCD.

Influence of a carbon over-coat on the X-ray reflectance of XEUS mirrors

  We describe measurements of the X-ray reflectance in the range 2 to 10 keV ofsamples representative of coated silicon wafers that are proposed for thefabrication of the XEUS (X-ray Evolving Universe Spectrometer) mission. Wecompare the reflectance of silicon samples coated with bare Pt, with that forsamples with an additional 10nm thick carbon over-coating. We demonstrate asignificant improvement in reflectance in the energy range ~1 to 4 keV, and ata grazing incidence angle of 10 mrad (0.57 degrees). We consider the resultingeffective area that could be attained with an optimized design of the XEUStelescope. Typically an improvement of 10 to 60 % in effective area, dependingon photon energy, can be achieved using the carbon overcoat.

Stellar intensity interferometry: Experimental steps toward  long-baseline observations

  Experiments are in progress to prepare for intensity interferometry witharrays of air Cherenkov telescopes. At the Bonneville Seabase site, near SaltLake City, a testbed observatory has been set up with two 3-m air Cherenkovtelescopes on a 23-m baseline. Cameras are being constructed, with controlelectronics for either off- or online analysis of the data. At the LundObservatory (Sweden), in Technion (Israel) and at the University of Utah (USA),laboratory intensity interferometers simulating stellar observations have beenset up and experiments are in progress, using various analog and digitalcorrelators, reaching 1.4 ns time resolution, to analyze signals from pairs oflaboratory telescopes.

Spectral Evolution in High Redshift Quasars from the Final BOSS Sample

  We report on the diversity in quasar spectra from the Baryon OscillationSpectroscopic Survey. After filtering the spectra to mitigate selection effectsand Malmquist bias associated with a nearly flux-limited sample, we create highsignal-to-noise ratio composite spectra from 58,656 quasars (2.1 \le z \le3.5), binned by luminosity, spectral index, and redshift. With these compositespectra, we confirm the traditional Baldwin effect (BE, i.e., theanticorrelation of C IV equivalent width (EW) and luminosity) that follows therelation W_\lambda \propto L^{\beta_w} with slope \beta_w = -0.35 \pm 0.004,-0.35 \pm 0.005, and -0.41 \pm 0.005 for z = 2.25, 2.46, and 2.84,respectively. In addition to the redshift evolution in the slope of the BE, wefind redshift evolution in average quasar spectral features at fixedluminosity. The spectroscopic signature of the redshift evolution is correlatedat 98% with the signature of varying luminosity, indicating that they arisefrom the same physical mechanism. At a fixed luminosity, the average C IV FWHMdecreases with increasing redshift and is anti-correlated with C IV EW. Thespectroscopic signature associated with C IV FWHM suggests that the trends inluminosity and redshift are likely caused by a superposition of effects thatare related to black hole mass and Eddington ratio. The redshift evolution isthe consequence of a changing balance between these two quantities as quasarsevolve toward a population with lower typical accretion rates at a given blackhole mass.

Stellar Intensity Interferometry: Imaging capabilities of air Cherenkov  telescope arrays

  Sub milli-arcsecond imaging in the visible band will provide a newperspective in stellar astrophysics. Even though stellar intensityinterferometry was abandoned more than 40 years ago, it is capable of imagingand thus accomplishing more than the measurement of stellar diameters as waspreviously thought. Various phase retrieval techniques can be used toreconstruct actual images provided a sufficient coverage of the interferometricplane is available. Planned large arrays of Air Cherenkov telescopes willprovide thousands of simultaneously available baselines ranging from a few tensof meters to over a kilometer, thus making imaging possible with unprecedentedangular resolution. Here we investigate the imaging capabilities of arrays suchas CTA or AGIS used as Stellar Intensity Interferometry receivers. The studymakes use of simulated data as could realistically be obtained from thesearrays. A Cauchy-Riemann based phase recovery allows the reconstruction ofimages which can be compared to the pristine image for which the data weresimulated. This is first done for uniform disk stars with different radii andcorresponding to various exposure times, and we find that the uncertainty inreconstructing radii is a few percent after a few hours of exposure time.Finally, more complex images are considered, showing that imaging at thesub-milli-arc-second scale is possible.

KELT-11b: A Highly Inflated Sub-Saturn Exoplanet Transiting the V=8  Subgiant HD 93396

  We report the discovery of a transiting exoplanet, KELT-11b, orbiting thebright ($V=8.0$) subgiant HD 93396. A global analysis of the system shows thatthe host star is an evolved subgiant star with $T_{\rm eff} = 5370\pm51$ K,$M_{*} = 1.438_{-0.052}^{+0.061} M_{\odot}$, $R_{*} = 2.72_{-0.17}^{+0.21}R_{\odot}$, log $g_*= 3.727_{-0.046}^{+0.040}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.180\pm0.075$.The planet is a low-mass gas giant in a $P = 4.736529\pm0.00006$ day orbit,with $M_{P} = 0.195\pm0.018 M_J$, $R_{P}= 1.37_{-0.12}^{+0.15} R_J$, $\rho_{P}= 0.093_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$, surface gravity log ${g_{P}} =2.407_{-0.086}^{+0.080}$, and equilibrium temperature $T_{eq} =1712_{-46}^{+51}$ K. KELT-11 is the brightest known transiting exoplanet hostin the southern hemisphere by more than a magnitude, and is the 6th brightesttransit host to date. The planet is one of the most inflated planets known,with an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height (2763 km), and anassociated size of the expected atmospheric transmission signal of 5.6%. Theseattributes make the KELT-11 system a valuable target for follow-up andatmospheric characterization, and it promises to become one of the benchmarksystems for the study of inflated exoplanets.

TESS Discovery of an ultra-short-period planet around the nearby M dwarf  LHS 3844

  Data from the newly-commissioned \textit{Transiting Exoplanet SurveySatellite} (TESS) has revealed a "hot Earth" around LHS 3844, an M dwarflocated 15 pc away. The planet has a radius of $1.32\pm 0.02$ $R_\oplus$ andorbits the star every 11 hours. Although the existence of an atmosphere aroundsuch a strongly irradiated planet is questionable, the star is bright enough($I=11.9$, $K=9.1$) for this possibility to be investigated with transit andoccultation spectroscopy. The star's brightness and the planet's short periodwill also facilitate the measurement of the planet's mass through Dopplerspectroscopy.

KELT-20b: A giant planet with a period of P~ 3.5 days transiting the V~  7.6 early A star HD 185603

  We report the discovery of KELT-20b, a hot Jupiter transiting a V~7.6 early Astar with an orbital period of P~3.47 days. We identified the initial transitsignal in KELT-North survey data. Archival and follow-up photometry, the Gaiaparallax, radial velocities, Doppler tomography, and adaptive optics imagingwere used to confirm the planetary nature of the companion and characterize thesystem. From global modeling we infer that the host star HD 185603 is arapidly-rotating (VsinI~120 km/s) A2V star with an effective temperature of$T_{eff}$=8730K, mass of $M_{star}=1.76M_{sun}$, radius of$R_{star}=1.561R_{sun}$, surface gravity of logg=4.292, and age of <600 Myr.The planetary companion has a radius of $1.735^{+0.070}_{-0.075}~R_{J}$, asemimajor axis of $a=0.0542^{+0.0014}_{-0.0021}$AU, and a linear ephemeris of$BJD_{TDB}=2457503.120049 \pm 0.000190 + E(3.4741070\pm0.0000019)$. We place a$3\sigma$ upper limit of ~3.5 $M_{J}$ on the mass of the planet. The Dopplertomographic measurement indicates that the planetary orbit is well aligned withthe projected spin-axis of the star ($\lambda= 3.4\pm {2.1}$ degrees). Theinclination of the star is constrained to be $24.4<I_*<155.6$ degrees, implyinga true (three-dimensional) spin-orbit alignment of $1.3<\psi<69.8$ degrees. Theplanet receives an insolation flux of $\sim 8\times 10^9~{\rmerg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, implying an equilibrium temperature of of ~ 2250 K,assuming zero albedo and complete heat redistribution. Due to the high stellar$T_{eff}$, the planet also receives an ultraviolet (wavelengths $d\le 91.2$~nm)insolation flux of $\sim 9.1\times 10^4~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, which maylead to significant ablation of the planetary atmosphere. Together withWASP-33, Kepler-13 A, HAT-P-57, KELT-17, and KELT-9, KELT-20 is the sixth Astar host of a transiting giant planet, and the third-brightest host (in V) ofa transiting planet.

Search for the Rare Decays KL->pi0pi0mu+mu- and  KL->pi0pi0X0->pi0pi0mu+mu-

  The KTeV E799 experiment has conducted a search for the rare decaysKL->pi0pi0mu+mu- and KL->pi0pi0X0->pi0pi0mu+mu-, where the X0 is a possible newneutral boson that was reported by the HyperCP experiment with a mass of (214.3pm 0.5) MeV/c^{2}. We find no evidence for either decay. We obtain upper limitsof Br(KL->pi0pi0X0->pi0pi0mu+mu-) < 1.0 x 10^{-10} and Br(KL->pi0pi0mu+mu-) <9.2 x 10^{-11} at the 90% confidence level. This result rules out thepseudoscalar X0 as an explanation of the HyperCP result under the scenario thatthe \bar{d}sX0 coupling is completely real.

KELT-1b: A Strongly Irradiated, Highly Inflated, Short Period, 27  Jupiter-mass Companion Transiting a mid-F Star

  We present the discovery of KELT-1b, the first transiting low-mass companionfrom the wide-field Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope-North (KELT-North)survey. The V=10.7 primary is a mildly evolved, solar-metallicity, mid-F star.The companion is a low-mass brown dwarf or super-massive planet with mass of27.23+/-0.50 MJ and radius of 1.110+0.037-0.024 RJ, on a very short period(P=1.21750007) circular orbit. KELT-1b receives a large amount of stellarinsolation, with an equilibrium temperature assuming zero albedo and perfectredistribution of 2422 K. Upper limits on the secondary eclipse depth indicatethat either the companion must have a non-zero albedo, or it must experiencesome energy redistribution. Comparison with standard evolutionary models forbrown dwarfs suggests that the radius of KELT-1b is significantly inflated.Adaptive optics imaging reveals a candidate stellar companion to KELT-1, whichis consistent with an M dwarf if bound. The projected spin-orbit alignmentangle is consistent with zero stellar obliquity, and the vsini of the primaryis consistent with tidal synchronization. Given the extreme parameters of theKELT-1 system, we expect it to provide an important testbed for theories of theemplacement and evolution of short-period companions, and theories of tidaldissipation and irradiated brown dwarf atmospheres.

The Composite Spectrum of BOSS Quasars Selected for Studies of the  Lyman-alpha Forest

  The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) has collected more than150,000 $2.1 \leq z \leq 3.5$ quasar spectra since 2009. Using thisunprecedented sample, we create a composite spectrum in the rest-frame of102,150 quasar spectra from 800 \AA\ to 3300 \AA\ at a signal-to-noise ratioclose to 1000 per pixel ($\Delta v$ of 69 km~s$^{-1}$). Included in thisanalysis is a correction to account for flux calibration residuals in the BOSSspectrophotometry. We determine the spectral index as a function of redshift ofthe full sample, warp the composite spectrum to match the median spectralindex, and compare the resulting spectrum to SDSS photometry used in targetselection. The quasar composite matches the color of the quasar population towithin 0.02 magnitudes in $g-r$, 0.03 magnitudes in $r-i$, and 0.01 magnitudesin $i-z$ over the redshift range $2.2<z<2.6$. The composite spectrum deviatesfrom the imaging photometry by 0.05 magnitudes around $z = 2.7$, likely due todifferences in target selection as the quasar colors become similar to thestellar locus at this redshift. Finally, we characterize the line features inthe high signal-to-noise composite and identify nine faint lines not found inthe previous composite spectrum from SDSS.

HD 213885b: A transiting 1-day-period super-Earth with an Earth-like  composition around a bright ($V=7.9$) star unveiled by TESS

  We report the discovery of the 1.008-day, ultra-short period (USP)super-Earth HD 213885b (TOI-141b) orbiting the bright ($V=7.9$) star HD 213885(TOI-141, TIC 403224672), detected using photometry from the recently launched\textit{TESS} mission. Using FEROS, HARPS and CORALIE radial-velocities, wemeasure a precise mass of $8.83^{+0.66}_{-0.65}$ $M_\oplus$ for this$1.745^{+0.051}_{-0.052}$ $R_\oplus$ exoplanet, which provides enoughinformation to constrain its bulk composition, which is similar to Earth'scomposition but enriched in iron. The radius, mass and stellar irradiation ofHD 213885b are almost indistinguishable from that of 55 Cancri e, making thisexoplanet its first "twin" in terms of its physical properties --- HD 213885b,however, appears to be denser ($9.15^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ gr cm$^{-3}$) than 55Cancri e. Our precise radial-velocities reveal an additional $4.78$-day signalwhich we interpret as arising from a second, non-transiting planet in thesystem, HD 213885c (TOI-141c), which has a minimum mass of$19.95^{+1.38}_{-1.36}$ $M_\oplus$ and thus is consistent with being aNeptune-mass exoplanet. The HD 213885 system is very interesting from theperspective of future atmospheric characterization, being the second brighteststar to host an ultra-short period transiting super-Earth (with the brighteststar being, in fact, 55 Cancri). Prospects for characterization with presentand future observatories are discussed.

KELT-16b: A highly irradiated, ultra-short period hot Jupiter nearing  tidal disruption

  We announce the discovery of KELT-16b, a highly irradiated, ultra-shortperiod hot Jupiter transiting the relatively bright ($V = 11.7$) star TYC2688-1839-1. A global analysis of the system shows KELT-16 to be an F7V starwith $T_\textrm{eff} = 6236\pm54$ K, $\log{g_\star} = 4.253_{-0.036}^{+0.031}$,[Fe/H] = -0.002$_{-0.085}^{+0.086}$, $M_\star = 1.211_{-0.046}^{+0.043}M_\odot$, and $R_\star = 1.360_{-0.053}^{+0.064} R_\odot$. The planet is arelatively high mass inflated gas giant with $M_\textrm{P} =2.75_{-0.15}^{+0.16} M_\textrm{J}$, $R_\textrm{P} = 1.415_{-0.067}^{+0.084}R_\textrm{J}$, density $\rho_\textrm{P} = 1.20\pm0.18$ g cm$^{-3}$, surfacegravity $\log{g_\textrm{P}} = 3.530_{-0.049}^{+0.042}$, and $T_\textrm{eq} =2453_{-47}^{+55}$ K. The best-fitting linear ephemeris is $T_\textrm{C} =2457247.24791\pm0.00019$ BJD$_{tdb}$ and $P = 0.9689951 \pm 0.0000024$ d.KELT-16b joins WASP-18b, -19b, -43b, -103b, and HATS-18b as the only gianttransiting planets with $P < 1$ day. Its ultra-short period and highirradiation make it a benchmark target for atmospheric studies by HST, Spitzer,and eventually JWST. For example, as a hotter, higher mass analog of WASP-43b,KELT-16b may feature an atmospheric temperature-pressure inversion andday-to-night temperature swing extreme enough for TiO to rain out at theterminator. KELT-16b could also join WASP-43b in extending tests of theobserved mass-metallicity relation of the Solar System gas giants to highermasses. KELT-16b currently orbits at a mere $\sim$ 1.7 Roche radii from itshost star, and could be tidally disrupted in as little as a few $\times 10^{5}$years (for a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q_*' = 10^5$). Finally, thelikely existence of a widely separated bound stellar companion in the KELT-16system makes it possible that Kozai-Lidov oscillations played a role in drivingKELT-16b inward to its current precarious orbit.

Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project VI:  reverberating Disk Models for NGC 5548

  We conduct a multiwavelength continuum variability study of the Seyfert 1galaxy NGC 5548 to investigate the temperature structure of its accretion disk.The 19 overlapping continuum light curves (1158 to 9157 angstroms) combinesimultaneous HST , Swift , and ground-based observations over a 180 day periodfrom 2014 January to July. Light-curve variability is interpreted as thereverberation response of the accretion disk to irradiation by a centraltime-varying point source. Our model yields the disk inclination, i,temperature T1 at 1 light day from the black hole, and a temperature-radiusslope, alpha. We also infer the driving light curve and find that it correlatespoorly with both the hard and soft X-ray light curves, suggesting that theX-rays alone may not drive the ultraviolet and optical variability over theobserving period. We also decompose the light curves into bright, faint, andmean accretion-disk spectra. These spectra lie below that expected for astandard blackbody accretion disk accreting at L/LEdd = 0.1

KELT-18b: Puffy Planet, Hot Host, Probably Perturbed

  We report the discovery of KELT-18b, a transiting hot Jupiter in a 2.87dorbit around the bright (V=10.1), hot, F4V star BD+60 1538 (TYC 3865-1173-1).We present follow-up photometry, spectroscopy, and adaptive optics imaging thatallow a detailed characterization of the system. Our preferred model fits yielda host stellar temperature of 6670+/-120 K and a mass of 1.524+/-0.069 Msun,situating it as one of only a handful of known transiting planets with hoststhat are as hot, massive, and bright. The planet has a mass of 1.18+/-0.11Mjup, a radius of 1.57+/-0.04 Rjup, and a density of 0.377+/-0.040 g/cm^3,making it one of the most inflated planets known around a hot star. We arguethat KELT-18b's high temperature and low surface gravity, which yield anestimated ~600 km atmospheric scale height, combined with its hot, bright hostmake it an excellent candidate for observations aimed at atmosphericcharacterization. We also present evidence for a bound stellar companion at aprojected separation of ~1100 AU, and speculate that it may have contributed tothe strong misalignment we suspect between KELT-18's spin axis and its planet'sorbital axis. The inferior conjunction time is 2457542.524998 +/-0.000416(BJD_TDB) and the orbital period is 2.8717510 +/- 0.0000029 days. We encourageRossiter-McLaughlin measurements in the near future to confirm the suspectedspin-orbit misalignment of this system.

A Single Circumbinary Disk in the HD 98800 Quadruple System

  We present sub-arcsecond thermal infrared imaging of HD 98800, a youngquadruple system composed of a pair of low-mass spectroscopic binariesseparated by 0.8'' (38 AU), each with a K-dwarf primary. Images at wavelengthsranging from 5 to 24.5 microns show unequivocally that the optically fainterbinary, HD 98800B, is the sole source of a comparatively large infrared excessupon which a silicate emission feature is superposed. The excess is detectedonly at wavelengths of 7.9 microns and longer, peaks at 25 microns, and has abest-fit black-body temperature of 150 K, indicating that most of the dust liesat distances greater than the orbital separation of the spectroscopic binary.We estimate the radial extent of the dust with a disk model that approximatesradiation from the spectroscopic binary as a single source of equivalentluminosity. Given the data, the most-likely values of disk properties in theranges considered are R_in = 5.0 +/- 2.5 AU, DeltaR = 13+/-8 AU, lambda_0 =2(+4/-1.5) microns, gamma = 0+/-2.5, and sigma_total = 16+/-3 AU^2, where R_inis the inner radius, DeltaR is the radial extent of the disk, lambda_0 is theeffective grain size, gamma is the radial power-law exponent of the opticaldepth, tau, and sigma_total is the total cross-section of the grains. The rangeof implied disk masses is 0.001--0.1 times that of the moon. These results showthat, for a wide range of possible disk properties, a circumbinary disk is farmore likely than a narrow ring.

KELT-7b: A hot Jupiter transiting a bright V=8.54 rapidly rotating  F-star

  We report the discovery of KELT-7b, a transiting hot Jupiter with a mass of$1.28 \pm 0.18$ MJ, radius of $1.53_{-0.047}^{+0.046}$ RJ, and an orbitalperiod of $2.7347749 \pm 0.0000039$ days. The bright host star (HD33643;KELT-7) is an F-star with $V=8.54$, Teff $=6789_{-49}^{+50}$ K, [Fe/H]$=0.139_{-0.081}^{+0.075}$, and $\log{g}=4.149 \pm 0.019$. It has a mass of$1.535_{-0.054}^{+0.066}$ Msun, a radius of $1.732_{-0.045}^{+0.043}$ Rsun, andis the fifth most massive, fifth hottest, and the ninth brightest star known tohost a transiting planet. It is also the brightest star around which KELT hasdiscovered a transiting planet. Thus, KELT-7b is an ideal target for detailedcharacterization given its relatively low surface gravity, high equilibriumtemperature, and bright host star. The rapid rotation of the star ($73 \pm 0.5$km/s) results in a Rossiter-McLaughlin effect with an unusually large amplitudeof several hundred m/s. We find that the orbit normal of the planet is likelyto be well-aligned with the stellar spin axis, with a projected spin-orbitalignment of $\lambda=9.7 \pm 5.2$ degrees. This is currently the second mostrapidly rotating star to have a reflex signal (and thus mass determination) dueto a planetary companion measured.

Kepler-1647b: the largest and longest-period Kepler transiting  circumbinary planet

  We report the discovery of a new Kepler transiting circumbinary planet (CBP).This latest addition to the still-small family of CBPs defies the current trendof known short-period planets orbiting near the stability limit of binarystars. Unlike the previous discoveries, the planet revolving around theeclipsing binary system Kepler-1647 has a very long orbital period (~1100 days)and was at conjunction only twice during the Kepler mission lifetime. Due tothe singular configuration of the system, Kepler-1647b is not only thelongest-period transiting CBP at the time of writing, but also one of thelongest-period transiting planets. With a radius of 1.06+/-0.01 RJup it is alsothe largest CBP to date. The planet produced three transits in the light-curveof Kepler-1647 (one of them during an eclipse, creating a syzygy) andmeasurably perturbed the times of the stellar eclipses, allowing us to measureits mass to be 1.52+/-0.65 MJup. The planet revolves around an 11-day periodeclipsing binary consisting of two Solar-mass stars on a slightly inclined,mildly eccentric (e_bin = 0.16), spin-synchronized orbit. Despite having anorbital period three times longer than Earth's, Kepler-1647b is in theconservative habitable zone of the binary star throughout its orbit.

A Bright Short Period M-M Eclipsing Binary from the KELT Survey:  Magnetic Activity and the Mass-Radius Relationship for M-dwarfs

  We report the discovery of KELT J041621-620046, a moderately bright(J$\sim$10.2) M dwarf eclipsing binary system at a distance of 39$\pm$3 pc.KELT J041621-620046 was first identified as an eclipsing binary usingobservations from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey. Thesystem has a short orbital period of $\sim$1.11 days and consists of componentswith M$_1$ = $0.447^{-0.047}_{+0.052}\,M_\odot$ and M$_2$ =$0.399^{-0.042}_{+0.046}\,M_\odot$ in nearly circular orbits. The radii of thetwo stars are R$_1$ = $0.540^{-0.032}_{+0.034}\,R_\odot$ and R$_2$ =$0.453\pm0.017\,R_\odot$. Full system and orbital properties were determined(to $\sim$10% error) by conducting an EBOP global modeling of the highprecision photometric and spectroscopic observations obtained by the KELTFollow-up Network. Each star is larger by 17-28% and cooler by 4-10% thanpredicted by standard (non-magnetic) stellar models. Strong H$\alpha$ emissionindicates chromospheric activity in both stars. The observed radii andtemperature discrepancies for both components are more consistent with thosepredicted by empirical relations that account for convective suppression due tomagnetic activity.

Emission Line Properties of Seyfert Galaxies in the 12 Micron Sample

  We present spectroscopy of emission lines for 81 Seyfert 1 and 104 Seyfert 2galaxies in the IRAS 12$\mu$m galaxy sample. We analyzed the emission-lineluminosity functions, reddening, and other gas diagnostics. The narrow-lineregions (NLR) of Sy1 and 2 galaxies do not significantly differ from each otherin most of these diagnostics. Combining the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio with a newreddening indicator-the [SII]6720/[OII]3727 ratio, we find the average$E(B-V)=0.49\pm0.35$ for Sy1s and $0.52\pm0.26$ for Sy2s. The NLR of Sy1galaxies has only marginally higher ionization than the Sy2s. Our sampleincludes 22 Sy1.9s and 1.8s. In their narrow lines, these low-luminositySeyferts are more similar to the Sy2s than the Sy1s. We construct a BPTdiagram, and include the Sy1.8s and 1.9s. They overlap the region occupied bythe Sy2s. The C IV equivalent width correlates more strongly with [OIII]/H$\beta$ than with UV luminosity. The Sy1 and Sy2 luminosity functions of[OII]3727 and [OIII]5007 are indistinguishable. Unlike the LF's of Seyfertgalaxies measured by SDSS, ours are nearly flat at low L. The larger number offaint Sloan "AGN" is attributable to their inclusion of weakly emitting LINERsand H II+AGN "composite" nuclei, which do not meet our classification criteriafor Seyferts. An Appendix investigates which emission line luminosities providethe most reliable measures of the total non-stellar luminosity. The hard X-rayor near-ultraviolet continuum luminosity can be crudely predicted from eitherthe [O III]5007 luminosity, or the combination of [O III]+H$\beta$, or [NII]+H$\alpha$ lines, with a scatter of $\pm\,4$ times for the Sy1s and$\pm\,10$ times for the Sy2s. The latter two hybrid (NLR+BLR) indicators havethe advantage of predicting the same HX luminosity independent of Seyfert type.

The KELT Follow-Up Network and Transit False Positive Catalog:  Pre-vetted False Positives for TESS

  The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project has been conductinga photometric survey for transiting planets orbiting bright stars for over tenyears. The KELT images have a pixel scale of ~23"/pixel---very similar to thatof NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)---as well as a largepoint spread function, and the KELT reduction pipeline uses a weightedphotometric aperture with radius 3'. At this angular scale, multiple stars aretypically blended in the photometric apertures. In order to identify falsepositives and confirm transiting exoplanets, we have assembled a follow-upnetwork (KELT-FUN) to conduct imaging with higher spatial resolution, cadence,and photometric precision than the KELT telescopes, as well as spectroscopicobservations of the candidate host stars. The KELT-FUN team has followed-upover 1,600 planet candidates since 2011, resulting in more than 20 planetdiscoveries. Excluding ~450 false alarms of non-astrophysical origin (i.e.,instrumental noise or systematics), we present an all-sky catalog of the 1,128bright stars (6<V<10) that show transit-like features in the KELT light curves,but which were subsequently determined to be astrophysical false positives(FPs) after photometric and/or spectroscopic follow-up observations. TheKELT-FUN team continues to pursue KELT and other planet candidates and willeventually follow up certain classes of TESS candidates. The KELT FP catalogwill help minimize the duplication of follow-up observations by current andfuture transit surveys such as TESS.

The Need for Laboratory Work to Aid in The Understanding of Exoplanetary  Atmospheres

  Advancements in our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres, from massivegas giants down to rocky worlds, depend on the constructive challenges betweenobservations and models. We are now on a clear trajectory for improvements inexoplanet observations that will revolutionize our ability to characterize theatmospheric structure, composition, and circulation of these worlds. Theseimprovements stem from significant investments in new missions and facilities,such as JWST and the several planned ground-based extremely large telescopes.However, while exoplanet science currently has a wide range of sophisticatedmodels that can be applied to the tide of forthcoming observations, thetrajectory for preparing these models for the upcoming observational challengesis unclear. Thus, our ability to maximize the insights gained from the nextgeneration of observatories is not certain. In many cases, uncertainties in apath towards model advancement stems from insufficiencies in the laboratorydata that serve as critical inputs to atmospheric physical and chemical tools.We outline a number of areas where laboratory or ab initio investigations couldfill critical gaps in our ability to model exoplanet atmospheric opacities,clouds, and chemistry. Specifically highlighted are needs for: (1) molecularopacity linelists with parameters for a diversity of broadening gases, (2)extended databases for collision-induced absorption and dimer opacities, (3)high spectral resolution opacity data for relevant molecular species, (4)laboratory studies of haze and condensate formation and optical properties, (5)significantly expanded databases of chemical reaction rates, and (6)measurements of gas photo-absorption cross sections at high temperatures. Wehope that by meeting these needs, we can make the next two decades of exoplanetscience as productive and insightful as the previous two decades. (abr)

KELT-17b: A hot-Jupiter transiting an A-star in a misaligned orbit  detected with Doppler tomography

  We present the discovery of a hot-Jupiter transiting the V=9.23 magmain-sequence A-star KELT-17 (BD+14 1881). KELT-17b is a 1.31 -0.29/+0.28 Mj,1.525 -0.060/+0.065 Rj hot-Jupiter in a 3.08 day period orbit misaligned at-115.9 +/- 4.1 deg to the rotation axis of the star. The planet is confirmedvia both the detection of the radial velocity orbit, and the Dopplertomographic detection of the shadow of the planet over two transits. The natureof the spin-orbit misaligned transit geometry allows us to place a constrainton the level of differential rotation in the host star; we find that KELT-17 isconsistent with both rigid-body rotation and solar differential rotation rates(alpha < 0.30 at 2 sigma significance). KELT-17 is only the fourth A-star witha confirmed transiting planet, and with a mass of 1.635 -0.061/+0.066 Msun,effective temperature of 7454 +/- 49 K, and projected rotational velocity v sinI_* = 44.2 -1.3/+1.5 km/s; it is amongst the most massive, hottest, and mostrapidly rotating of known planet hosts.

Photometry and spectroscopy of GRB 060526: A detailed study of the  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst

  Aims: With this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglowlight curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060526 at $z=3.221$.Methods: We present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for aGRB afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultravioletto the near infrared. The data set contains 412 data points in total to whichwe add additional data from the literature. Furthermore, we presentlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. The afterglowlight curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power lawfits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.The absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive columndensities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis fromwhich we derive the metallicity of the host of GRB 060526. Results: Thetemporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law withbreaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. It shows deviationsfrom the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energyinjections from the central engine, although some significant microvariabilityremains. The broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows nosignificant extinction along the line of sight. The metallicity derived from\ion{S}{II} and \ion{Fe}{II} of [S/H] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [Fe/H] =--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparableto the metallicity of other GRB hosts at similar redshifts. At the position ofthe afterglow, no host is detected to F775W(AB) = 28.5 mag with the HST,implying an absolute magnitude of the host M(1500 \AA{})$>$--18.3 mag which isfainter than most long-duration hosts, although the GRB may be associated witha faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

Reconstructing Extreme Space Weather from Planet Hosting Stars

  The field of exoplanetary science is making rapid progress both instatistical studies of exoplanet properties as well as in individualcharacterization. As space missions provide an emerging picture of formationand evolution of exoplanetary systems, the search for habitable worlds becomesone of the fundamental issues to address. To tackle such a complex challenge,we need to specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development andsustainment of life as we know it. This requires the understanding of global(astrospheric) and local (atmospheric, surface and internal) environments ofexoplanets in the framework of the physical processes of the interactionbetween evolving planet-hosting stars along with exoplanetary evolution overgeological timescales, and the resulting impact on climate and habitability ofexoplanets. Feedbacks between astrophysical, physico-chemical atmospheric andgeological processes can only be understood through interdisciplinary studieswith the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary,Earth sciences, astrobiology, and the origin of life communities. Theassessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability ofterrestrial (exo)planets and potential exomoons around them may significantlymodify the extent and the location of the habitable zone and provide newdirections for searching for signatures of life. Thus, characterization ofstellar ionizing outputs becomes an important task for further understandingthe extent of habitability in the universe. The goal of this white paper is toidentify and describe promising key research goals to aid the theoreticalcharacterization and observational detection of ionizing radiation fromquiescent and flaring upper atmospheres of planet hosts as well as propertiesof stellar coronal mass ejections and stellar energetic particle events.

KELT-10b: The First Transiting Exoplanet from the KELT-South Survey -- A  Hot Sub-Jupiter Transiting a V = 10.7 Early G-Star

  We report the discovery of KELT-10b, the first transiting exoplanetdiscovered using the KELT-South telescope. KELT-10b is a highly inflatedsub-Jupiter mass planet transiting a relatively bright $V = 10.7$ star (TYC8378-64-1), with T$_{eff}$ = $5948\pm74$ K, $\log{g}$ =$4.319_{-0.030}^{+0.020}$ and [Fe/H] = $0.09_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$, an inferred massM$_{*}$ = $1.112_{-0.061}^{+0.055}$ M$_{\odot}$ and radius R$_{*}$ =$1.209_{-0.035}^{+0.047}$ R$_{\odot}$. The planet has a radius R$_{P}$ =$1.399_{-0.049}^{+0.069}$ R$_{J}$ and mass M$_{P}$ = $0.679_{-0.038}^{+0.039}$M$_{J}$. The planet has an eccentricity consistent with zero and a semi-majoraxis $a$ = $0.05250_{-0.00097}^{+0.00086}$ AU. The best fitting linearephemeris is $T_{0}$ = 2457066.72045$\pm$0.00027 BJD$_{TDB}$ and P =4.1662739$\pm$0.0000063 days. This planet joins a group of highly inflatedtransiting exoplanets with a radius much larger and a mass much less than thoseof Jupiter. The planet, which boasts deep transits of 1.4%, has a relativelyhigh equilibrium temperature of T$_{eq}$ = $1377_{-23}^{+28}$ K, assuming zeroalbedo and perfect heat redistribution. KELT-10b receives an estimatedinsolation of $0.817_{-0.054}^{+0.068}$ $\times$ 10$^9$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,which places it far above the insolation threshold above which hot Jupitersexhibit increasing amounts of radius inflation. Evolutionary analysis of thehost star suggests that KELT-10b is unlikely to survive beyond the currentsubgiant phase, due to a concomitant in-spiral of the planet over the next$\sim$1 Gyr. The planet transits a relatively bright star and exhibits thethird largest transit depth of all transiting exoplanets with V $<$ 11 in thesouthern hemisphere, making it a promising candidate for future atmosphericcharacterization studies.

KELT-14b and KELT-15b: An Independent Discovery of WASP-122b and a New  Hot Jupiter

  We report the discovery of KELT-14b and KELT-15b, two hot Jupiters from theKELT-South survey. KELT-14b, an independent discovery of the recently announcedWASP-122b, is an inflated Jupiter mass planet that orbits a$\sim5.0^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$ Gyr, $V$ = 11.0, G2 star that is near the main sequenceturnoff. The host star, KELT-14 (TYC 7638-981-1), has an inferred mass$M_{*}$=$1.18_{-0.07}^{+0.05}$$M_{\odot}$ and radius$R_{*}$=$1.37\pm{-0.08}$$R_{\odot}$, and has $T_{eff}$=$5802_{-92}^{+95}$K,$\log{g_*}$=$4.23_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ and =$0.33\pm{0.09}$. The planet orbits witha period of $1.7100588 \pm 0.0000025$ days ($T_{0}$=2457091.02863$\pm$0.00047)and has a radius R$_{p}$=$1.52_{-0.11}^{+0.12}$$R_{J}$ and massM$_{p}$=$1.196\pm0.072$$M_{J}$, and the eccentricity is consistent with zero.KELT-15b is another inflated Jupiter mass planet that orbits a $\sim$$4.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ Gyr, $V$ = 11.2, G0 star (TYC 8146-86-1) that is near the"blue hook" stage of evolution prior to the Hertzsprung gap, and has aninferred mass $M_{*}$=$1.181_{-0.050}^{+0.051}$$M_{\odot}$ and radius$R_{*}$=$1.48_{-0.04}^{+0.09}$$R_{\odot}$, and $T_{eff}$=$6003_{-52}^{+56}$K,$\log{g_*}$=$4.17_{-0.04}^{+0.02}$ and [Fe/H]=$0.05\pm0.03$. The planet orbitson a period of $3.329441 \pm 0.000016$ days ($T_{0}$ = 2457029.1663$\pm$0.0073)and has a radius R$_{p}$=$1.443_{-0.057}^{+0.11}$$R_{J}$ and massM$_{p}$=$0.91_{-0.22}^{+0.21}$$M_{J}$ and an eccentricity consistent with zero.KELT-14b has the second largest expected emission signal in the K-band forknown transiting planets brighter than $K<10.5$. Both KELT-14b and KELT-15b arepredicted to have large enough emission signals that their secondary eclipsesshould be detectable using ground-based observatories.

KELT-12b: A $P \sim 5$ Day, Highly Inflated Hot Jupiter Transiting a  Mildly Evolved Hot Star

  We report the discovery of KELT-12b, a highly inflated Jupiter-mass planettransiting a mildly evolved host star. We identified the initial transit signalin the KELT-North survey data and established the planetary nature of thecompanion through precise follow-up photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy,precise radial velocity measurements, and high-resolution adaptive opticsimaging. Our preferred best-fit model indicates that the $V = 10.64$ host, TYC2619-1057-1, has $T_{\rm eff} = 6278 \pm 51$ K, $\log{g_\star} =3.89^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$, and [Fe/H] = $0.19^{+0.083}_{-0.085}$, with aninferred mass $M_{\star} = 1.59^{+0.071}_{-0.091} M_\odot$ and radius $R_\star= 2.37 \pm 0.18 R_\odot$. The planetary companion has $M_{\rm P} = 0.95 \pm0.14 M_{\rm J}$, $R_{\rm P} = 1.79^{+0.18}_{-0.17} R_{\rm J}$, $\log{g_{\rm P}}= 2.87^{+0.097}_{-0.098}$, and density $\rho_{\rm P} = 0.21^{+0.075}_{-0.054}$g cm$^{-3}$, making it one of the most inflated giant planets known. The timeof inferior conjunction in ${\rm BJD_{TDB}}$ is $2457088.692055 \pm 0.0009$ andthe period is $P = 5.0316144 \pm 0.0000306$ days. Despite the relatively largeseparation of $\sim0.07$ AU implied by its $\sim 5.03$-day orbital period,KELT-12b receives significant flux of $2.93^{+0.33}_{-0.30} \times 10^9$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ from its host. We compare the radii and insolations oftransiting gas-giant planets around hot ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 6250$ K) and coolstars, noting that the observed paucity of known transiting giants around hotstars with low insolation is likely due to selection effects. We underscore thesignificance of long-term ground-based monitoring of hot stars and space-basedtargeting of hot stars with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) tosearch for inflated giants in longer-period orbits.

KELT-19Ab: A P~4.6 Day Hot Jupiter Transiting a Likely Am Star with a  Distant Stellar Companion

  We present the discovery of the giant planet KELT-19Ab, which transits themoderately bright $(\mathrm{V} \sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with anorbital period of 4.61 days. We confirm the planetary nature of the companionvia a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<4.1\,\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, whichindicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda =-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\rm{T_{eff}}=7500 \pm 110\,\mathrm{K}$ host star has $\mathrm{M_*} =1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\mathrm{R_*} = 1.83 \pm0.10\,\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $\mathrm{R_P}=1.91 \pm0.11\,\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibriumtemperature of $\rm{T_{EQ}} = \sim 1935\,\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo andcomplete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm2.0\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared toother stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhancedin metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely anAm star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transitingplanet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system revealthe existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at aprojected separation of $\approx 160\,\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocitymeasurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known tohave stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slowrotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely tohave caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced thetransiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.

KELT-22Ab: A Massive Hot Jupiter Transiting a Near Solar Twin

  We present the discovery of KELT-22Ab, a hot Jupiter from the KELT-Southsurvey. KELT-22Ab transits the moderately bright ($V\sim 11.1$) Sun-like G2Vstar TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 1.3866529 \pm0.0000027 $ days, a radius of $R_{P} = 1.285_{-0.071}^{+0.12}~R_{J}$, and arelatively large mass of $M_{P} = 3.47_{-0.14}^{+0.15}~ M_{J}$. The star has$R_{\star} = 1.099_{-0.046}^{+0.079}~ R_{\odot}$, $M_{\star} =1.092_{-0.041}^{+0.045}~ M_{\odot}$, ${T_{\rm eff}\,} = 5767_{-49}^{+50}~$ K,${\log{g_\star}} = 4.393_{-0.060}^{+0.039}~$ (cgs), and [m/H] =$+0.259_{-0.083}^{+0.085}~$, and thus, other than its slightly super-solarmetallicity, appears to be a near solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibitskinematics and a Galactic orbit that are somewhat atypical for thin disk stars.Nevertheless, the star is rotating quite rapidly for its estimated age, showsevidence of chromospheric activity, and is somewhat metal rich. Imaging revealsa slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projectedseparation of 6\arcsec ($\sim$1400 AU). In addition to the orbital motioncaused by the transiting planet, we detect a possible linear trend in theradial velocity of KELT-22A suggesting the presence of another relativelynearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as aconsequence of the small semi-major axis of $a/R_{\star} = 4.97$), and ismildly inflated. At such small separations, tidal forces become significant.The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the rate of tidaldissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces,the semi-major axis of KELT-22Ab is decreasing rapidly, and is thus predictedto spiral into the star within the next Gyr.

KELT-6b: A P~7.9 d Hot Saturn Transiting a Metal-Poor Star with a  Long-Period Companion

  We report the discovery of KELT-6b, a mildly-inflated Saturn-mass planettransiting a metal-poor host. The initial transit signal was identified inKELT-North survey data, and the planetary nature of the occulter wasestablished using a combination of follow-up photometry, high-resolutionimaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and precise radial velocitymeasurements. The fiducial model from a global analysis including constraintsfrom isochrones indicates that the V=10.38 host star (BD+31 2447) is a mildlyevolved, late-F star with T_eff=6102 \pm 43 K, log(g_*)=4.07_{-0.07}^{+0.04}and [Fe/H]=-0.28 \pm 0.04, with an inferred mass M_*=1.09 \pm 0.04 M_sun andradius R_star=1.58_{-0.09}^{+0.16} R_sun. The planetary companion has massM_P=0.43 \pm 0.05 M_J, radius R_P=1.19_{-0.08}^{+0.13} R_J, surface gravitylog(g_P)=2.86_{-0.08}^{+0.06}, and density rho_P=0.31_{-0.08}^{+0.07}g~cm^{-3}. The planet is on an orbit with semimajor axis a=0.079 \pm 0.001 AUand eccentricity e=0.22_{-0.10}^{+0.12}, which is roughly consistent withcircular, and has ephemeris of T_c(BJD_TDB)=2456347.79679 \pm 0.00036 andP=7.845631 \pm 0.000046 d. Equally plausible fits that employ empiricalconstraints on the host star parameters rather than isochrones yield a largerplanet mass and radius by ~4-7%. KELT-6b has surface gravity and incident fluxsimilar to HD209458b, but orbits a host that is more metal poor than HD209458by ~0.3 dex. Thus, the KELT-6 system offers an opportunity to perform acomparative measurement of two similar planets in similar environments aroundstars of very different metallicities. The precise radial velocity data alsoreveal an acceleration indicative of a longer-period third body in the system,although the companion is not detected in Keck adaptive optics images.

KELT-8b: A highly inflated transiting hot Jupiter and a new technique  for extracting high-precision radial velocities from noisy spectra

  We announce the discovery of a highly inflated transiting hot Jupiterdiscovered by the KELT-North survey. A global analysis including constraintsfrom isochrones indicates that the V = 10.8 host star (HD 343246) is a mildlyevolved, G dwarf with $T_{\rm eff} = 5754_{-55}^{+54}$ K, $\log{g} =4.078_{-0.054}^{+0.049}$, $[Fe/H] = 0.272\pm0.038$, an inferred mass$M_{*}=1.211_{-0.066}^{+0.078}$ M$_{\odot}$, and radius$R_{*}=1.67_{-0.12}^{+0.14}$ R$_{\odot}$. The planetary companion has mass $M_P= 0.867_{-0.061}^{+0.065}$ $M_{J}$, radius $R_P = 1.86_{-0.16}^{+0.18}$$R_{J}$, surface gravity $\log{g_{P}} = 2.793_{-0.075}^{+0.072}$, and density$\rho_P = 0.167_{-0.038}^{+0.047}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The planet is on a roughlycircular orbit with semimajor axis $a = 0.04571_{-0.00084}^{+0.00096}$ AU andeccentricity $e = 0.035_{-0.025}^{+0.050}$. The best-fit linear ephemeris is$T_0 = 2456883.4803 \pm 0.0007$ BJD$_{\rm TDB}$ and $P = 3.24406 \pm 0.00016$days. This planet is one of the most inflated of all known transitingexoplanets, making it one of the few members of a class of extremely lowdensity, highly-irradiated gas giants. The low stellar $\log{g}$ and largeimplied radius are supported by stellar density constraints from follow-uplight curves, plus an evolutionary and space motion analysis. We also develop anew technique to extract high precision radial velocities from noisy spectrathat reduces the observing time needed to confirm transiting planet candidates.This planet boasts deep transits of a bright star, a large inferred atmosphericscale height, and a high equilibrium temperature of $T_{eq}=1675^{+61}_{-55}$K, assuming zero albedo and perfect heat redistribution, making it one of thebest targets for future atmospheric characterization studies.

Planet Formation Imager (PFI): science vision and key requirements

  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) project aims to provide a strong scientificvision for ground-based optical astronomy beyond the upcoming generation ofExtremely Large Telescopes. We make the case that a breakthrough in angularresolution imaging capabilities is required in order to unravel the processesinvolved in planet formation. PFI will be optimised to provide a completecensus of the protoplanet population at all stellocentric radii and over theage range from 0.1 to about 100 Myr. Within this age period, planetary systemsundergo dramatic changes and the final architecture of planetary systems isdetermined. Our goal is to study the planetary birth on the natural spatialscale where the material is assembled, which is the "Hill Sphere" of theforming planet, and to characterise the protoplanetary cores by measuring theirmasses and physical properties. Our science working group has investigated theobservational characteristics of these young protoplanets as well as themigration mechanisms that might alter the system architecture. We simulated theimprints that the planets leave in the disk and study how PFI couldrevolutionise areas ranging from exoplanet to extragalactic science. In thiscontribution we outline the key science drivers of PFI and discuss therequirements that will guide the technology choices, the site selection, andpotential science/technology tradeoffs.

KELT-4Ab: An inflated Hot Jupiter transiting the bright (V~10) component  of a hierarchical triple

  We report the discovery of KELT-4Ab, an inflated, transiting Hot Jupiterorbiting the brightest component of a hierarchical triple stellar system. Thehost star is an F star with $T_{\rm eff}=6206\pm75$ K, $\log g=4.108\pm0.014$,$\left[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}\right]=-0.116_{-0.069}^{+0.065}$, ${\rmM_*}=1.201_{-0.061}^{+0.067} \ {\rm M}_{\odot}$, and ${\rmR_*}=1.610_{-0.068}^{+0.078} \ {\rm R}_{\odot}$. The best-fit linear ephemerisis $\rm {BJD_{TDB}} = 2456193.29157 \pm 0.00021 + E\left(2.9895936 \pm0.0000048\right)$. With a magnitude of $V\sim10$, a planetary radius of$1.699_{-0.045}^{+0.046} \ {\rm R_J}$, and a mass of $0.902_{-0.059}^{+0.060} \{\rm M_J}$, it is the brightest host among the population of inflated HotJupiters ($R_P > 1.5R_J$), making it a valuable discovery for probing thenature of inflated planets. In addition, its existence within a hierarchicaltriple and its proximity to Earth ($210$ pc) provides a unique opportunity fordynamical studies with continued monitoring with high resolution imaging andprecision radial velocities. In particular, the motion of the binary starsaround each other and of both stars around the primary star relative to themeasured epoch in this work should be detectable when it rises in October 2015.

KELT-21b: A Hot Jupiter Transiting the Rapidly-Rotating Metal-Poor  Late-A Primary of a Likely Hierarchical Triple System

  We present the discovery of KELT-21b, a hot Jupiter transiting the $V=10.5$A8V star HD 332124. The planet has an orbital period of$P=3.6127647\pm0.0000033$ days and a radius of $1.586_{-0.040}^{+0.039}$ $R_J$.We set an upper limit on the planetary mass of $M_P<3.91$ $M_J$ at $3\sigma$confidence. We confirmed the planetary nature of the transiting companion usingthis mass limit and Doppler tomographic observations to verify that thecompanion transits HD 332124. These data also demonstrate that the planetaryorbit is well-aligned with the stellar spin, with a sky-projected spin-orbitmisalignment of $\lambda=-5.6_{-1.9}^{+1.7 \circ}$. The star has$T_{\mathrm{eff}}=7598_{-84}^{+81}$ K, $M_*=1.458_{-0.028}^{+0.029}$$M_{\odot}$, $R_*=1.638\pm0.034$ $R_{\odot}$, and $v\sin I_*=146$ km s$^{-1}$,the highest projected rotation velocity of any star known to host a transitinghot Jupiter. The star also appears to be somewhat metal-poor and$\alpha$-enhanced, with [Fe/H]$=-0.405_{-0.033}^{+0.032}$ and[$\alpha$/Fe]$=0.145 \pm 0.053$; these abundances are unusual, but notextraordinary, for a young star with thin-disk kinematics like KELT-21.High-resolution imaging observations revealed the presence of a pair of stellarcompanions to KELT-21, located at a separation of 1.2" and with a combinedcontrast of $\Delta K_S=6.39 \pm 0.06$ with respect to the primary. Althoughthese companions are most likely physically associated with KELT-21, we cannotconfirm this with our current data. If associated, the candidate companionsKELT-21 B and C would each have masses of $\sim0.12$ $M_{\odot}$, a projectedmutual separation of $\sim20$ AU, and a projected separation of $\sim500$ AUfrom KELT-21. KELT-21b may be one of only a handful of known transiting planetsin hierarchical triple stellar systems.

Near-resonance in a system of sub-Neptunes from TESS

  We report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ($TESS$) detection of amulti-planet system orbiting the $V=10.9$ K0 dwarf TOI 125. We find evidencefor up to five planets, with varying confidence. Three high signal-to-noisetransit signals correspond to sub-Neptune-sized planets ($2.76$, $2.79$, and$2.94\ R_{\oplus}$), and we statistically validate the planetary nature of thetwo inner planets ($P_b = 4.65$ days, $P_c = 9.15$ days). With only twotransits observed, we report the outer object ($P_{.03} = 19.98$ days) as ahigh signal-to-noise ratio planet candidate. We also detect a candidatetransiting super-Earth ($1.4\ R_{\oplus}$) with an orbital period of only$12.7$ hours and a candidate Neptune-sized planet ($4.2\ R_{\oplus}$) with aperiod of $13.28$ days, both at low signal-to-noise. This system is amenable tomass determination via radial velocities and transit timing variations, andprovides an opportunity to study planets of similar size while controlling forage and environment. The ratio of orbital periods between TOI 125 b and c($P_c/P_b = 1.97$) is slightly smaller than an exact 2:1 commensurability andis atypical of multiple planet systems from $Kepler$, which show a preferencefor period ratios just $wide$ of first-order period ratios. A dynamicalanalysis refines the allowed parameter space through stability arguments andsuggests that, despite the nearly commensurate periods, the system is unlikelyto be in resonance.

No supernovae associated with two long-duration gamma ray bursts

  It is now accepted that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are producedduring the collapse of a massive star. The standard "collapsar" model predictsthat a broad-lined and luminous Type Ic core-collapse supernova (SN)accompanies every long-duration GRB. This association has been confirmed inobservations of several nearby GRBs. Here we present observations of two nearbylong-duration GRBs that challenge this simple view. In the GRBs 060505 and060614 we demonstrate that no SN emission accompanied these long-durationbursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal SN 1998bwthat accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any Type Ic SN ever observed.Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of thehost galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and showthat the bursts originated in star-forming regions. The absence of a SN to suchdeep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long GRBs andsuggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. From thesupplementary material: Now we have observed SN-less GRBs in star-formingregions, suggesting that a non-detection of a SN does not preclude a massiveprogenitor. The position of the GRB, i.e. in a star-forming region or in anolder component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compactobjects and massive stars as progenitors. In fact, several host galaxies forshort GRBs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxiesof long-duration GRBs. The GRB labels "long" and "short" have become synonymouswith "massive stars" and "other progenitors". These distinctions may need to berelaxed.

A giant planet undergoing extreme ultraviolet irradiation by its hot  massive-star host

  The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planetdepends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands ofextra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found thattransit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known totransit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperatureof ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet isitself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heatdifferential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at thetemperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles themolecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level ofultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to besignificantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we reportobservations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbitalperiod ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host staris at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure theKELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellartype K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus theprimary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likelyatomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extremeultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planetlargely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the hoststar.

Survey of Period Variations of Superhumps in SU UMa-Type Dwarf Novae

  We systematically surveyed period variations of superhumps in SU UMa-typedwarf novae based on newly obtained data and past publications. In manysystems, the evolution of superhump period are found to be composed of threedistinct stages: early evolutionary stage with a longer superhump period,middle stage with systematically varying periods, final stage with a shorter,stable superhump period. During the middle stage, many systems with superhumpperiods less than 0.08 d show positive period derivatives. Contrary to theearlier claim, we found no clear evidence for variation of period derivativesbetween superoutburst of the same object. We present an interpretation that thelengthening of the superhump period is a result of outward propagation of theeccentricity wave and is limited by the radius near the tidal truncation. Weinterpret that late stage superhumps are rejuvenized excitation of 3:1resonance when the superhumps in the outer disk is effectively quenched. Manyof WZ Sge-type dwarf novae showed long-enduring superhumps during thepost-superoutburst stage having periods longer than those during the mainsuperoutburst. The period derivatives in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are found tobe strongly correlated with the fractional superhump excess, or consequently,mass ratio. WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with a long-lasting rebrightening or withmultiple rebrightenings tend to have smaller period derivatives and areexcellent candidate for the systems around or after the period minimum ofevolution of cataclysmic variables (abridged).

KELT-2Ab: A Hot Jupiter Transiting the Bright (V=8.77) Primary Star of a  Binary System

  We report the discovery of KELT-2Ab, a hot Jupiter transiting the bright(V=8.77) primary star of the HD 42176 binary system. The host is a slightlyevolved late F-star likely in the very short-lived "blue-hook" stage ofevolution, with $\teff=6148\pm48{\rm K}$, $\log{g}=4.030_{-0.026}^{+0.015}$ and$\feh=0.034\pm0.78$. The inferred stellar mass is$M_*=1.314_{-0.060}^{+0.063}$\msun\ and the star has a relatively large radiusof $R_*=1.836_{-0.046}^{+0.066}$\rsun. The planet is a typical hot Jupiter withperiod $4.11379\pm0.00001$ days and a mass of $M_P=1.524\pm0.088$\mj\ andradius of $R_P=1.290_{-0.050}^{+0.064}$\rj. This is mildly inflated as comparedto models of irradiated giant planets at the $\sim$4 Gyr age of the system.KELT-2A is the third brightest star with a transiting planet identified byground-based transit surveys, and the ninth brightest star overall with atransiting planet. KELT-2Ab's mass and radius are unique among the subset ofplanets with $V<9$ host stars, and therefore increases the diversity of brightbenchmark systems. We also measure the relative motion of KELT-2A and -2B overa baseline of 38 years, robustly demonstrating for the first time that thestars are bound. This allows us to infer that KELT-2B is an early K-dwarf. Wehypothesize that through the eccentric Kozai mechanism KELT-2B may haveemplaced KELT-2Ab in its current orbit. This scenario is potentially testablewith Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, which should have an amplitude of$\sim$44 m s$^{-1}$.

The L 98-59 System: Three Transiting, Terrestrial-Sized Planets Orbiting  a Nearby M-dwarf

  We report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) discovery of threeterrestrial-sized planets transiting L 98-59 (TOI-175, TIC 307210830) -- abright M dwarf at a distance of 10.6 pc. Using the Gaia-measured distance andbroad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined withthe TESS transits from one sector, the corresponding stellar parameters yieldplanet radii ranging from 0.7 REarth to 1.3 REarth. All three planets haveshort orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair justwide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS DataValidation and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive sources.These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of thesystem, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planetstransiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. TheL 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright(V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for furtherfollow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurementsand future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the nearresonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary systemdynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the samesystem present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where othervariables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant. L 98-59 will beobserved in 6 more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information onthe three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additionalplanets in the system.

Star Cluster Catalogs for the LEGUS Dwarf Galaxies

  We present the star cluster catalogs for 17 dwarf and irregular galaxies inthe $HST$ Treasury Program "Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey" (LEGUS). Clusteridentification and photometry in this subsample are similar to that of theentire LEGUS sample, but special methods were developed to provide robustcatalogs with accurate fluxes due to low cluster statistics. The colors andages are largely consistent for two widely used aperture corrections, but asignificant fraction of the clusters are more compact than the average trainingcluster. However, the ensemble luminosity, mass, and age distributions areconsistent suggesting that the systematics between the two methods are lessthan the random errors. When compared with the clusters from previous dwarfgalaxy samples, we find that the LEGUS catalogs are more complete and providemore accurate total fluxes. Combining all clusters into a composite dwarfgalaxy, we find that the luminosity and mass functions can be described by apower law with the canonical index of $-2$ independent of age and global SFRbinning. The age distribution declines as a power law, with an index of$\approx-0.80\pm0.15$, independent of cluster mass and global SFR binning. Thisdecline of clusters is dominated by cluster disruption since the combined starformation histories and integrated-light SFRs are both approximately constantover the last few hundred Myr. Finally, we find little evidence for anupper-mass cutoff ($<2\sigma$) in the composite cluster mass function, and canrule out a truncation mass below $\approx10^{4.5}$M$_{\odot}$ but cannot ruleout the existence of a truncation at higher masses.

The Afterglows of Swift-era Gamma-Ray Bursts. I. Comparing pre-Swift and  Swift era Long/Soft (Type II) GRB Optical Afterglows

  We have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a largesample of Swift-era gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows including GRBs up toSeptember 2009, for a total of 76 GRBs, and present an additional threepre-Swift GRBs not included in an earlier sample. Furthermore, we publish 840additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 GRB afterglows,including large data sets for GRBs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820A, 050922C,060418, 080413A and 080810. We analyzed the light curves of all GRBs in thesample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the bestdata quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. Wetransformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 systemand compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-Swift afterglows. Theresults of a former study, which showed that GRB afterglows clustered andexhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the largersample. We found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples(Swift-era and pre-Swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which wewere not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the mainsample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight hostextinction. We derived bolometric isotropic energies for all GRBs in oursample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energyrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the GRB in thez=1 system. A comparative study of the optical luminosities of GRB afterglowswith echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)and those without reveals no indication that the former are statisticallysignificantly more luminous.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV: Mapping the Milky Way, Nearby Galaxies, and  the Distant Universe

  We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassingthree major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory GalacticEvolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of MilkyWay stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in thenear-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearbygalaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon OscillationSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gasdistributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology usingbaryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of thepower spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: theSPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-rayAGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meterSloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations therebegan in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infraredspectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities arescheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy,SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, DataRelease 13, was made available in July 2016.

Production and Integration of the ATLAS Insertable B-Layer

  During the shutdown of the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2013-2014, anadditional pixel layer was installed between the existing Pixel detector of theATLAS experiment and a new, smaller radius beam pipe. The motivation for thisnew pixel layer, the Insertable B-Layer (IBL), was to maintain or improve therobustness and performance of the ATLAS tracking system, given the higherinstantaneous and integrated luminosities realised following the shutdown.Because of the extreme radiation and collision rate environment, several newradiation-tolerant sensor and electronic technologies were utilised for thislayer. This paper reports on the IBL construction and integration prior to itsoperation in the ATLAS detector.
