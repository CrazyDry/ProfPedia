Observations and predictions at CesrTA, and outlook for ILC

  In this paper, we will describe some of the recent experimental measurements[1, 2, 3] performed at CESRTA [4], and the supporting simulations, which probethe interaction of the electron cloud with the stored beam. These experimentshave been done over a wide range of beam energies, emittances, bunch currents,and fill patterns, to gather sufficient information to be able to fullycharacterize the beam-electron-cloud interaction and validate the simulationprograms. The range of beam conditions is chosen to be as close as possible tothose of the ILC damping ring, so that the validated simulation programs can beused to predict the performance of these rings with regard to electroncloud-related phenomena. Using the new simulation code Synrad3D to simulate thesynchrotron radiation environment, a vacuum chamber design has been developedfor the ILC damping ring which achieves the required level of photoelectronsuppression. To determine the expected electron cloud density in the ring, ECbuildup simulations have been done based on the simulated radiation environmentand on the expected performance of the ILC damping ring chamber mitigationprescriptions. The expected density has been compared with analytical estimatesof the instability threshold, to verify that the ILC damping ring vacuumchamber design is adequate to suppress the electron cloud single-bunchhead-tail instability.

The Cornell confining potential from spontaneous breaking of scale  symmetry

  We show that one can obtain naturally the Cornell confining potential fromthe spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance in gauge theory. At theclassical level a confining force is obtained and at the quantum level, using agauge invariant but path-dependent variables formalism, the Cornell confiningpotential is explicitly obtained.

A Dynamical Simulation Facility for Hybrid Systems

  This paper establishes a general framework for describing hybrid dynamicalsystems which is particularly suitable for numerical simulation. In thiscontext, the data structures used to describe the sets and functions whichcomprise the dynamical system are crucial since they provide the link between anatural mathematical formulation of a problem and the correct application ofstandard numerical algorithms. We describe a partial implementation of thedesign methodology and use this simulation tool for a specific control problemin robotics as an illustration of the utility of the approach for practicalapplications.

TEDI: the TripleSpec Exoplanet Discovery Instrument

  The TEDI (TripleSpec - Exoplanet Discovery Instrument) will be the firstinstrument fielded specifically for finding low-mass stellar companions. Theinstrument is a near infra-red interferometric spectrometer used as a radialvelocimeter. TEDI joins Externally Dispersed Interferometery (EDI) with anefficient, medium-resolution, near IR (0.9 - 2.4 micron) echelle spectrometer,TripleSpec, at the Palomar 200" telescope. We describe the instrument and itsradial velocimetry demonstration program to observe cool stars.

From Declarative Languages to Declarative Processing in Computer Games

  Recent work has shown that we can dramatically improve the performance ofcomputer games and simulations through declarative processing: Character AI canbe written in an imperative scripting language which is then compiled torelational algebra and executed by a special games engine with features similarto a main memory database system. In this paper we lay out a challengingresearch agenda built on these ideas.  We discuss several research ideas for novel language features to supportatomic actions and reactive programming. We also explore challenges formain-memory query processing in games and simulations including adaptive queryplan selection, support for parallel architectures, debugging simulationscripts, and extensions for multi-player games and virtual worlds. We believethat these research challenges will result in a dramatic change in the designof game engines over the next decade.

Internet Scale Research Studies using SDL-RX

  Medical research is one area where collecting data is usually hard andexpensive. With the launch of ResearchKit, Apple and Sage Bionetworks madelarge-scale personal data collection increasingly popular via simple text-basedsurvey apps running on mobile phones. But such surveys can be a barrier interms of usability and richness of the data being collected. In this paper, wepresent SDL-R X , a powerful software library designed for ResearchKit thatenables study-specific, personalized, and rich visual surveys, for both iOS andAndroid platforms.

"Birds in the Clouds": Adventures in Data Engineering

  Leveraging their eBird crowdsourcing project, the Cornell Lab of Ornithologygenerates sophisticated Spatio-Temporal Exploratory Model (STEM) maps of birdmigrations. Such maps are highly relevant for both scientific and educationalpurposes, but creating them requires advanced modeling techniques that rely onlong and potentially expensive computations.  In this paper, we share our experience porting the eBird STEM data pipelinefrom a physical cluster to the cloud, providing a seamless deployment at alower cost. Using open source tools and cloud "marketplaces", we managed todivide the operating costs by a factor of 6, making it possible to scale ourpipeline on a research budget.

Analytic Solution of Dirac Equation for Extended Cornell Potential Using  the Nikiforov-Uvarov Method

  The extended Cornell potential which the harmonic oscillator potential isincluded in the original Cornell potential. The Dirac equation is solved byreducing the Dirac equation to the form of Schrodinger equation. TheNikiforov-Uvarov method is applied to obtain the energy eigenvalues andcorresponding wave functions. The obtained results are important to calculatemany characteristics of fermion relativistic particles.

Cornell Potential: A Neural Network Approach

  In this study, we solved Schr\"odinger equation with Cornell potential(Coulomb-plus-linear potential) by using neural network approach. Fourdifferent types of Cornell potential were used without a physical relevance.Besides that charmonium and bottomonium spin-averaged spectra were alsocalculated. Obtained results are in good agreement with the reference studies.

Cornell Model Calibration with NRQCD at N$^3$LO

  The typical binding energy of heavy hadron spectroscopy makes the systemaccessible to perturbative calculations in terms of non-relativistic QCD.Within NRQCD the predictions of heavy quarkonium energy levels rely on theaccurate description of the static QCD potential $V_{\rm QCD}(r)$.  Historically, heavy quarkonium spectroscopy was studied usingphenomenological approaches such as the Cornell model $V_{\rmCornell}=-\kappa/r+\sigma\, r$, which assumes a short-distance dominant Coulombpotential plus a liner rising potential that emerges at long distances. Suchmodel works reasonably well in describing the charmonium and bottomoniumspectroscopy. However, even when there are physically-motivated arguments forthe construction of the Cornell model, there is no conection a priori with QCDparameters.  Based on a previous work on heavy meson spectroscopy, we calibrate theCornell model with NRQCD predictions for the lowest lying bottomonium states atN$^3$LO, in which the bottom mass is varied within a wide range. We show thatthe Cornell model mass parameter can be identified with the low-scaleshort-distance MSR mass at the scale $R = 1$ GeV. This identification holds forany value of $\alpha_s$ or the bottom mass. For moderate values of $r$, theNRQCD and Cornell static potentials are in head-on agreement when switching thepole mass to the MSR scheme, which allows to simultaneously cancel therenormalon and sum up large logarithms.

High-precision methods for Coulomb, linear confinement and Cornell  potentials in momentum space

  We use special quadrature formulas for singular and hypersingular integral tonumerically solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in momentum space with thelinear confinement potential, Coulomb and Cornell potentials. It is shown thatthe eigenvalues of the equation can be calculated with high accuracy, farexceeding other calculation methods. Special methods of solution for stateswith zero orbital angular momentum are considered.

Knowledge-Based Synthesis of Distributed Systems Using Event Structures

  To produce a program guaranteed to satisfy a given specification one cansynthesize it from a formal constructive proof that a computation satisfyingthat specification exists. This process is particularly effective if thespecifications are written in a high-level language that makes it easy fordesigners to specify their goals. We consider a high-level specificationlanguage that results from adding knowledge to a fragment of Nuprl specificallytailored for specifying distributed protocols, called event theory. We thenshow how high-level knowledge-based programs can be synthesized from theknowledge-based specifications using a proof development system such as Nuprl.Methods of Halpern and Zuck then apply to convert these knowledge-basedprotocols to ordinary protocols. These methods can be expressed as heuristictransformation tactics in Nuprl.

The extraordinary mid-infrared spectral properties of FeLoBAL Quasars

  We present mid-infrared spectra of six FeLoBAL QSOs at 1<z<1.8, taken withthe Spitzer space telescope. The spectra span a range of shapes, from hot dustdominated AGN with silicate emission at 9.7 microns, to moderately obscuredstarbursts with strong Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. Thespectrum of one object, SDSS 1214-0001, shows the most prominent PAHs yet seenin any QSO at any redshift, implying that the starburst dominates the mid-IRemission with an associated star formation rate of order 2700 solar masses peryear. With the caveats that our sample is small and not robustly selected, wecombine our mid-IR spectral diagnostics with previous observations to proposethat FeLoBAL QSOs are at least largely comprised of systems in which (a) amerger driven starburst is ending, (b) a luminous AGN is in the last stages ofburning through its surrounding dust, and (c) which we may be viewing over arestricted line of sight range.

Quark-antiquark potential from a deformed AdS/QCD

  In this work we calculate the static limit of the energy for aquark-antiquark pair from the Nambu-Goto action using a holographic approachwith a deformed AdS space, with warp factor $\exp\{(\kappa z)^n/n\}$.  From this energy we derive the Cornell potential for the quark-antiquarkinteraction. We also find a range of values for our parameters which fitsexactly the Cornell potential parameters. In particular, setting the zeroenergy of the Cornell potential at 0.33 fermi, we find that $\kappa=0.56$ GeVand $n=1.3$.

Calibrating the Naïve Cornell Model with NRQCD

  Building on results from a previous study on heavy meson spectroscopy, wecalibrate the Cornell model employing NRQCD predictions for the lowest-lyingbottomonium states up to N$^3$LO, in which the bottom mass is varied within awide range. We find that the Cornell model mass parameter can be identified,within perturbative uncertainties, with the MSR mass at the scale $R = 1\,$GeV.This identification holds for any value of $\alpha_s$ or the bottom mass, andfor all perturbative orders investigated. Furthermore we show that: a) the`string tension' parameter is independent of the bottom mass, and b) theCoulomb strength $\kappa$ of the Cornell model can be related to the QCD strongcoupling constant $\alpha_s$ at a characteristic non-relativistic scale. Wealso show how to remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon of the static QCD potential andsum-up large logs related to the renormalon subtraction by switching to thelow-scale, short-distance MSR mass, and using R-evolution. Our R-improvedexpression for the static potential remains independent of the heavy quark massvalue and agrees with lattice QCD results for values of the radius as large as$0.8\,$fm, and with the Cornell model potential at long distances.

Generalized gradient approximations to density functional theory:  comparison with exact results

  In order to assess the accuracy of commonly used approximateexchange-correlation density functionals, we present a comparison of accurateexchange and correlation potentials, exchange energy densities and energycomponents with the corresponding approximate quantities. Four systems are usedas illustrative examples: the model system of two electrons in a harmonicpotential and the He, Be and Ne atoms. A new ingredient in the paper is theseparation of the exchange-correlation potential into exchange and correlationaccording to the density functional theory definition.

Monte Carlo Eigenvalue Methods in Quantum Mechanics and Statistical  Mechanics

  In this review we discuss, from a unified point of view, a variety of MonteCarlo methods used to solve eigenvalue problems in statistical mechanics andquantum mechanics. Although the applications of these methods differ widely,the underlying mathematics is quite similar in that they are stochasticimplementations of the power method. In all cases, optimized trial states canbe used to reduce the errors of Monte Carlo estimates.

TeV-scale electron Compton scattering in the Randall-Sundrum scenario

  The spin-2 graviton excitations in the Randall-Sundrum gravity model providesa t-channel contribution to electron Compton scattering which competesfavourably with the standard QED contributions. The phenomenologicalimplications of these contributions to the unpolarized and polarizedcross-sections are evaluated.

Weak Scale Quantum Gravity Effects for $γγ\to ZZ$ in the TeV  region

  We consider the effect of massive spin-2 gravitons that occur as Kaluza-Kleinexcitations of the graviton in a Weak scale Quantum Gravity scenario on theprocess $\gamma \gamma \to ZZ$, which in the Standard Model can proceed throughloop diagrams. For a wide range of parameters, we show that the massivegravitons leave behind signatures that should be verifiable in a TeV scalescattering experiment.

External Operators and Anomalous Dimensions in Soft-Collinear Effective  Theory

  It has recently been argued that soft-collinear effective theory forprocesses involving both soft and collinear partons contains a newsoft-collinear mode, which can communicate between the soft and collinearsectors of the theory. The formalism incorporating the corresponding fieldsinto the effective Lagrangian is extended to include external current andfour-quark operators relevant to weak interactions. An explicit calculation ofthe anomalous dimensions of these operators reveals that soft-collinear modesare needed for correctly describing the ultraviolet behavior of the effectivetheory.

FB asymmetries in the $B \to K^* \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay: A model  independent approach

  Among the various "rare" semi-leptonic decays of $B$-mesons the $B \to K^*\ell^+ \ell^-$ mode is of special interest. This is because it has the highestbranching ratio among all the semi-leptonic B decays within the SM. Thischannel also provides us with a very large number of possible observables, suchas the Forward Backward (FB) asymmetry, lepton polarization asymmetry etc. Ofspecial interest is the zero which the FB asymmetry has in this decay mode. Inthis work we have studied this zero in the most general model independentframework.

CP violation in the $B \to K \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay

  Standard Model (SM) CP asymmetries in $B \to K \ell^+ \ell^-$ are expected tobe very small. This feature could help in the understanding of new physicsscenarios which predict the existence of CP odd phases in various Wilsoncoefficients. In this paper we have analyzed the $B \to K \ell^+ \ell^-$ decayin beyond the SM scenarios where the Wilson coefficients have new CP oddphases. The sensitivity of the CP asymmetries on these new weak phases isdiscussed.

Forest diagrams for elements of Thompson's group F

  We introduce forest diagrams to represent elements of Thompson's group F.These diagrams relate to a certain action of F on the real line in the same waythat tree diagrams relate to the standard action of F on the unit interval.Using forest diagrams, we give a conceptually simple length formula forelements of F with respect to the {x_0,x_1} generating set, and we discuss theconstruction of minimum-length words for positive elements. Finally, we useforest diagrams and the length formula to examine the structure of the Cayleygraph of F.

Random walk loop soup

  The Brownian loop soup introduced in Lawler and Werner (2004) is a Poissonianrealization from a sigma-finite measure on unrooted loops. This measuresatisfies both conformal invariance and a restriction property. In this paper,we define a random walk loop soup and show that it converges to the Brownianloop soup. In fact, we give a strong approximation result making use of thestrong approximation result of Koml\'os, Major, and Tusn\'ady. To make thepaper self-contained, we include a proof of the approximation result that weneed.

Unramified reductors of filtered and graded algebras

  It is a fairly known fact that most of the algebras appearing in the theoryof rings of differential operators, quantized algebras of different kinds(including many quantum groups), regular algebras in projective non-commutativegeometry, etc... come equipped with a natural gradation or filtrationcontrolled by some finite dimensional vector space(s), e.g. the degree one partof filtration or gradation. In this note we relate the valuations of thealgebras considered to unramified sub-lattices in some vector space(s).

$V_{(1,1)}^{(t)}$-PERTURBED MODELS OF CFT AND THEIR QUANTUM GROUP  SYMMETRY

  We propose a new massive integrable model in quantum field theory. This modelis obtained as a perturbed model of the minimal conformal field theories on thehyper-elliptic surfaces by a particular relavant operator $V_{(1,1)}^{(t)}$.The non-local conserved charges of the model and their $q$-deformed algebra arealso constructed explicitly.

Integrable Models on Hyper-Elliptic Surfaces

  We present an elementary introduction to the construction of integrablemodels on hyper-elliptic surfaces for non specialists; also, we present some ofthe details of the paper `solv-int/9504002' for the more interested readers.(Based on a talk given at the MRST 95 meeting by C. E.)

Lepton Flavour Violation in Unparticle Physics

  Recently H. Georgi has introduced an unparticle $\unpart$ in order todescribe the low energy physics of a nontrivial scale invariant sector of aneffective theory. In this work we have explored the phenomenology of anunparticle using the lepton flavour violating decay $\mu^{-}\to e^{-} e^{+}e^{-}$, and found that the branching ratio of this decay is strongly dependenton the scaling dimension.

B \to K(K^*) missing energy in Unparticle physics

  In the present work we study the effects of an unparticle $\unpart$ as thepossible source of missing energy in the decay $B \to K (K^*) + {\rm missingenergy}$. We find that the dependence of the differential branching ratio onthe $K$($K^*$)-meson's energy in the presence of the vector unparticleoperators is very distinctive from that of the SM. Moreover, in using theexisting upper bound on $B \to K (K^*) + {\rm missing energy}$ decays, we havebeen able to put more stringent constraints on the parameters of unparticlestuff.

Cornell Potential Parameters for S-wave Heavy Quarkonia

  We compute derived quantities for various values of the model parameter ofthe Cornell potential model for the S-wave heavy quarkonia with radial quantumnumbers n=1, 2, and 3. Our results can be used to determine leading andrelative-order-v^2 nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics matrix elements forS-wave charmonia and bottomonia such as psi(2S), eta_c(2S), and Upsilon(nS) forn=1, 2, and 3. These matrix elements will be essential ingredients forresumming relativistic corrections to processes involving those S-wave heavyquarkonium states.

Improved variational approach for the Cornell potential

  The approximate radial wave functions for the Cornell potential describingquark-antiquark interaction are constructed in the framework of a variationalmethod. The optimal values of the variational parameters are fixed by thefulfillment of the requirements of the virial theorem and the minimalitycondition for integral discrepancy. The results of calculation with the simpletrial function are in a good agreement with exact numerical results.

Analysis of the ${\bar B} \to {\bar K}_2(1430) \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay

  We present an analysis of the decay process ${\bar B} \to {\bar K}_2(1430)\ell^+ \ell^-$, where this process has all the features of the related and wellinvestigated process ${\bar B} \to {\bar K}^*(890) \ell^+ \ell^-$, withtheoretically comparable branching ratios. The differential decay rate as wellas the forward-backward asymmetry are worked out, where the sensitivity ofthese to possible right-handed couplings for the related $b \to s$ radiativedecay are also investigated.
