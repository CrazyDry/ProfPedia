  This manifesto provides a vision of how computers can be used to bring peopletogether, to enhance people's use of their natural creativity, and thus, makethem happier.

Ideas Behind Kolmogorov Complexity and Related Kolmogorov's Ideas about  The Physical Impossibility of Large Integers: How Their Formalization Can  Help in Foundations of Physics

  In addition to the equations, physicists use the following additionaldifficult-to-formalize property: that the initial conditions and the value ofthe parameters must not be abnormal. We will describe a natural formalizationof this property, and show that this formalization in good accordance withtheoretical physics. At present, this formalization has been mainly applied tothe foundations of physics. However, potentially, more practical applicationsare possible.

An operationalistic reformulation of Einstein's equivalence principle

  The Einstein's equivalence principle is formulated in terms of the accuracyof measurements and its dependence of the size of the area of measurement. Itis shown that different refinements of the statement 'the spacetime is locallyflat' lead to different conculsions about the spacetime geometry.

Dimension Compactification -- a Possible Explanation for Superclusters  and for Empirical Evidence Usually Interpreted as Dark Matter

  According to modern quantum physics, at the microlevel, the dimension ofspace-time is at least 11; we only observe 4 dimensions because the others arecompactified: the size along each of the other dimensions is much smaller thanthe macroscale. There is no universally accepted explanation of why exactly 4dimensions remain at the microscopic level. A natural suggestion is: maybethere is no fundamental reason why exactly 4 dimensions should remain, maybewhen we go to even larger scales, some of the 4 dimensions will be compactifiedas well? In this paper, we explore the consequences of the compactificationsuggestion, and we show that -- on the qualitative level -- these consequenceshave actually been already observed: as superclusters and as evidence that isusually interpreted as justifying dark matter. Thus, we get a new possibleexplanation of both superclusters and dark matter evidence -- via dimensioncompactification.

Kaluza-Klein 5D Ideas Made Fully Geometric

  After the 1916 success of General relativity that explained gravity by addingtime as a fourth dimension, physicists have been trying to explain otherphysical fields by adding extra dimensions. In 1921, Kaluza and Klein has shownthat under certain conditions like cylindricity ($\partial g_{ij}/\partialx^5=0$), the addition of the 5th dimension can explain the electromagneticfield. The problem with this approach is that while the model itself isgeometric, conditions like cylindricity are not geometric. This problem waspartly solved by Einstein and Bergman who proposed, in their 1938 paper, thatthe 5th dimension is compactified into a small circle $S^1$ so that in theresulting cylindric 5D space-time $R^4\times S^1$ the dependence on $x^5$ isnot macroscopically noticeable. We show that if, in all definitions of vectors,tensors, etc., we replace $R^4$ with $R^4\times S^1$, then conditions likecylindricity automatically follow -- i.e., these conditions become fullygeometric.

On Selecting a Conjunction Operation in Probabilistic Soft Logic

  Probabilistic Soft Logic has been proposed and used in several applicationsas an efficient way to deal with inconsistency, uncertainty and relationalrepresentation. In several applications, this approach has led to an adequatedescription of the corresponding human reasoning. In this paper, we provide atheoretical explanation for one of the semi-heuristic choices made in thisapproach: namely, we explain the choice of the corresponding conjunctionoperations. Our explanation leads to a more general family of operations whichmay be used in future applications of probabilistic soft logic.

A New Kalman Filter Model for Nonlinear Systems Based on Ellipsoidal  Bounding

  In this paper, a new filter model called set-membership Kalman filter fornonlinear state estimation problems was designed, where both random and unknownbut bounded uncertainties were considered simultaneously in the discrete-timesystem. The main loop of this algorithm includes one prediction step and onecorrection step with measurement information, and the key part in each loop isto solve an optimization problem. The solution of the optimization problemproduces the optimal estimation for the state, which is bounded by ellipsoids.The new filter was applied on a highly nonlinear benchmark example and atwo-dimensional simulated trajectory estimation problem, in which the newfilter behaved better compared with extended Kalman filter results. Sensitivityof the algorithm was discussed in the end.
