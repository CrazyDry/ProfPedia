MUFold-SS: Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Using Deep  Inception-Inside-Inception Networks

  Motivation: Protein secondary structure prediction can provide importantinformation for protein 3D structure prediction and protein functions. Deeplearning, which has been successfully applied to various research fields suchas image classification and voice recognition, provides a new opportunity tosignificantly improve the secondary structure prediction accuracy. Althoughseveral deep-learning methods have been developed for secondary structureprediction, there is room for improvement. MUFold-SS was developed to addressthese issues. Results: Here, a very deep neural network, the deepinception-inside-inception networks (Deep3I), is proposed for protein secondarystructure prediction and a software tool was implemented using this network.This network takes two inputs: a protein sequence and a profile generated byPSI-BLAST. The output is the predicted eight states (Q8) or three states (Q3)of secondary structures. The proposed Deep3I not only achieves thestate-of-the-art performance but also runs faster than other tools. Deep3Iachieves Q3 82.8% and Q8 71.1% accuracies on the CB513 benchmark.

A Finite-temperature First-principles Approach to Spin Fluctuation in  BaFe_2As_2

  Thermodynamic flunctuations in BaFe2As2 is addressed with a first-principlesformulation of the Helmholtz energy by accounting for the mixture of variouselectronic states each distinguished by different spin orientationdistributions. We find that it is the spin exchange coupling in the inter-planec direction that dictates the spin density wave ordering. We quantitativelypredicted the pressure dependence of the spin density wave ordering, theSchottky anomaly, and the temperature dependence of thermal populations of spinstructures, all in agreement with available experimental data.

Problems with twilight/supersky flat-field for wide-field robotic  telescopes and the solution

  Twilight/night sky images are often used for flat-fielding CCD images, butthe brightness gradient in twilight/night sky causes problems of accurateflat-field correction in astronomical images for wide-field telescopes. Usingdata from the Antarctic Survey Telescope (AST3), we found that when the skybrightness gradient is minimum and stable, there is still a gradient of 1%across AST3's field-of-view of 4.3 square degrees. We tested various approachesto remove the varying gradients in individual flat-field images. Our finaloptimal method can reduce the spatially dependent errors caused by the gradientto the negligible level. We also suggest a guideline of flat-fielding usingtwilight/night sky images for wide-field robotic autonomous telescopes.

Complementary relation of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in  multiple measurements

  Quantum coherence and quantum correlations lie in the center of quantuminformation science, since they both are considered as fundamental reasons forsignificant features of quantum mechanics different from classical mechanics.We present a group of complementary relations for quantum coherence and quantumcorrelations; specifically, we focus on thermal discord and conditionalinformation in scenarios of multiple measurements. We show that the summationof quantum coherence quantified in different bases has a lower bound, resultingfrom entropic uncertainty relations with multiple measurements. Similar resultsare also obtained for thermal discord and for post-measurement conditionalinformation with multiple measurements in a multipartite system. These resultsindicate the general applications of the uncertainty principle to variousconcepts of quantum information.

A First-principles approach to predict Seebeck coefficients: Application  to La3-xTe4

  Theoretical descriptions of the Seebeck coefficient in terms of thedifferential electrical conductivity given by Cutler and Mott is the foundationof later works in terms of transmission function from the thermoelectrictransport theory. On the other hand, recent studies in the literature haveshown the relation between the Seebeck coefficient and chemical potential ofelectrons. In this work, this relation is rigorously derived from fundamentalthermodynamics, and an formalism for the parameter-free calculation of theSeebeck coefficient based on the electronic density-of-states fromfirst-principles calculations is presented. Numerical results are given usingthe n-type La3-xTe4 thermoelectric material as the prototype. With the rigidband approximation, the calculated temperature dependences of the Seebeckcoefficients of La3-xTe4 as a function of carrier concentration show excellentagreements with experimental data.

First-Principles Thermodynamic Theory of Seebeck Coefficients

  Thermoelectric effects, measured by the Seebeck coefficients, refer to thephenomena in which a temperature difference or gradient imposed across athermoelectric material induces an electrical potential difference or gradient,and vice versa, enabling the direct conversion of thermal and electricenergies. All existing understanding and first-principles calculations ofSeebeck coefficients have been based on the Boltzmann kinetic transport theory.Here we demonstrate that the Seebeck coefficient is a well-definedthermodynamic quantity that can be determined from the change in the chemicalpotential of electrons induced by the temperature change and thus can beefficiently computed solely based on the electronic density of states throughfirst-principles calculations at different temperatures. The proposed approachis demonstrated using the prototype PbTe and SnSe thermoelectric materials. Theproposed thermodynamic approach dramatically simplifies the calculations ofSeebeck coefficients, making it possible to search for high performancethermoelectric materials using high-throughput first-principles calculations.

Single photon transmission in strong three-mode optomechanical  circulatory system

  In the few-photon regime, we theoretically propose a feasible scheme torealize strong coupling optomechanical cycle in a three-mode optomechanicalcirculatory system (OMCS) comprising of cross-Kerr (CK) type and linearcoupling between the corresponding two bosonic modes, meanwhile, where one ofthe bosonic modes is strongly coherently driven and the rest are weakly driven.A Langevin equation for strong three-mode OMCS is derived by adjusting theparameters of the appropriate strong coherent laser. We show that this strongcoupling of optomechanical originates from the strong coherently driven the CKcoupling modes, thereby, in coherent state displacement representation enhancethe optomechanical coupling and present the strengthen of the nonolinearity. Weobtain a set of optimal parameters by full numerical simulation of dynamicsmatrix, under this condition, minimal strong OMCS that exhibit a single photonperfect non-reciprocal transmission between the two optical modes, andunidirectional transportation inter the optomechanical modes. For a detectionfield, the system presents optomechanical induced transparency (OMIT) behavior.The presented results can be widely applied to quantum devices such ascirculators, diodes, and transistors. Moreover, we brief analysis that a systemwhich consisting of dual mechanical modes and one optical mode, further extendthe system to a generalized coupled one-dimensional optomechanical array andarbitrary modes optomechanical loop network. Experimentally, the system hasbeen demonstrated to be achieved through a variety of experimental protocolsand configurations, for example optomechanical crystal and integrated quantumsuperconducting circuit.

A new method of CCD dark current correction via extracting the dark  information from scientific images

  We have developed a new method to correct dark current at relatively hightemperatures for Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) images when dark frames cannot beobtained on the telescope. For images taken with the Antarctic SurveyTelescopes (AST3) in 2012, due to the low cooling efficiency, the median CCDtemperature was -46$^\circ$C, resulting in a high dark current level of about3$e^-$/pix/sec, even comparable to the sky brightness (10$e^-$/pix/sec). If notcorrected, the nonuniformity of the dark current could even overweight thephoton noise of the sky background. However, dark frames could not be obtainedduring the observing season because the camera was operated in frame-transfermode without a shutter, and the telescope was unattended in winter. Here wepresent an alternative, but simple and effective method to derive the darkcurrent frame from the scientific images. Then we can scale this dark frame tothe temperature at which the scientific images were taken, and apply the darkframe corrections to the scientific images. We have applied this method to theAST3 data, and demonstrated that it can reduce the noise to a level roughly aslow as the photon noise of the sky brightness, solving the high noise problemand improving the photometric precision. This method will also be helpful forother projects that suffer from similar issues.

The nonlinear photon transfer curve of CCDs and its effects on  photometry

  The photon transfer curve (PTC, variance vs. signal level) is a commonly usedand effective tool in characterizing CCD performance. It is theoreticallylinear in the range where photon shot noise dominates, and its slope isutilized to derive the gain of the CCD. However, recent researches on differentCCDs have revealed that the variance progressively drops at high signal levels,while the linearity shown by signal versus exposure time is still excellent andunaffected. On the other hand, bright stars are found to exhibit fatter pointspread function (PSF). Both nonlinear PTC and the brighter-fatter effect areregarded as the result of spreading of charges between pixels, an interactionprogress increasing with signal level. In this work we investigate thenonlinear PTC based on the images with a STA1600FT CCD camera, whose PTC startsto become nonlinear at about 1/3 full well. To explain the phenomenon, wepresent a model to characterize the charge-sharing PSF. This signal-dependentPSF can be derived from flat-field frames, and allow us to quantify the effectson photometry and measured shape of stars. This effect is essentially criticalfor projects requiring accurate photometry and shape parameters.

Meteorological data for the astronomical site at Dome A, Antarctica

  We present an analysis of the meteorological data collected at Dome A,Antarctica by the Kunlun Automated Weather Station, including temperatures andwind speeds at eight elevations above the snow surface between 0m and 14.5m.The average temperatures at 2m and 14.5m are $-54^{\circ}$C and $-46^{\circ}$C,respectively. We find that a strong temperature inversion existed at allheights for more than 70% of the time, and the temperature inversion typicallylasts longer than 25 hours, indicating an extremely stable atmosphere. Thetemperature gradient is larger at lower elevations than higher elevations. Theaverage wind speed was 1.5m/s at 4m elevation. We find that the temperatureinversion is stronger when the wind speed is lower and the temperature gradientdecreases sharply at a specific wind speed for each elevation. The strongtemperature inversion and low wind speed results in a shallow and stableboundary layer with weak atmospheric turbulence above it, suggesting that DomeA should be an excellent site for astronomical observations. All the data fromthe weather station are available for download.

Meteorological data from KLAWS-2G for an astronomical site survey of  Dome A, Antarctica

  We present an analysis of meteorological data from the second generation ofthe Kunlun Automated Weather Station (KLAWS-2G) at Dome A, Antarctica during2015 and 2016. We find that a strong temperature inversion exists for all theelevations up to 14 m that KLAWS-2G can reach, and lasts for more than 10 hoursfor 50% or more of the time when temperature inversion occurs. The average windspeeds at 4 m elevation are 4.2 m/s and 3.8 m/s during 2015 and 2016,respectively. The strong temperature inversion and moderate wind speed lead toa shallow turbulent boundary layer height at Dome A. By analyzing thetemperature and wind shear profiles, we note telescopes should be elevated byat least 8 m above the ice. We also find that the duration of temperatureinversions, and the wind speed, vary considerably from year to year. Therefore,long-term and continuous data are still needed for the site survey at Dome A.

Thermodynamic Fluctuations in Magnetic Phase Transition: Invar as a  Prototype

  We propose a first-principles formulism for system with spin fluctuations andapply it to the ordered Fe3Pt to uncover the Invar anomalies, includingnegative thermal expansion and spontaneous magnetization. The theory hascoherently predicted the finite temperature intermixing between the fullyferromagnetic configuration and the spin-flipping configurations. We alsodiscover a tri-critical point at which a high-temperature second-order phasetransition, between the fully ferromagnetic configuration and the spin-flippingconfigurations, becomes first-order at low temperatures.

All passive photonic power divider with arbitrary split ratio

  Integrated optical power splitter is one of the fundamental building blocksin photonic integrated circuits (PIC). Conventional multimode interferometerbased power splitter is widely used as it has reasonable footprint and is easyto fabricate. However, it is challenging to realize arbitrary split ratioespecially for multi-outputs. In this work, an ultra-compact power splitterwith a QR code-like nanostructure is designed by a nonlinear fast search method(FSM). The highly functional structure is composed of a number of freelydesigned square pixels with the size of 120nm x 120nm which could be eitherdielectric or air. The lightwaves are scattered by a number of etched squareswith optimized locations and the scattered waves superimpose at the outputswith the desired power ratio. We demonstrate 1x2 splitters with 1:1, 1:2, 1:3split ratios and a 1x3 splitter with the ratio of 1:2:1. The footprint for allthe devices is only 3.6umx3.6 um. Well-controlled split ratios are measured forall the cases. The measured transmission efficiencies of all the splitters areclose to 80% over 30 nm wavelength range.

Improving Protein Gamma-Turn Prediction Using Inception Capsule Networks

  Protein gamma-turn prediction is useful in protein function studies andexperimental design. Several methods for gamma-turn prediction have beendeveloped, but the results were unsatisfactory with Matthew correlationcoefficients (MCC) around 0.2-0.4. One reason for the low prediction accuracyis the limited capacity of the methods; in particular, the traditionalmachine-learning methods like SVM may not extract high-level features well todistinguish between turn or non-turn. Hence, it is worthwhile exploring newmachine-learning methods for the prediction. A cutting-edge deep neuralnetwork, named Capsule Network (CapsuleNet), provides a new opportunity forgamma-turn prediction. Even when the number of input samples is relativelysmall, the capsules from CapsuleNet are very effective to extract high-levelfeatures for classification tasks. Here, we propose a deep inception capsulenetwork for gamma-turn prediction. Its performance on the gamma-turn benchmarkGT320 achieved an MCC of 0.45, which significantly outperformed the previousbest method with an MCC of 0.38. This is the first gamma-turn prediction methodutilizing deep neural networks. Also, to our knowledge, it is the firstpublished bioinformatics application utilizing capsule network, which willprovides a useful example for the community.

MUFold-BetaTurn: A Deep Dense Inception Network for Protein Beta-Turn  Prediction

  Beta-turn prediction is useful in protein function studies and experimentaldesign. Although recent approaches using machine-learning techniques such asSVM, neural networks, and K-NN have achieved good results for beta-turnpre-diction, there is still significant room for improvement. As previouspredictors utilized features in a sliding window of 4-20 residues to captureinteractions among sequentially neighboring residues, such feature engineeringmay result in incomplete or biased features, and neglect interactions amonglong-range residues. Deep neural networks provide a new opportunity to addressthese issues. Here, we proposed a deep dense inception network (DeepDIN) forbeta-turn prediction, which takes advantages of the state-of-the-art deepneural network design of the DenseNet and the inception network. A test on arecent BT6376 benchmark shows that the DeepDIN outperformed the previous bestBetaTPred3 significantly in both the overall prediction accuracy and thenine-type beta-turn classification. A tool, called MUFold-BetaTurn, wasdeveloped, which is the first beta-turn prediction tool utilizing deep neuralnetworks. The tool can be downloaded athttp://dslsrv8.cs.missouri.edu/~cf797/MUFoldBetaTurn/download.html.

Salience Biased Loss for Object Detection in Aerial Images

  Object detection in remote sensing, especially in aerial images, remains achallenging problem due to low image resolution, complex backgrounds, andvariation of scale and angles of objects in images. In current implementations,multi-scale based and angle-based networks have been proposed and generatepromising results with aerial image detection. In this paper, we propose anovel loss function, called Salience Biased Loss (SBL), for deep neuralnetworks, which uses salience information of the input image to achieveimproved performance for object detection. Our novel loss function treatstraining examples differently based on input complexity in order to avoid theover-contribution of easy cases in the training process. In our experiments,RetinaNet was trained with SBL to generate an one-stage detector,SBL-RetinaNet. SBL-RetinaNet is applied to the largest existing public aerialimage dataset, DOTA. Experimental results show our proposed loss function withthe RetinaNet architecture outperformed other state-of-art object detectionmodels by at least 4.31 mAP, and RetinaNet by 2.26 mAP with the same inferencespeed of RetinaNet.

The First Release of the AST3-1 Point Source Catalogue from Dome A,  Antarctica

  The three Antarctic Survey Telescopes (AST3) aim to carry out time domainimaging survey at Dome A, Antarctica. The first of the three telescopes(AST3-1) was successfully deployed on January 2012. AST3-1 is a 500\,mmaperture modified Schmidt telescope with a 680\,mm diameter primary mirror.AST3-1 is equipped with a SDSS $i$ filter and a 10k $\times$ 10k frame transferCCD camera, reduced to 5k $\times$ 10k by electronic shuttering, resulting in a4.3 deg$^2$ field-of-view. To verify the capability of AST3-1 for a variety ofscience goals, extensive commissioning was carried out between March and May2012. The commissioning included a survey covering 2000 deg$^2$ as well as theentire Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Frequent repeated images were made ofthe center of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a selected exoplanet transit field,and fields including some Wolf-Rayet stars. Here we present the data reductionand photometric measurements of the point sources observed by AST3-1. We haveachieved a survey depth of 19.3\,mag in 60 s exposures with 5\,mmag precisionin the light curves of bright stars. The facility achieves sub-mmag photometricprecision under stable survey conditions, approaching its photon noise limit.These results demonstrate that AST3-1 at Dome A is extraordinarily competitivein time-domain astronomy, including both quick searches for faint transientsand the detection of tiny transit signals.

Edge Attention-based Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Networks

  Graph convolutional network (GCN) is generalization of convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) to work with arbitrarily structured graphs. A binary adjacencymatrix is commonly used in training a GCN. Recently, the attention mechanismallows the network to learn a dynamic and adaptive aggregation of theneighborhood. We propose a new GCN model on the graphs where edges arecharacterized in multiple views or precisely in terms of multiplerelationships. For instance, in chemical graph theory, compound structures areoften represented by the hydrogen-depleted molecular graph where nodescorrespond to atoms and edges correspond to chemical bonds. Multiple attributescan be important to characterize chemical bonds, such as atom pair (the typesof atoms that a bond connects), aromaticity, and whether a bond is in a ring.The different attributes lead to different graph representations for the samemolecule. There is growing interests in both chemistry and machine learningfields to directly learn molecular properties of compounds from the moleculargraph, instead of from fingerprints predefined by chemists. The proposed GCNmodel, which we call edge attention-based multi-relational GCN (EAGCN), jointlylearns attention weights and node features in graph convolution. For each bondattribute, a real-valued attention matrix is used to replace the binaryadjacency matrix. By designing a dictionary for the edge attention, and formingthe attention matrix of each molecule by looking up the dictionary, the EAGCNexploits correspondence between bonds in different molecules. The prediction ofcompound properties is based on the aggregated node features, which isindependent of the varying molecule (graph) size. We demonstrate the efficacyof the EAGCN on multiple chemical datasets: Tox21, HIV, Freesolv, andLipophilicity, and interpret the resultant attention weights.

Monte Carlo sampling from the quantum state space. II

  High-quality random samples of quantum states are needed for a variety oftasks in quantum information and quantum computation. Searching thehigh-dimensional quantum state space for a global maximum of an objectivefunction with many local maxima or evaluating an integral over a region in thequantum state space are but two exemplary applications of many. These tasks canonly be performed reliably and efficiently with Monte Carlo methods, whichinvolve good samplings of the parameter space in accordance with the relevanttarget distribution. We show how the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method known asHamiltonian Monte Carlo, or hybrid Monte Carlo, can be adapted to this context.It is applicable when an efficient parameterization of the state space isavailable. The resulting random walk is entirely inside the physical parameterspace, and the Hamiltonian dynamics enable us to take big steps, therebyavoiding strong correlations between successive sample points while enjoying ahigh acceptance rate. We use examples of single and double qubit measurementsfor illustration.

Pressure-induced quantum phase transitions in topological insulator YbB6

  Topological insulators (TIs) containing 4f electrons have recently attractedintensive interests due to the possible interplay of their non-trivialtopological properties and strong electronic correlations. YbB6 and SmB6 arethe prototypical systems with such unusual properties, which may be tuned byexternal pressure to give rise to new emergent phenomena. Here, we report thefirst observation, through in-situ high pressure resistance, Hall, X-raydiffraction and X-ray absorption measurements, of two pressure-induced quantumphase transitions (QPTs) in YbB6. Our data revealthat the two insulating phasesare separated by a metallic phase due to the pressure-driven valence change ofYb f-orbitals. In combination with previous studies, our results suggest thatthe two insulating states may be topologically different in nature andoriginate from the d-p and d-f hybridization, respectively. The tunabletopological properties of YbB6 revealed in this study may shed light on theintriguing correlation between the topology and the 4f electrons from theperspective of pressure dependent studies.

Variable Stars Observed in the Galactic Disk by AST3-1 from Dome A,  Antarctica

  AST3-1 is the second-generation wide-field optical photometric telescopededicated to time domain astronomy at Dome A, Antarctica. Here we present theresults of $i$ band images survey from AST3-1 towards one Galactic disk field.Based on time-series photometry of 92,583 stars, 560 variable stars weredetected with $i$ magnitude $\leq$ 16.5 mag during eight days of observations;339 of these are previously unknown variables. We tentatively classify the 560variables as 285 eclipsing binaries (EW, EB, EA), 27 pulsating variable stars($\delta$~Scuti, $\gamma$~Doradus, $\delta$~Cephei variable and RR Lyrae stars)and 248 other types of variables (unclassified periodic, multi-periodic andaperiodic variable stars). Among the eclipsing binaries, 34 show O'Connelleffects. One of the aperiodic variables shows a plateau light curve and anotherone shows a secondary maximum after peak brightness. We also detected a complexbinary system with RS CVn-like light curve morphology; this object is beingfollowed-up spectroscopically using the Gemini South telescope.

The process of 3D-printed skull models for the anatomy education

  Objective The 3D printed medical models can come from virtual digitalresources, like CT scanning. Nevertheless, the accuracy of CT scanningtechnology is limited, which is 1mm. In this situation, the collected data isnot exactly the same as the real structure and there might be some errorscausing the print to fail. This study presents a common and practical way toprocess the skull data to make the structures correctly. And then we make askull model through 3D printing technology, which is useful for medicalstudents to understand the complex structure of skull. Materials and MethodsThe skull data is collected by the CT scan. To get a corrected medical model,the computer-assisted image processing goes with the combination of five 3Dmanipulation tools: Mimics, 3ds Max, Geomagic, Mudbox and Meshmixer, toreconstruct the digital model and repair it. Subsequently, we utilize alow-cost desktop 3D printer, Ultimaker2, with polylactide filament (PLA)material to print the model and paint it based on the atlas. Result After therestoration and repairing, we eliminate the errors and repair the model byadding the missing parts of the uploaded data within 6 hours. Then we print itand compare the model with the cadaveric skull from frontal, left, right andanterior views respectively. The printed model can show the same structures andalso the details of the skull clearly and is a good alternative of thecadaveric skull.

Optical Observations of LIGO Source GW 170817 by the Antarctic Survey  Telescopes at Dome A, Antarctica

  The LIGO detection of gravitational waves (GW) from merging black holes in2015 marked the beginning of a new era in observational astronomy. Thedetection of an electromagnetic signal from a GW source is the critical nextstep to explore in detail the physics involved. The Antarctic Survey Telescopes(AST3), located at Dome A, Antarctica, is uniquely situated for rapid responsetime-domain astronomy with its continuous night-time coverage during theaustral winter. We report optical observations of the GW source (GW~170817) inthe nearby galaxy NGC 4993 using AST3. The data show a rapidly fading transientat around 1 day after the GW trigger, with the $i$-band magnitude decliningfrom $17.23\pm0.13$ magnitude to $17.72\pm0.09$ magnitude in $\sim 1.8$ hour.The brightness and time evolution of the optical transient associated withGW~170817 are broadly consistent with the predictions of models involvingmerging binary neutron stars. We infer from our data that the merging processejected about $\sim 10^{-2}$ solar mass of radioactive material at a speed ofup to $30\%$ the speed of light.

Optical Sky Brightness and Transparency During the Winter Season at Dome  A Antarctica From the Gattini-Allsky Camera

  The summit of the Antarctic plateau, Dome A, is proving to be an excellentsite for optical, NIR, and THz astronomical observations. GATTINI was awide-field camera installed on the PLATO instrument module as part of theChinese-led traverse to Dome A in January, 2009. We present here themeasurements of sky brightness with the Gattini ultra-large field of view (90deg x 90 deg) in the photometric B-, V-, and R-bands, cloud cover statisticsmeasured during the 2009 winter season, and an estimate of the skytransparency. A cumulative probability distribution indicates that the darkest10% of the nights at Dome A have sky brightness of S_B = 22.98, S_V = 21.86,and S_R = 21.68 mag arcsec^{-2}. These values were obtained around the year2009 with minimum aurora, and they are comparable to the faintest skybrightness at Mauna Kea and the best sites of northern Chile. Since everyfilter includes strong auroral lines that effectively contaminate the skybrightness measurements, for instruments working around the auroral lines,either with custom filters or with high spectral resolution instruments, thesevalues could be easily obtained on a more routine basis. In addition, wepresent example light curves for bright targets to emphasize the unprecedentedobservational window function available from this ground-based site. Theselight curves will be published in a future paper.

Exoplanets in the Antarctic sky. II. 116 Transiting Exoplanet Candidates  Found by AST3-II (CHESPA) within the Southern CVZ of TESS

  We report first results from the CHinese Exoplanet Searching Program fromAntarctica (CHESPA)---a wide-field high-resolution photometric survey fortransiting exoplanets carried out using telescopes of the AST3 (AntarcticSurvey Telescopes times 3) project. There are now three telescopes (AST3-I,AST3-II, and CSTAR-II) operating at Dome A---the highest point on the AntarcticPlateau---in a fully automatic and remote mode to exploit the superb observingconditions of the site, and its long and uninterrupted polar nights. The searchfor transiting exoplanets is one of the key projects for AST3. During theAustral winters of 2016 and 2017 we used the AST3-II telescope to survey a setof target fields near the southern ecliptic pole, falling within the continuousviewing zone of the TESS mission \citep{Ricker10}. The first data release ofthe 2016 data, including images, catalogs and lightcurves of 26578 bright stars($7.5\le i \le15$) was presented in \citet{Zhang18}. The best precision, asmeasured by the RMS of the lightcurves at the optimum magnitude of the survey($i=10$), is around 2\,mmag. We detect 222 objects with plausible transitsignals from these data, 116 of which are plausible transiting exoplanetcandidates according to their stellar properties as given by the TESS InputCatalog \citep{Stassun17}, Gaia DR2 \citep{Gaia18} and TESS-HERMES spectroscopy\citep{Sharma18}. With the first data release from TESS expected in late 2018,this candidate list will be a timely for improving the rejection of potentialfalse positives.

Exoplanets in the Antarctic Sky. I. The First Data Release of AST3-II  (CHESPA) and New Found Variables within the Southern CVZ of TESS

  Located at Dome A, the highest point of the Antarctic plateau, the ChineseKunlun station is considered to be one of the best ground-based photometricsites because of its extremely cold, dry, and stable atmosphere(Saunders et al.2009). A target can be monitored from there for over 40 days without diurnalinterruption during a polar winter. This makes Kunlun station a perfect site tosearch for short-period transiting exoplanets. Since 2008, an observatory hasbeen built at Kunlun station and three telescopes are working there. Usingthese telescopes, the AST3 project has been carried out over the last six yearswith a search for transiting exoplanets as one of its key programs (CHESPA). Inthe austral winters of 2016 and 2017, a set of target fields in the SouthernCVZ of TESS (Ricker et al. 2009) were monitored by the AST3-II telescope. Inthis paper, we introduce the CHESPA and present the first data releasecontaining photometry of 26,578 bright stars (m_i < 15). The best photometricprecision at the optimum magnitude for the survey is around 2 mmag. Todemonstrate the data quality, we also present a catalog of 221 variables with abrightness variation greater than 5 mmag from the 2016 data. Among thesevariables, 179 are newly identified periodic variables not listed in the AAVSOdatabasea), and 67 are listed in the Candidate Target List(Stassun et al.2017). These variables will require careful attention to avoid false-positivesignals when searching for transiting exoplanets. Dozens of new transitingexoplanet candidates will be also released in a subsequent paper(Zhang et al.2018b).

SCOPE: SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution -  Survey Description and Compact Source Catalogue

  We present the first release of the data and compact-source catalogue for theJCMT Large Program SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution(SCOPE). SCOPE consists of 850-um continuum observations of 1235 PlanckGalactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) made with the Submillimetre Common-User BolometerArray 2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data are at an angularresolution of 14.4 arcsec, significantly improving upon the 353-GHz resolutionof Planck at 5 arcmin, and allowing for a catalogue of 3528 compact sources in558 PGCCs. We find that the detected PGCCs have significant sub-structure, with61 per cent of detected PGCCs having 3 or more compact sources, withfilamentary structure also prevalent within the sample. A detection rate of 45per cent is found across the survey, which is 95 per cent complete to Planckcolumn densities of $N_{H_{2}}$ $>$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. Bypositionally associating the SCOPE compact sources with YSOs, the starformation efficiency, as measured by the ratio of luminosity to mass, in nearbyclouds is found to be similar to that in the more distant Galactic Plane, withthe column density distributions also indistinguishable from each other.
