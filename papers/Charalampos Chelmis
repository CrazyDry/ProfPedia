Not all Embeddings are created Equal: Extracting Entity-specific  Substructures for RDF Graph Embedding

  Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are becoming essential to information systems thatrequire access to structured data. Several approaches have been recentlyproposed, for obtaining vector representations of KGs suitable for MachineLearning tasks, based on identifying and extracting relevant graphsubstructures using uniform and biased random walks. However, such approacheslead to representations comprising mostly "popular", instead of "relevant",entities in the KG. In KGs, in which different types of entities often exist(such as in Linked Open Data), a given target entity may have its own distinctset of most "relevant" nodes and edges. We propose specificity as an accuratemeasure of identifying most relevant, entity-specific, nodes and edges. Wedevelop a scalable method based on bidirectional random walks to computespecificity. Our experimental evaluation results show that specificity-basedbiased random walks extract more "meaningful" (in terms of size and relevance)RDF substructures compared to the state-of-the-art and, the graph embeddinglearned from the extracted substructures, outperform existing techniques in thetask of entity recommendation in DBpedia.
