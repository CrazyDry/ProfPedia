A Risk Comparison of Ordinary Least Squares vs Ridge Regression

  We compare the risk of ridge regression to a simple variant of ordinary leastsquares, in which one simply projects the data onto a finite dimensionalsubspace (as specified by a Principal Component Analysis) and then performs anordinary (un-regularized) least squares regression in this subspace. This noteshows that the risk of this ordinary least squares method is within a constantfactor (namely 4) of the risk of ridge regression.

The Remarkable Benefit of User-Level Aggregation for Lexical-based  Population-Level Predictions

  Nowcasting based on social media text promises to provide unobtrusive andnear real-time predictions of community-level outcomes. These outcomes aretypically regarding people, but the data is often aggregated without regard tousers in the Twitter populations of each community. This paper describes asimple yet effective method for building community-level models using Twitterlanguage aggregated by user. Results on four different U.S. county-level tasks,spanning demographic, health, and psychological outcomes show large andconsistent improvements in prediction accuracies (e.g. from Pearson r=.73 to.82 for median income prediction or r=.37 to .47 for life satisfactionprediction) over the standard approach of aggregating all tweets. We make ouraggregated and anonymized community-level data, derived from 37 billion tweets-- over 1 billion of which were mapped to counties, available for research.

Spectral dimensionality reduction for HMMs

  Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be accurately approximated usingco-occurrence frequencies of pairs and triples of observations by using a fastspectral method in contrast to the usual slow methods like EM or Gibbssampling. We provide a new spectral method which significantly reduces thenumber of model parameters that need to be estimated, and generates a samplecomplexity that does not depend on the size of the observation vocabulary. Wepresent an elementary proof giving bounds on the relative accuracy ofprobability estimates from our model. (Correlaries show our bounds can beweakened to provide either L1 bounds or KL bounds which provide easier directcomparisons to previous work.) Our theorem uses conditions that are checkablefrom the data, instead of putting conditions on the unobservable Markovtransition matrix.

Probabilistic Models for Unified Collaborative and Content-Based  Recommendation in Sparse-Data Environments

  Recommender systems leverage product and community information to targetproducts to consumers. Researchers have developed collaborative recommenders,content-based recommenders, and (largely ad-hoc) hybrid systems. We propose aunified probabilistic framework for merging collaborative and content-basedrecommendations. We extend Hofmann's [1999] aspect model to incorporatethree-way co-occurrence data among users, items, and item content. The relativeinfluence of collaboration data versus content data is not imposed as anexogenous parameter, but rather emerges naturally from the given data sources.Global probabilistic models coupled with standard Expectation Maximization (EM)learning algorithms tend to drastically overfit in sparse-data situations, asis typical in recommendation applications. We show that secondary contentinformation can often be used to overcome sparsity. Experiments on data fromthe ResearchIndex library of Computer Science publications show thatappropriate mixture models incorporating secondary data produce significantlybetter quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Globalprobabilistic models also allow more general inferences than local methods likek-NN.

Modeling Probability Forecasts via Information Diversity

  Randomness in scientific estimation is generally assumed to arise fromunmeasured or uncontrolled factors. However, when combining subjectiveprobability estimates, heterogeneity stemming from people's cognitive orinformation diversity is often more important than measurement noise. Thispaper presents a novel framework that models the heterogeneity arising fromexperts that use partially overlapping information sources, and applies thatmodel to the task of aggregating the probabilities given by a group of expertswho forecast whether an event will occur or not. Our model describes thedistribution of information across experts in terms of easily interpretableparameters and shows how the optimal amount of extremizing of the averageprobability forecast (shifting it closer to its nearest extreme) varies as afunction of the experts' information overlap. Our model thus gives a moreprincipled understanding of the historically ad hoc practice of extremizingaverage forecasts.

Probability aggregation in time-series: Dynamic hierarchical modeling of  sparse expert beliefs

  Most subjective probability aggregation procedures use a single probabilityjudgment from each expert, even though it is common for experts studying realproblems to update their probability estimates over time. This paper advancesinto unexplored areas of probability aggregation by considering a dynamiccontext in which experts can update their beliefs at random intervals. Theupdates occur very infrequently, resulting in a sparse data set that cannot bemodeled by standard time-series procedures. In response to the lack ofappropriate methodology, this paper presents a hierarchical model that takesinto account the expert's level of self-reported expertise and producesaggregate probabilities that are sharp and well calibrated both in- andout-of-sample. The model is demonstrated on a real-world data set that includesover 2300 experts making multiple probability forecasts over two years ondifferent subsets of 166 international political events.

Partial Information Framework: Model-Based Aggregation of Estimates from  Diverse Information Sources

  Prediction polling is an increasingly popular form of crowdsourcing in whichmultiple participants estimate the probability or magnitude of some futureevent. These estimates are then aggregated into a single forecast.Historically, randomness in scientific estimation has been generally assumed toarise from unmeasured factors which are viewed as measurement noise. However,when combining subjective estimates, heterogeneity stemming from differences inthe participants' information is often more important than measurement noise.This paper formalizes information diversity as an alternative source of suchheterogeneity and introduces a novel modeling framework that is particularlywell-suited for prediction polls. A practical specification of this frameworkis proposed and applied to the task of aggregating probability and pointestimates from two real-world prediction polls. In both cases our modeloutperforms standard measurement-error-based aggregators, hence providingevidence in favor of information diversity being the more important source ofheterogeneity.

A Risk Ratio Comparison of $l_0$ and $l_1$ Penalized Regression

  There has been an explosion of interest in using $l_1$-regularization inplace of $l_0$-regularization for feature selection. We present theoreticalresults showing that while $l_1$-penalized linear regression never outperforms$l_0$-regularization by more than a constant factor, in some cases using an$l_1$ penalty is infinitely worse than using an $l_0$ penalty. We also showthat the "optimal" $l_1$ solutions are often inferior to $l_0$ solutions foundusing stepwise regression.  We also compare algorithms for solving these two problems and show thatalthough solutions can be found efficiently for the $l_1$ problem, the"optimal" $l_1$ solutions are often inferior to $l_0$ solutions found usinggreedy classic stepwise regression. Furthermore, we show that solutionsobtained by solving the convex $l_1$ problem can be improved by selecting thebest of the $l_1$ models (for different regularization penalties) by using an$l_0$ criterion. In other words, an approximate solution to the right problemcan be better than the exact solution to the wrong problem.

Latent Human Traits in the Language of Social Media: An Open-Vocabulary  Approach

  Over the past century, personality theory and research has successfullyidentified core sets of characteristics that consistently describe and explainfundamental differences in the way people think, feel and behave. Suchcharacteristics were derived through theory, dictionary analyses, and surveyresearch using explicit self-reports. The availability of social media dataspanning millions of users now makes it possible to automatically derivecharacteristics from language use -- at large scale. Taking advantage oflinguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process ofinferring a new set of potential human traits based on unprompted language use.We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and comparethem with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that ourlanguage-based trait construct is often more generalizable in that it oftenpredicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-basedtraits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), whilethe factors remain nearly as stable as traditional factors. Our approachsuggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from everyday humanlanguage use.

Tree-Structured Boosting: Connections Between Gradient Boosted Stumps  and Full Decision Trees

  Additive models, such as produced by gradient boosting, and full interactionmodels, such as classification and regression trees (CART), are widely usedalgorithms that have been investigated largely in isolation. We show that thesemodels exist along a spectrum, revealing never-before-known connections betweenthese two approaches. This paper introduces a novel technique calledtree-structured boosting for creating a single decision tree, and shows thatthis method can produce models equivalent to CART or gradient boosted stumps atthe extremes by varying a single parameter. Although tree-structured boostingis designed primarily to provide both the model interpretability and predictiveperformance needed for high-stake applications like medicine, it also canproduce decision trees represented by hybrid models between CART and boostedstumps that can outperform either of these approaches.

Learning Neural Emotion Analysis from 100 Observations: The Surprising  Effectiveness of Pre-Trained Word Representations

  Deep Learning has drastically reshaped virtually all areas of NLP. Yet on thedownside, it is commonly thought to be dependent on vast amounts of trainingdata. As such, these techniques appear ill-suited for areas where annotateddata is limited, like emotion analysis, with its many nuanced andhard-to-acquire annotation formats, or other low-data scenarios encountered inunder-resourced languages. In contrast to this popular notion, we provideempirical evidence from three typologically diverse languages that today'sfavorite neural architectures can be trained on a few hundred observationsonly. Our results suggest that high-quality, pre-trained word embeddings arecrucial for achieving high performance despite such strong data limitations.

Studying Cultural Differences in Emoji Usage across the East and the  West

  Global acceptance of Emojis suggests a cross-cultural, normative use ofEmojis. Meanwhile, nuances in Emoji use across cultures may also exist due tolinguistic differences in expressing emotions and diversity in conceptualizingtopics. Indeed, literature in cross-cultural psychology has found bothnormative and culture-specific ways in which emotions are expressed. In thispaper, using social media, we compare the Emoji usage based on frequency,context, and topic associations across countries in the East (China and Japan)and the West (United States, United Kingdom, and Canada). Across the East andthe West, our study examines a) similarities and differences on the usage ofdifferent categories of Emojis such as People, Food \& Drink, Travel \& Placesetc., b) potential mapping of Emoji use differences with previously identifiedcultural differences in users' expression about diverse concepts such as death,money emotions and family, and c) relative correspondence of validatedpsycho-linguistic categories with Ekman's emotions. The analysis of Emoji usein the East and the West reveals recognizable normative and culture specificpatterns. This research reveals the ways in which Emojis can be used forcross-cultural communication.

What Twitter Profile and Posted Images Reveal About Depression and  Anxiety

  Previous work has found strong links between the choice of social mediaimages and users' emotions, demographics and personality traits. In this study,we examine which attributes of profile and posted images are associated withdepression and anxiety of Twitter users. We used a sample of 28,749 Facebookusers to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression andanxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had takenanxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132Twitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, andextracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover theassociations with users' depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics.For depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions ratherthan display more negative emotions, likely because of social mediaself-presentation biases. They also tend to show the single face of the user(rather than show her in groups of friends), marking increased focus on theself, emblematic for depression. Posted images are dominated by grayscale andlow aesthetic cohesion across a variety of image features. Profile images ofanxious users are similarly marked by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion, butless so than those of depressed users. Finally, we show that image features canbe used to predict depression and anxiety, and that multitask learning thatincludes a joint modeling of demographics improves prediction performance.Overall, we find that the image attributes that mark depression and anxietyoffer a rich lens into these conditions largely congruent with thepsychological literature, and that images on Twitter allow inferences about themental health status of users.
