Programming by Demonstration with User-Specified Perceptual Landmarks

  Programming by demonstration (PbD) is an effective technique for developingcomplex robot manipulation tasks, such as opening bottles or using human tools.In order for such tasks to generalize to new scenes, the robot needs to be ableto perceive objects, object parts, or other task-relevant parts of the scene.Previous work has relied on rigid, task-specific perception systems for thispurpose. This paper presents a flexible and open-ended perception system thatlets users specify perceptual "landmarks" during the demonstration, bycapturing parts of the point cloud from the demonstration scene. We present amethod for localizing landmarks in new scenes and experimentally evaluate thismethod in a variety of settings. Then, we provide examples where user-specifiedlandmarks are used together with PbD on a PR2 robot to perform several complexmanipulation tasks. Finally, we present findings from a user evaluation of ourlandmark specification interface demonstrating its feasibility as an end-usertool.
