FWDA: a Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis with its Application to  Electronic Health Records Data Classification

  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data iswidely-used for early detection of diseases. Classical LDA for EHR dataclassification, however, suffers from two handicaps: the ill-posed estimationof LDA parameters (e.g., covariance matrix), and the "linear inseparability" ofEHR data. To handle these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novelclassifier FWDA -- Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, that makes predictionsin an ensemble way. Specifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution ofinverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from thetraining data, then "weighted-averages" the classification results of multipleLDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via aBayesian Voting scheme. The weights for voting are optimally updated to adapteach new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoreticalanalysis indicates that FWDA possesses a fast convergence rate and a robustperformance on high dimensional data. Extensive experiments on large-scale EHRdataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by alarge margin.

An Improved Speedup Factor for Sporadic Tasks with Constrained Deadlines  under Dynamic Priority Scheduling

  Schedulability is a fundamental problem in real-time scheduling, but it hasto be approximated due to the intrinsic computational hardness. As the mostpopular algorithm for deciding schedulability on multiprocess platforms, thespeedup factor of partitioned-EDF is challenging to analyze and is far frombeen determined. Partitioned-EDF was first proposed in 2005 by Barush andFisher [1], and was shown to have a speedup factor at most 3-1/m, meaning thatif the input of sporadic tasks is feasible on m processors with speed one,partitioned-EDF will always return succeeded on m processors with speed 3-1/m.In 2011, this upper bound was improved to 2.6322-1/m by Chen and Chakraborty[2], and no more improvements have appeared ever since then. In this paper, wedevelop a novel method to discretize and regularize sporadic tasks, whichenables us to improve, in the case of constrained deadlines, the speedup factorof partitioned-EDF to 2.5556-1/m, very close to the asymptotic lower bound 2.5in [2].

DRESS: Dynamic RESource-reservation Scheme for Congested Data-intensive  Computing Platforms

  In the past few years, we have envisioned an increasing number of businessesstart driving by big data analytics, such as Amazon recommendations and GoogleAdvertisements. At the back-end side, the businesses are powered by big dataprocessing platforms to quickly extract information and make decisions. Runningon top of a computing cluster, those platforms utilize scheduling algorithms toallocate resources. An efficient scheduler is crucial to the system performancedue to limited resources, e.g. CPU and Memory, and a large number of userdemands. However, besides requests from clients and current status of thesystem, it has limited knowledge about execution length of the running jobs,and incoming jobs' resource demands, which make assigning resources achallenging task. If most of the resources are occupied by a long-running job,other jobs will have to keep waiting until it releases them. This paperpresents a new scheduling strategy, named DRESS that particularly aims tooptimize the allocation among jobs with various demands. Specifically, itclassifies the jobs into two categories based on their requests, reserves aportion of resources for each of category, and dynamically adjusts the reservedratio by monitoring the pending requests and estimating release patterns ofrunning jobs. The results demonstrate DRESS significantly reduces thecompletion time for one category, up to 76.1% in our experiments, and in themeanwhile, maintains a stable overall system performance.
