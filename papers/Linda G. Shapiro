Head Reconstruction from Internet Photos

  3D face reconstruction from Internet photos has recently produced excitingresults. A person's face, e.g., Tom Hanks, can be modeled and animated in 3Dfrom a completely uncalibrated photo collection. Most methods, however, focussolely on face area and mask out the rest of the head. This paper proposes thathead modeling from the Internet is a problem we can solve. We targetreconstruction of the rough shape of the head. Our method is to gradually"grow" the head mesh starting from the frontal face and extending to the restof views using photometric stereo constraints. We call our methodboundary-value growing algorithm. Results on photos of celebrities downloadedfrom the Internet are presented.

Y-Net: Joint Segmentation and Classification for Diagnosis of Breast  Biopsy Images

  In this paper, we introduce a conceptually simple network for generatingdiscriminative tissue-level segmentation masks for the purpose of breast cancerdiagnosis. Our method efficiently segments different types of tissues in breastbiopsy images while simultaneously predicting a discriminative map foridentifying important areas in an image. Our network, Y-Net, extends andgeneralizes U-Net by adding a parallel branch for discriminative map generationand by supporting convolutional block modularity, which allows the user toadjust network efficiency without altering the network topology. Y-Net deliversstate-of-the-art segmentation accuracy while learning 6.6x fewer parametersthan its closest competitors. The addition of descriptive power from Y-Net'sdiscriminative segmentation masks improve diagnostic classification accuracy by7% over state-of-the-art methods for diagnostic classification.

3D Face Hallucination from a Single Depth Frame

  We present an algorithm that takes a single frame of a person's face from adepth camera, e.g., Kinect, and produces a high-resolution 3D mesh of the inputface. We leverage a dataset of 3D face meshes of 1204 distinct individualsranging from age 3 to 40, captured in a neutral expression. We divide the inputdepth frame into semantically significant regions (eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks)and search the database for the best matching shape per region. We furthercombine the input depth frame with the matched database shapes into a singlemesh that results in a high-resolution shape of the input person. Our system isfully automatic and uses only depth data for matching, making it invariant toimaging conditions. We evaluate our results using ground truth shapes, as wellas compare to state-of-the-art shape estimation methods. We demonstrate therobustness of our local matching approach with high-quality reconstruction offaces that fall outside of the dataset span, e.g., faces older than 40 yearsold, facial expressions, and different ethnicities.

Video to Fully Automatic 3D Hair Model

  Imagine taking a selfie video with your mobile phone and getting as output a3D model of your head (face and 3D hair strands) that can be later used in VR,AR, and any other domain. State of the art hair reconstruction methods alloweither a single photo (thus compromising 3D quality) or multiple views, butthey require manual user interaction (manual hair segmentation and capture offixed camera views that span full 360 degree). In this paper, we describe asystem that can completely automatically create a reconstruction from any video(even a selfie video), and we don't require specific views, since taking your-90 degree, 90 degree, and full back views is not feasible in a selfie capture.  In the core of our system, in addition to the automatization components, hairstrands are estimated and deformed in 3D (rather than 2D as in state of theart) thus enabling superior results. We provide qualitative, quantitative, andMechanical Turk human studies that support the proposed system, and showresults on a diverse variety of videos (8 different celebrity videos, 9 selfiemobile videos, spanning age, gender, hair length, type, and styling).

The SINS/zC-SINF survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for  gravitational quenching

  As part of the SINS/zC-SINF surveys of high-z galaxy kinematics, we derivethe radial distributions of H-alpha surface brightness, stellar mass surfacedensity, and dynamical mass at ~2 kpc resolution in 19 z~2 star-forming diskswith deep SINFONI AO spectroscopy at the ESO VLT. From these data we infer theradial distribution of the Toomre Q-parameter for these main-sequence starforming galaxies (SFGs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (10^9.6 to10^11.5 solar masses). In more than half of our SFGs, the H-alpha distributionscannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, butare better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and anexponential. At the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of amass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponentialdistribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. The resulting Q-distributions arecentrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for threequarters of the SFGs. The occurrence of H-alpha rings and of large nuclearQ-values is strongly correlated, and is more common for the more massive SFGs.While our sample is small and there remain substantial uncertainties andcaveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloudfragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas richhigh-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of thedisks grows.

Training the Next Generation of Astronomers

  While both society and astronomy have evolved greatly over the past fiftyyears, the academic institutions and incentives that shape our field haveremained largely stagnant. As a result, the astronomical community is facedwith several major challenges, including: (1) the training that we provide doesnot align with the skills that future astronomers will need, (2) thepostdoctoral phase is becoming increasingly demanding and demoralizing, and (3)our jobs are increasingly unfriendly to families with children. Solving theseproblems will require conscious engineering of our profession. Fortunately,this Decadal Review offers the opportunity to revise outmoded practices to bemore effective and equitable. The highest priority of the Subcommittee on theState of the Profession should be to recommend specific, funded activities thatwill ensure the field meets the challenges we describe.
