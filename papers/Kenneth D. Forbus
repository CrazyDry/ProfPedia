Neural Symbolic Machines: Learning Semantic Parsers on Freebase with
  Weak Supervision

  Harnessing the statistical power of neural networks to perform language
understanding and symbolic reasoning is difficult, when it requires executing
efficient discrete operations against a large knowledge-base. In this work, we
introduce a Neural Symbolic Machine, which contains (a) a neural "programmer",
i.e., a sequence-to-sequence model that maps language utterances to programs
and utilizes a key-variable memory to handle compositionality (b) a symbolic
"computer", i.e., a Lisp interpreter that performs program execution, and helps
find good programs by pruning the search space. We apply REINFORCE to directly
optimize the task reward of this structured prediction problem. To train with
weak supervision and improve the stability of REINFORCE, we augment it with an
iterative maximum-likelihood training process. NSM outperforms the
state-of-the-art on the WebQuestionsSP dataset when trained from
question-answer pairs only, without requiring any feature engineering or
domain-specific knowledge.


Neural Symbolic Machines: Learning Semantic Parsers on Freebase with
  Weak Supervision (Short Version)

  Extending the success of deep neural networks to natural language
understanding and symbolic reasoning requires complex operations and external
memory. Recent neural program induction approaches have attempted to address
this problem, but are typically limited to differentiable memory, and
consequently cannot scale beyond small synthetic tasks. In this work, we
propose the Manager-Programmer-Computer framework, which integrates neural
networks with non-differentiable memory to support abstract, scalable and
precise operations through a friendly neural computer interface. Specifically,
we introduce a Neural Symbolic Machine, which contains a sequence-to-sequence
neural "programmer", and a non-differentiable "computer" that is a Lisp
interpreter with code assist. To successfully apply REINFORCE for training, we
augment it with approximate gold programs found by an iterative maximum
likelihood training process. NSM is able to learn a semantic parser from weak
supervision over a large knowledge base. It achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on WebQuestionsSP, a challenging semantic parsing dataset, with
weak supervision. Compared to previous approaches, NSM is end-to-end, therefore
does not rely on feature engineering or domain specific knowledge.
