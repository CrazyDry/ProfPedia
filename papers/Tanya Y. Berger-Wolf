Index Assignment for Multichannel Communication under Failure

  We consider the problem of multiple description scalar quantizers anddescribing the achievable rate-distortion tuples in that setting. We formulateit as a combinatorial optimization problem of arranging numbers in a matrix tominimize the maximum difference between the largest and the smallest number inany row or column. We develop a technique for deriving lower bounds on thedistortion at given channel rates. The approach is constructive, thus allowingan algorithm that gives a closely matching upper bound. For the case of twocommunication channels with equal rates, the bounds coincide, thus giving theprecise lowest achievable distortion at fixed rates. The bounds are within asmall constant for higher number of channels. To the best of our knowledge,this is the first result concerning systems with more than two communicationchannels. The problem is also equivalent to the bandwidth minimization problemof Hamming graphs.

Sharp Bounds for Bandwidth of Clique Products

  The bandwidth of a graph is the labeling of vertices with minimum maximumedge difference. For many graph families this is NP-complete. A classic resultcomputes the bandwidth for the hypercube. We generalize this result to givesharp lower bounds for products of cliques. This problem turns out to beequivalent to one in communication over multiple channels in which channels canfail and the information sent over those channels is lost. The goal is tocreate an encoding that minimizes the difference between the received and theoriginal information while having as little redundancy as possible. Berger-Wolfand Reingold [2] have considered the problem for the equal size cliques (orequal capacity channels). This paper presents a tight lower bound and analgorithm for constructing the labeling for the product of any number ofarbitrary size cliques.

Wildbook: Crowdsourcing, computer vision, and data science for  conservation

  Photographs, taken by field scientists, tourists, automated cameras, andincidental photographers, are the most abundant source of data on wildlifetoday. Wildbook is an autonomous computational system that starts from massivecollections of images and, by detecting various species of animals andidentifying individuals, combined with sophisticated data management, turnsthem into high resolution information database, enabling scientific inquiry,conservation, and citizen science.  We have built Wildbooks for whales (flukebook.org), sharks (whaleshark.org),two species of zebras (Grevy's and plains), and several others. In January2016, Wildbook enabled the first ever full species (the endangered Grevy'szebra) census using photographs taken by ordinary citizens in Kenya. Theresulting numbers are now the official species census used by IUCN Red List:http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7950/0. In 2016, Wildbook partnered up withWWF to build Wildbook for Sea Turtles, Internet of Turtles (IoT), as well assystems for seals and lynx. Most recently, we have demonstrated that we can nowuse publicly available social media images to count and track wild animals.  In this paper we present and discuss both the impact and challenges that theuse of crowdsourced images can have on wildlife conservation.
