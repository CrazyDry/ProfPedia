Index Assignment for Multichannel Communication under Failure

  We consider the problem of multiple description scalar quantizers and
describing the achievable rate-distortion tuples in that setting. We formulate
it as a combinatorial optimization problem of arranging numbers in a matrix to
minimize the maximum difference between the largest and the smallest number in
any row or column. We develop a technique for deriving lower bounds on the
distortion at given channel rates. The approach is constructive, thus allowing
an algorithm that gives a closely matching upper bound. For the case of two
communication channels with equal rates, the bounds coincide, thus giving the
precise lowest achievable distortion at fixed rates. The bounds are within a
small constant for higher number of channels. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first result concerning systems with more than two communication
channels. The problem is also equivalent to the bandwidth minimization problem
of Hamming graphs.


Sharp Bounds for Bandwidth of Clique Products

  The bandwidth of a graph is the labeling of vertices with minimum maximum
edge difference. For many graph families this is NP-complete. A classic result
computes the bandwidth for the hypercube. We generalize this result to give
sharp lower bounds for products of cliques. This problem turns out to be
equivalent to one in communication over multiple channels in which channels can
fail and the information sent over those channels is lost. The goal is to
create an encoding that minimizes the difference between the received and the
original information while having as little redundancy as possible. Berger-Wolf
and Reingold [2] have considered the problem for the equal size cliques (or
equal capacity channels). This paper presents a tight lower bound and an
algorithm for constructing the labeling for the product of any number of
arbitrary size cliques.


Wildbook: Crowdsourcing, computer vision, and data science for
  conservation

  Photographs, taken by field scientists, tourists, automated cameras, and
incidental photographers, are the most abundant source of data on wildlife
today. Wildbook is an autonomous computational system that starts from massive
collections of images and, by detecting various species of animals and
identifying individuals, combined with sophisticated data management, turns
them into high resolution information database, enabling scientific inquiry,
conservation, and citizen science.
  We have built Wildbooks for whales (flukebook.org), sharks (whaleshark.org),
two species of zebras (Grevy's and plains), and several others. In January
2016, Wildbook enabled the first ever full species (the endangered Grevy's
zebra) census using photographs taken by ordinary citizens in Kenya. The
resulting numbers are now the official species census used by IUCN Red List:
http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7950/0. In 2016, Wildbook partnered up with
WWF to build Wildbook for Sea Turtles, Internet of Turtles (IoT), as well as
systems for seals and lynx. Most recently, we have demonstrated that we can now
use publicly available social media images to count and track wild animals.
  In this paper we present and discuss both the impact and challenges that the
use of crowdsourced images can have on wildlife conservation.
