Robust Shape Registration using Fuzzy Correspondences

  Shape registration is the process of aligning one 3D model to another. Mostprevious methods to align shapes with no known correspondences attempt to solvefor both the transformation and correspondences iteratively. We present a shaperegistration approach that solves for the transformation using fuzzycorrespondences to maximize the overlap between the given shape and the targetshape. A coarse to fine approach with Levenberg-Marquardt method is used foroptimization. Real and synthetic experiments show our approach is robust andoutperforms other state of the art methods when point clouds are noisy, sparse,and have non-uniform density. Experiments show our method is more robust toinitialization and can handle larger scale changes and rotation than othermethods. We also show that the approach can be used for 2D-3D alignment viaray-point alignment.

Learning Dense Stereo Matching for Digital Surface Models from Satellite  Imagery

  Digital Surface Model generation from satellite imagery is a difficult taskthat has been largely overlooked by the deep learning community. Stereoreconstruction techniques developed for terrestrial systems including selfdriving cars do not translate well to satellite imagery where image pairs varyconsiderably. In this work we present neural network tailored for DigitalSurface Model generation, a ground truthing and training scheme which maximizesavailable hardware, and we present a comparison to existing methods. Theresulting models are smooth, preserve boundaries, and enable furtherprocessing. This represents one of the first attempts at leveraging deeplearning in this domain.
