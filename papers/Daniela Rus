Two Distinct Phases of Bilayer Graphene Films on Ru(0001)

  By combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelingmicroscopy we reveal the structural and electronic properties of multilayergraphene on Ru(0001). We prove that large ethylene exposure allows tosynthesize two distinct phases of bilayer graphene with different properties.The first phase has Bernal AB stacking with respect to the first graphenelayer, displays weak vertical interaction and electron doping. The long-rangeordered moir\'e pattern modulates the crystal potential and induces replicas ofthe Dirac cone and minigaps. The second phase has AA stacking sequence withrespect to the first layer, displays weak structural and electronic modulationand p-doping. The linearly dispersing Dirac state reveals thenearly-freestanding character of this novel second layer phase.

Road Pricing for Spreading Peak Travel: Modeling and Design

  A case study of the Singapore road network provides empirical evidence thatroad pricing can significantly affect commuter trip timing behaviors. In thispaper, we propose a model of trip timing decisions that reasonably matches theobserved commuters' behaviors. Our model explicitly captures the difference inindividuals' sensitivity to price, travel time and early or late arrival atdestination. New pricing schemes are suggested to better spread peak travel andreduce traffic congestion. Simulation results based on the proposed model areprovided in comparison with the real data for the Singapore case study.

MDP Optimal Control under Temporal Logic Constraints

  In this paper, we develop a method to automatically generate a control policyfor a dynamical system modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The controlspecification is given as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a set ofpropositions defined on the states of the MDP. We synthesize a control policysuch that the MDP satisfies the given specification almost surely, if such apolicy exists. In addition, we designate an "optimizing proposition" to berepeatedly satisfied, and we formulate a novel optimization criterion in termsof minimizing the expected cost in between satisfactions of this proposition.We propose a sufficient condition for a policy to be optimal, and develop adynamic programming algorithm that synthesizes a policy that is optimal undersome conditions, and sub-optimal otherwise. This problem is motivated byrobotic applications requiring persistent tasks, such as environmentalmonitoring or data gathering, to be performed.

LTL Control in Uncertain Environments with Probabilistic Satisfaction  Guarantees

  We present a method to generate a robot control strategy that maximizes theprobability to accomplish a task. The task is given as a Linear Temporal Logic(LTL) formula over a set of properties that can be satisfied at the regions ofa partitioned environment. We assume that the probabilities with which theproperties are satisfied at the regions are known, and the robot can determinethe truth value of a proposition only at the current region. Motivated byseveral results on partitioned-based abstractions, we assume that the motion isperformed on a graph. To account for noisy sensors and actuators, we assumethat a control action enables several transitions with known probabilities. Weshow that this problem can be reduced to the problem of generating a controlpolicy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) such that the probability ofsatisfying an LTL formula over its states is maximized. We provide a completesolution for the latter problem that builds on existing results fromprobabilistic model checking. We include an illustrative case study.

Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning with Temporal Logic Constraints

  In this paper we present a method for automatically planning optimal pathsfor a group of robots that satisfy a common high level mission specification.Each robot's motion in the environment is modeled as a weighted transitionsystem. The mission is given as a Linear Temporal Logic formula. In addition,an optimizing proposition must repeatedly be satisfied. The goal is to minimizethe maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition.Our method is guaranteed to compute an optimal set of robot paths. We utilize atimed automaton representation in order to capture the relative position of therobots in the environment. We then obtain a bisimulation of this timedautomaton as a finite transition system that captures the joint behavior of therobots and apply our earlier algorithm for the single robot case to optimizethe group motion. We present a simulation of a persistent monitoring task in aroad network environment.

Incremental Temporal Logic Synthesis of Control Policies for Robots  Interacting with Dynamic Agents

  We consider the synthesis of control policies from temporal logicspecifications for robots that interact with multiple dynamic environmentagents. Each environment agent is modeled by a Markov chain whereas the robotis modeled by a finite transition system (in the deterministic case) or Markovdecision process (in the stochastic case). Existing results in probabilisticverification are adapted to solve the synthesis problem. To partially addressthe state explosion issue, we propose an incremental approach where only asmall subset of environment agents is incorporated in the synthesis procedureinitially and more agents are successively added until we hit the constraintson computational resources. Our algorithm runs in an anytime fashion where theprobability that the robot satisfies its specification increases as thealgorithm progresses.

Pebble Motion on Graphs with Rotations: Efficient Feasibility Tests and  Planning Algorithms

  We study the problem of planning paths for $p$ distinguishable pebbles(robots) residing on the vertices of an $n$-vertex connected graph with $p \len$. A pebble may move from a vertex to an adjacent one in a time step providedthat it does not collide with other pebbles. When $p = n$, the only collisionfree moves are synchronous rotations of pebbles on disjoint cycles of thegraph. We show that the feasibility of such problems is intrinsicallydetermined by the diameter of a (unique) permutation group induced by theunderlying graph. Roughly speaking, the diameter of a group $\mathbf G$ is theminimum length of the generator product required to reach an arbitrary elementof $\mathbf G$ from the identity element. Through bounding the diameter of thisassociated permutation group, which assumes a maximum value of $O(n^2)$, weestablish a linear time algorithm for deciding the feasibility of such problemsand an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for planning complete paths.

A GPS Pseudorange Based Cooperative Vehicular Distance Measurement  Technique

  Accurate vehicular localization is important for various cooperative vehiclesafety (CVS) applications such as collision avoidance, turning assistant, etc.In this paper, we propose a cooperative vehicular distance measurementtechnique based on the sharing of GPS pseudorange measurements and a weightedleast squares method. The classic double difference pseudorange solution, whichwas originally designed for high-end survey level GPS systems, is adapted tolow-end navigation level GPS receivers for its wide availability in groundvehicles. The Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNR) of raw pseudorange measurements aretaken into account for noise mitigation. We present a Dedicated Short RangeCommunications (DSRC) based mechanism to implement the exchange of pseudorangeinformation among neighboring vehicles. As demonstrated in field tests, ourproposed technique increases the accuracy of the distance measurementsignificantly compared with the distance obtained from the GPS fixes.

Minimum-violation LTL Planning with Conflicting Specifications

  We consider the problem of automatic generation of control strategies forrobotic vehicles given a set of high-level mission specifications, such as"Vehicle x must eventually visit a target region and then return to a base,""Regions A and B must be periodically surveyed," or "None of the vehicles canenter an unsafe region." We focus on instances when all of the givenspecifications cannot be reached simultaneously due to their incompatibilityand/or environmental constraints. We aim to find the least-violating controlstrategy while considering different priorities of satisfying different partsof the mission. Formally, we consider the missions given in the form of lineartemporal logic formulas, each of which is assigned a reward that is earned whenthe formula is satisfied. Leveraging ideas from the automata-based modelchecking, we propose an algorithm for finding an optimal control strategy thatmaximizes the sum of rewards earned if this control strategy is applied. Wedemonstrate the proposed algorithm on an illustrative case study.

Correlated Orienteering Problem and it Application to Persistent  Monitoring Tasks

  We propose a novel non-linear extension to the Orienteering Problem (OP),called the Correlated Orienteering Problem (COP). We use COP to model theplanning of informative tours for the persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporalfield with time-invariant spatial correlations, in which the tours areconstrained to have limited length. Our focus in this paper is QCOP a quadraticCOP formulation that only looks at correlations between neighboring nodes in anode network. The main feature of QCOP is a quadratic utility functioncapturing the said spatial correlation. QCOP may be solved using mixed integerquadratic programming (MIQP), with the resulting anytime algorithm capable ofplanning multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility. Inparticular, our algorithm can quickly plan a near-optimal tour over a networkwith up to $150$ nodes. Besides performing extensive simulation studies toverify the algorithm's correctness and characterize its performance, we alsosuccessfully applied it to two realistic persistent monitoring tasks: (i)estimation over a synthetic spatiotemporal field, and (ii) estimating thetemperature distribution in the state of Massachusetts.

Optimal Tourist Problem and Anytime Planning of Trip Itineraries

  We introduce and study the problem in which a mobile sensing robot (ourtourist) is tasked to travel among and gather intelligence at a set ofspatially distributed point-of-interests (POIs). The quality of the informationcollected at each POI is characterized by some non-decreasing reward functionover the time spent at the POI. With limited time budget, the robot mustbalance between spending time traveling to POIs and spending time at POIs forinformation collection (sensing) so as to maximize the total reward.Alternatively, the robot may be required to acquire a minimum mount of rewardand hopes to do so with the least amount of time. We propose a mixed integerprogramming (MIP) based anytime algorithm for solving these two NP-hardoptimization problems to arbitrary precision. The effectiveness of ouralgorithm is demonstrated using an extensive set of computational experimentsincluding the planning of a realistic itinerary for a first-time tourist inIstanbul.

In-Network Distributed Solar Current Prediction

  Long-term sensor network deployments demand careful power management. Whilemanaging power requires understanding the amount of energy harvestable from thelocal environment, current solar prediction methods rely only on recent localhistory, which makes them susceptible to high variability. In this paper, wepresent a model and algorithms for distributed solar current prediction, basedon multiple linear regression to predict future solar current based on local,in-situ climatic and solar measurements. These algorithms leverage spatialinformation from neighbors and adapt to the changing local conditions notcaptured by global climatic information. We implement these algorithms on ourFleck platform and run a 7-week-long experiment validating our work. Inanalyzing our results from this experiment, we determined that computing ourmodel requires an increased energy expenditure of 4.5mJ over simpler models (onthe order of 10^{-7}% of the harvested energy) to gain a prediction improvementof 39.7%.

Dimensionality Reduction of Massive Sparse Datasets Using Coresets

  In this paper we present a practical solution with performance guarantees tothe problem of dimensionality reduction for very large scale sparse matrices.We show applications of our approach to computing the low rank approximation(reduced SVD) of such matrices. Our solution uses coresets, which is a subsetof $O(k/\eps^2)$ scaled rows from the $n\times d$ input matrix, thatapproximates the sub of squared distances from its rows to every$k$-dimensional subspace in $\REAL^d$, up to a factor of $1\pm\eps$. An opentheoretical problem has been whether we can compute such a coreset that isindependent of the input matrix and also a weighted subset of its rows. %Anopen practical problem has been whether we can compute a non-trivialapproximation to the reduced SVD of very large databases such as the Wikipediadocument-term matrix in a reasonable time. We answer this questionaffirmatively. % and demonstrate an algorithm that efficiently computes a lowrank approximation of the entire English Wikipedia. Our main technical resultis a novel technique for deterministic coreset construction that is based on areduction to the problem of $\ell_2$ approximation for item frequencies.

An Effective Algorithmic Framework for Near Optimal Multi-Robot Path  Planning

  We present a centralized algorithmic framework for solving multi-robot pathplanning problems in general, two-dimensional, continuous environments whileminimizing globally the task completion time. The framework obtains high levelsof effectiveness through the composition of an optimal discretization of thecontinuous environment and the subsequent fast, near-optimal resolution of theresulting discrete planning problem. This principled approach achieves ordersof magnitudes better performance with respect to both speed and the supportedrobot density. For a wide variety of environments, our method is shown tocompute globally near-optimal solutions for fifty robots in seconds with robotspacked close to each other. In the extreme, the method can consistently solveproblems with hundreds of robots that occupy over 30% of the free space.

Printable Hydraulics: A Method for Fabricating Robots by 3D Co-Printing  Solids and Liquids

  This work introduces a novel technique for fabricating functional robotsusing 3D printers. Simultaneously depositing photopolymers and a non-curingliquid allows complex, pre-filled fluidic channels to be fabricated. This newprinting capability enables complex hydraulically actuated robots and roboticcomponents to be automatically built, with no assembly required. The techniqueis showcased by printing linear bellows actuators, gear pumps, soft grippersand a hexapod robot, using a commercially-available 3D printer. We detail thesteps required to modify the printer and describe the design constraintsimposed by this new fabrication approach.

A Portable, 3D-Printing Enabled Multi-Vehicle Platform for Robotics  Research and Education

  microMVP is an affordable, portable, and open source micro-scale mobile robotplatform designed for robotics research and education. As a complete and uniquemulti-vehicle platform enabled by 3D printing and the maker culture, microMVPcan be easily reproduced and requires little maintenance: a set of six microvehicles, each measuring $8\times 5\times 6$ cubic centimeters and weighingunder $100$ grams, and the accompanying tracking platform can be fullyassembled in under two hours, all from readily available components. In thispaper, we describe microMVP's hardware and software architecture, and thedesign thoughts that go into the making of the platform. The capabilities ofmicroMVP APIs are then demonstrated with several single- and multi-robot pathand motion planning algorithms. microMVP supports all common operation systems.

Baxter's Homunculus: Virtual Reality Spaces for Teleoperation in  Manufacturing

  Expensive specialized systems have hampered development of teleroboticsystems for manufacturing systems. In this paper we demonstrate a teleroboticsystem which can reduce the cost of such system by leveraging commercialvirtual reality(VR) technology and integrating it with existing roboticscontrol software. The system runs on a commercial gaming engine using off theshelf VR hardware. This system can be deployed on multiple networkarchitectures from a wired local network to a wireless network connection overthe Internet. The system is based on the homunculus model of mind wherein weembed the user in a virtual reality control room. The control room allows formultiple sensor display, dynamic mapping between the user and robot, does notrequire the production of duals for the robot, or its environment. The controlroom is mapped to a space inside the robot to provide a sense of co-locationwithin the robot. We compared our system with state of the art automationalgorithms for assembly tasks, showing a 100% success rate for our systemcompared with a 66% success rate for automated systems. We demonstrate that oursystem can be used for pick and place, assembly, and manufacturing tasks.

A General Framework for Multi-vehicle Cooperative Localization Using  Pose Graph

  When a vehicle observes another one, the two vehicles' poses are correlatedby this spatial relative observation, which can be used in cooperativelocalization for further increasing localization accuracy and precision. To usespatial relative observations, we propose to add them into a pose graph foroptimal pose estimation. Before adding them, we need to know the identities ofthe observed vehicles. The vehicle identification is formulated as a linearassignment problem, which can be solved efficiently. By using pose graphtechniques and the start-of-the-art factor composition/decomposition method,our cooperative localization algorithm is robust against communication delay,packet loss, and out-of-sequence packet reception. We demonstrate the usabilityof our framework and effectiveness of our algorithm through both simulationsand real-world experiments using three vehicles on the road.

Coresets for Vector Summarization with Applications to Network Graphs

  We provide a deterministic data summarization algorithm that approximates themean $\bar{p}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{p\in P} p$ of a set $P$ of $n$ vectors in$\REAL^d$, by a weighted mean $\tilde{p}$ of a \emph{subset} of $O(1/\eps)$vectors, i.e., independent of both $n$ and $d$. We prove that the squaredEuclidean distance between $\bar{p}$ and $\tilde{p}$ is at most $\eps$multiplied by the variance of $P$. We use this algorithm to maintain anapproximated sum of vectors from an unbounded stream, using memory that isindependent of $d$, and logarithmic in the $n$ vectors seen so far. Our mainapplication is to extract and represent in a compact way friend groups andactivity summaries of users from underlying data exchanges. For example, in thecase of mobile networks, we can use GPS traces to identify meetings, in thecase of social networks, we can use information exchange to identify friendgroups. Our algorithm provably identifies the {\it Heavy Hitter} entries in aproximity (adjacency) matrix. The Heavy Hitters can be used to extract andrepresent in a compact way friend groups and activity summaries of users fromunderlying data exchanges. We evaluate the algorithm on several large datasets.

Functional Co-Optimization of Articulated Robots

  We present parametric trajectory optimization, a method for simultaneouslycomputing physical parameters, actuation requirements, and robot motions formore efficient robot designs. In this scheme, robot dimensions, masses, andother physical parameters are solved for concurrently with traditional motionplanning variables, including dynamically consistent robot states, actuationinputs, and contact forces. Our method requires minimal user domain knowledge,requiring only a coarse guess of the target robot configuration sequence and aparameterized robot topology as input. We demonstrate our results on foursimulated robots, one of which we physically fabricated in order to demonstratephysical consistency. We demonstrate that by optimizing robot body parametersalongside robot trajectories, motion planning problems which would otherwise beinfeasible can be made feasible, and actuation requirements can besignificantly reduced.

A Nonparametric Model for Multimodal Collaborative Activities  Summarization

  Ego-centric data streams provide a unique opportunity to reason about jointbehavior by pooling data across individuals. This is especially evident inurban environments teeming with human activities, but which suffer fromincomplete and noisy data. Collaborative human activities exhibit commonspatial, temporal, and visual characteristics facilitating inference acrossindividuals from multiple sensory modalities as we explore in this paper fromthe perspective of meetings. We propose a new Bayesian nonparametric model thatenables us to efficiently pool video and GPS data towards collaborativeactivities analysis from multiple individuals. We demonstrate the utility ofthis model for inference tasks such as activity detection, classification, andsummarization. We further demonstrate how spatio-temporal structure embedded inour model enables better understanding of partial and noisy observations suchas localization and face detections based on social interactions. We showresults on both synthetic experiments and a new dataset of egocentric video andnoisy GPS data from multiple individuals.

A General Pipeline for 3D Detection of Vehicles

  Autonomous driving requires 3D perception of vehicles and other objects inthe in environment. Much of the current methods support 2D vehicle detection.This paper proposes a flexible pipeline to adopt any 2D detection network andfuse it with a 3D point cloud to generate 3D information with minimum changesof the 2D detection networks. To identify the 3D box, an effective modelfitting algorithm is developed based on generalised car models and score maps.A two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to refine thedetected 3D box. This pipeline is tested on the KITTI dataset using twodifferent 2D detection networks. The 3D detection results based on these twonetworks are similar, demonstrating the flexibility of the proposed pipeline.The results rank second among the 3D detection algorithms, indicating itscompetencies in 3D detection.

Data-Dependent Coresets for Compressing Neural Networks with  Applications to Generalization Bounds

  We present an efficient coresets-based neural network compression algorithmthat sparsifies the parameters of a trained fully-connected neural network in amanner that provably approximates the network's output. Our approach is basedon an importance sampling scheme that judiciously defines a samplingdistribution over the neural network parameters, and as a result, retainsparameters of high importance while discarding redundant ones. We leverage anovel, empirical notion of sensitivity and extend traditional coresetconstructions to the application of compressing parameters. Our theoreticalanalysis establishes guarantees on the size and accuracy of the resultingcompressed network and gives rise to generalization bounds that may provide newinsights into the generalization properties of neural networks. We demonstratethe practical effectiveness of our algorithm on a variety of neural networkconfigurations and real-world data sets.

Spatial Uncertainty Sampling for End-to-End Control

  End-to-end trained neural networks (NNs) are a compelling approach toautonomous vehicle control because of their ability to learn complex taskswithout manual engineering of rule-based decisions. However, challenging roadconditions, ambiguous navigation situations, and safety considerations requirereliable uncertainty estimation for the eventual adoption of full-scaleautonomous vehicles. Bayesian deep learning approaches provide a way toestimate uncertainty by approximating the posterior distribution of weightsgiven a set of training data. Dropout training in deep NNs approximatesBayesian inference in a deep Gaussian process and can thus be used to estimatemodel uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian NN for end-to-endcontrol that estimates uncertainty by exploiting feature map correlation duringtraining. This approach achieves improved model fits, as well as tighteruncertainty estimates, than traditional element-wise dropout. We evaluate ouralgorithms on a challenging dataset collected over many different road types,times of day, and weather conditions, and demonstrate how uncertainties can beused in conjunction with a human controller in a parallel autonomous setting.

Response Characterization for Auditing Cell Dynamics in Long Short-term  Memory Networks

  In this paper, we introduce a novel method to interpret recurrent neuralnetworks (RNNs), particularly long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) at thecellular level. We propose a systematic pipeline for interpreting individualhidden state dynamics within the network using response characterizationmethods. The ranked contribution of individual cells to the network's output iscomputed by analyzing a set of interpretable metrics of their decoupled stepand sinusoidal responses. As a result, our method is able to uniquely identifyneurons with insightful dynamics, quantify relationships between dynamicalproperties and test accuracy through ablation analysis, and interpret theimpact of network capacity on a network's dynamical distribution. Finally, wedemonstrate generalizability and scalability of our method by evaluating aseries of different benchmark sequential datasets.

Liquid Time-constant Recurrent Neural Networks as Universal  Approximators

  In this paper, we introduce the notion of liquid time-constant (LTC)recurrent neural networks (RNN)s, a subclass of continuous-time RNNs, withvarying neuronal time-constant realized by their nonlinear synaptictransmission model. This feature is inspired by the communication principles inthe nervous system of small species. It enables the model to approximatecontinuous mapping with a small number of computational units. We show that anyfinite trajectory of an $n$-dimensional continuous dynamical system can beapproximated by the internal state of the hidden units and $n$ output units ofan LTC network. Here, we also theoretically find bounds on their neuronalstates and varying time-constant.

Optimal Path Planning under Temporal Logic Constraints

  In this paper we present a method for automatically generating optimal robottrajectories satisfying high level mission specifications. The motion of therobot in the environment is modeled as a general transition system, enhancedwith weighted transitions. The mission is specified by a general lineartemporal logic formula. In addition, we require that an optimizing propositionmust be repeatedly satisfied. The cost function that we seek to minimize is themaximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. Forevery environment model, and for every formula, our method computes a robottrajectory which minimizes the cost function. The problem is motivated byapplications in robotic monitoring and data gathering. In this setting, theoptimizing proposition is satisfied at all locations where data can beuploaded, and the entire formula specifies a complex (and infinite horizon)data collection mission. Our method utilizes B\"uchi automata to produce anautomaton (which can be thought of as a graph) whose runs satisfy the temporallogic specification. We then present a graph algorithm which computes a pathcorresponding to the optimal robot trajectory. We also present animplementation for a robot performing a data gathering mission in a roadnetwork.

Persistent Robotic Tasks: Monitoring and Sweeping in Changing  Environments

  We present controllers that enable mobile robots to persistently monitor orsweep a changing environment. The changing environment is modeled as a fieldwhich grows in locations that are not within range of a robot, and decreases inlocations that are within range of a robot. We assume that the robots travel ongiven closed paths. The speed of each robot along its path is controlled toprevent the field from growing unbounded at any location. We consider the spaceof speed controllers that can be parametrized by a finite set of basisfunctions. For a single robot, we develop a linear program that is guaranteedto compute a speed controller in this space to keep the field bounded, if sucha controller exists. Another linear program is then derived whose solution isthe speed controller that minimizes the maximum field value over theenvironment. We extend our linear program formulation to develop a multi-robotcontroller that keeps the field bounded. The multi-robot controller has theunique feature that it does not require communication among the robots.Simulation studies demonstrate the robustness of the controllers to modelingerrors, and to stochasticity in the environment.

Rebalancing the Rebalancers: Optimally Routing Vehicles and Drivers in  Mobility-on-Demand Systems

  In this paper we study rebalancing strategies for a mobility-on-demand urbantransportation system blending customer-driven vehicles with a taxi service. Inour system, a customer arrives at one of many designated stations and istransported to any other designated station, either by driving themselves, orby being driven by an employed driver. The system allows for one-way trips, sothat customers do not have to return to their origin. When some origins anddestinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced,accumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem isaddressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the populardestinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach therebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to "rebalance therebalancers" by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with acustomer. Accordingly, in this paper we study how to optimally route therebalancing vehicles and drivers so that stability (in terms of boundedness ofthe number of waiting customers) is ensured while minimizing the number ofrebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancingdrivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one canfind the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs.Leveraging our analysis, we determine the minimum number of drivers and minimumnumber of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Interestingly, oursimulations suggest that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would needbetween 1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles.

Incremental Sampling-based Algorithm for Minimum-violation Motion  Planning

  This paper studies the problem of control strategy synthesis for dynamicalsystems with differential constraints to fulfill a given reachability goalwhile satisfying a set of safety rules. Particular attention is devoted togoals that become feasible only if a subset of the safety rules are violated.The proposed algorithm computes a control law, that minimizes the level ofunsafety while the desired goal is guaranteed to be reached. This problem ismotivated by an autonomous car navigating an urban environment while followingrules of the road such as "always travel in right lane'' and "do not changelanes frequently''. Ideas behind sampling based motion-planning algorithms,such as Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees(RRTs), are employed to incrementally construct a finite concretization of thedynamics as a durational Kripke structure. In conjunction with this, a weightedfinite automaton that captures the safety rules is used in order to find anoptimal trajectory that minimizes the violation of safety rules. We prove thatthe proposed algorithm guarantees asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost-sureconvergence to optimal solutions. We present results of simulation experimentsand an implementation on an autonomous urban mobility-on-demand system.

Scalable Secure Computation of Statistical Functions with Applications  to $k$-Nearest Neighbors

  Given a set $S$ of $n$ $d$-dimensional points, the $k$-nearest neighbors(KNN) is the problem of quickly finding $k$ points in $S$ that are nearest to aquery point $q$. The $k$-nearest neighbors problem has applications in machinelearning for classification and regression and also in searching. The secureversion of KNN where either $q$ or $S$ are encrypted, has applications such asproviding services over sensitive (such as medical or localization) data.  In this work we present the first scalable and efficient algorithm forsolving KNN with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) that is realized by apolynomial whose degree is independent of $n$, the number of points. Weimplemented our algorithm in an open source library based on HELibimplementation for the Brakerski-Gentry-Vakuntanthan's FHE scheme, and ranexperiments on MIT's OpenStack cloud. Our experiments show that given a querypoint $q$, we can find the set of 20 nearest points out of more than 1000points in less than an hour.  Our result introduces a statistical coreset, which is a data summarizationtechnique that allows statistical functions, such as moments, to be efficientlyand scalably computed. As a central tool, we design a new coin toss techniquewhich we use to build the coreset. This coin toss technique and computation ofstatistical functions may be of independent interest.

Re-purposing Compact Neuronal Circuit Policies to Govern Reinforcement  Learning Tasks

  We propose an effective method for creating interpretable control agents, by\textit{re-purposing} the function of a biological neural circuit model, togovern simulated and real world reinforcement learning (RL) test-beds. Inspiredby the structure of the nervous system of the soil-worm, \emph{C. elegans}, weintroduce \emph{Neuronal Circuit Policies} (NCPs) as a novel recurrent neuralnetwork instance with liquid time-constants, universal approximationcapabilities and interpretable dynamics. We theoretically show that they canapproximate any finite simulation time of a given continuous n-dimensionaldynamical system, with $n$ output units and some hidden units. We modelinstances of the policies and learn their synaptic and neuronal parameters tocontrol standard RL tasks and demonstrate its application for autonomousparking of a real rover robot on a pre-defined trajectory. For reconfigurationof the \emph{purpose} of the neural circuit, we adopt a search-based RLalgorithm. We show that our neuronal circuit policies perform as good as deepneural network policies with the advantage of realizing interpretable dynamicsat the cell-level. We theoretically find bounds for the time-varying dynamicsof the circuits, and introduce a novel way to reason about networks' dynamics.

ChainQueen: A Real-Time Differentiable Physical Simulator for Soft  Robotics

  Physical simulators have been widely used in robot planning and control.Among them, differentiable simulators are particularly favored, as they can beincorporated into gradient-based optimization algorithms that are efficient insolving inverse problems such as optimal control and motion planning.Simulating deformable objects is, however, more challenging compared to rigidbody dynamics. The underlying physical laws of deformable objects are morecomplex, and the resulting systems have orders of magnitude more degrees offreedom and therefore they are significantly more computationally expensive tosimulate. Computing gradients with respect to physical design or controllerparameters is typically even more computationally challenging. In this paper,we propose a real-time, differentiable hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian physicalsimulator for deformable objects, ChainQueen, based on the Moving Least SquaresMaterial Point Method (MLS-MPM). MLS-MPM can simulate deformable objectsincluding contact and can be seamlessly incorporated into inference, controland co-design systems. We demonstrate that our simulator achieves highprecision in both forward simulation and backward gradient computation. We havesuccessfully employed it in a diverse set of control tasks for soft robots,including problems with nearly 3,000 decision variables.

Variational End-to-End Navigation and Localization

  Deep learning has revolutionized the ability to learn "end-to-end" autonomousvehicle control directly from raw sensory data. While there have been recentadvances on extensions to handle forms of navigation instruction, these worksare unable to capture the full distribution of possible actions that could betaken and to reason about localization of the robot within the environment. Inthis paper, we extend end-to-end driving networks with the ability tounderstand maps. We define a novel variational network capable of learning fromraw camera data of the environment as well as higher level roadmaps to predict(1) a full probability distribution over the possible control commands; and (2)a deterministic control command capable of navigating on the route specifiedwithin the map. Additionally, we formulate how our model can be used tolocalize the robot according to correspondences between the map and theobserved visual road topology, inspired by the rough localization that humandrivers can perform. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world driving data, andreason about the robustness of the inferred steering commands under varioustypes of rich driving scenarios. In addition, we evaluate our localizationalgorithm over a new set of roads and intersections which the model has neverdriven through and demonstrate rough localization in situations without any GPSprior.

Persistent Monitoring of Events with Stochastic Arrivals at Multiple  Stations

  This paper introduces a new mobile sensor scheduling problem, involving asingle robot tasked with monitoring several events of interest that occur atdifferent locations. Of particular interest is the monitoring of transientevents that can not be easily forecast. Application areas range from naturalphenomena ({\em e.g.}, monitoring abnormal seismic activity around a volcanousing a ground robot) to urban activities ({\em e.g.}, monitoring earlyformations of traffic congestion using an aerial robot). Motivated by those andmany other examples, this paper focuses on problems in which the preciseoccurrence times of the events are unknown {\em a priori}, but statistics fortheir inter-arrival times are available. The robot's task is to monitor theevents to optimize the following two objectives: {\em (i)} maximize the numberof events observed and {\em (ii)} minimize the delay between two consecutiveobservations of events occurring at the same location. The paper considers thecase when a robot is tasked with optimizing the event observations in abalanced manner, following a cyclic patrolling route. First, assuming thecyclic ordering of stations is known, we prove the existence and uniqueness ofthe optimal solution, and show that the optimal solution has desirableconvergence and robustness properties. Our constructive proof also produces anefficient algorithm for computing the unique optimal solution with $O(n)$ timecomplexity, in which $n$ is the number of stations, with $O(\log n)$ timecomplexity for incrementally adding or removing stations. Except for thealgorithm, most of the analysis remains valid when the cyclic order is unknown.We then provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme that gives a$(1+\epsilon)$-optimal solution for this more general, NP-hard problem.

Toward a Science of Autonomy for Physical Systems

  Our lives have been immensely improved by decades of automation research --we are more comfortable, more productive and safer than ever before. Justimagine a world where familiar automation technologies have failed. In thatworld, thermostats don't work -- you have to monitor your home heating systemmanually. Cruise control for your car doesn't exist. Every elevator has to havea human operator to hit the right floor, most manufactured products areassembled by hand, and you have to wash your own dishes. Who would willinglyadopt that world -- the world of last century -- today? Physical systems --elevators, cars, home appliances, manufacturing equipment -- were moretroublesome, ore time consuming, less safe, and far less convenient. Now,suppose we put ourselves in the place someone 20 years in the future, a futureof autonomous systems. A future where transportation is largely autonomous,more efficient, and far safer; a future where dangerous occupations like miningor disaster response are performed by autonomous systems supervised remotely byhumans; a future where manufacturing and healthcare are twice as productive perperson-hour by having smart monitoring and readily re-tasked autonomousphysical agents; a future where the elderly and infirm have 24 hour in-homeautonomous support for the basic activities, both physical and social, of dailylife. In a future world where these capabilities are commonplace, why wouldsomeone come back to today's world where someone has to put their life at riskto do a menial job, we lose time to mindless activities that have no intrinsicvalue, or be consumed with worry that a loved one is at risk in their own home?In what follows, and in a series of associated essays, we expand on theseideas, and frame both the opportunities and challenges posed by autonomousphysical systems.
