Community Detection in Political Twitter Networks using Nonnegative  Matrix Factorization Methods

  Community detection is a fundamental task in social network analysis. In thispaper, first we develop an endorsement filtered user connectivity network byutilizing Heider's structural balance theory and certain Twitter triadpatterns. Next, we develop three Nonnegative Matrix Factorization frameworks toinvestigate the contributions of different types of user connectivity andcontent information in community detection. We show that user content andendorsement filtered connectivity information are complementary to each otherin clustering politically motivated users into pure political communities. Wordusage is the strongest indicator of users' political orientation among allcontent categories. Incorporating user-word matrix and word similarityregularizer provides the missing link in connectivity only methods which sufferfrom detection of artificially large number of clusters for Twitter networks.

Sentiment-driven Community Profiling and Detection on Social Media

  Web 2.0 helps to expand the range and depth of conversation on many issuesand facilitates the formation of online communities. Online communities drawvarious individuals together based on their common opinions on a core set ofissues. Most existing community detection methods merely focus on discoveringcommunities without providing any insight regarding the collective opinions ofcommunity members and the motives behind the formation of communities. Severalefforts have been made to tackle this problem by presenting a set of keywordsas a community profile. However, they neglect the positions of communitymembers towards keywords, which play an important role for understandingcommunities in the highly polarized atmosphere of social media. To this end, wepresent a sentiment-driven community profiling and detection framework whichaims to provide community profiles presenting positive and negative collectiveopinions of community members separately. With this regard, our frameworkinitially extracts key expressions in users' messages as representative ofissues and then identifies users' positive/negative attitudes towards these keyexpressions. Next, it uncovers a low-dimensional latent space in order tocluster users according to their opinions and social interactions (i.e.,retweets). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework throughquantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Detecting Antagonistic and Allied Communities on Social Media

  Community detection on social media has attracted considerable attention formany years. However, existing methods do not reveal the relations betweencommunities. Communities can form alliances or engage in antagonisms due tovarious factors, e.g., shared or conflicting goals and values. Uncovering suchrelations can provide better insights to understand communities and thestructure of social media. According to social science findings, the attitudesthat members from different communities express towards each other are largelyshaped by their community membership. Hence, we hypothesize thatinter-community attitudes expressed among users in social media have thepotential to reflect their inter-community relations. Therefore, we firstvalidate this hypothesis in the context of social media. Then, inspired by thehypothesis, we develop a framework to detect communities and their relations byjointly modeling users' attitudes and social interactions. We presentexperimental results using three real-world social media datasets todemonstrate the efficacy of our framework.

Orthogonal Rank-One Matrix Pursuit for Low Rank Matrix Completion

  In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable low rank matrixcompletion algorithm. The key idea is to extend orthogonal matching pursuitmethod from the vector case to the matrix case. We further propose an economicversion of our algorithm by introducing a novel weight updating rule to reducethe time and storage complexity. Both versions are computationally inexpensivefor each matrix pursuit iteration, and find satisfactory results in a fewiterations. Another advantage of our proposed algorithm is that it has only onetunable parameter, which is the rank. It is easy to understand and to use bythe user. This becomes especially important in large-scale learning problems.In addition, we rigorously show that both versions achieve a linear convergencerate, which is significantly better than the previous known results. We alsoempirically compare the proposed algorithms with several state-of-the-artmatrix completion algorithms on many real-world datasets, including thelarge-scale recommendation dataset Netflix as well as the MovieLens datasets.Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm is more efficient thancompeting algorithms while achieving similar or better prediction performance.
