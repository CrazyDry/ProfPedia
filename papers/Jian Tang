Probing the Nucleon's Transversity Via Two-Meson Production in Polarized  Nucleon-Nucleon Collisions

  We explore the possibility of probing the nucleon's transversity distribution$\delta q(x)$ through the final state interaction between two mesons($\pi^+\pi^-$, $\pi K$, or $K\bar K$) produced in transversely polarizednucleon-nucleon collisions. We present a single spin asymmetry and estimate itsmagnitude under some assumptions for the transversity distribution function andthe unknown interference fragmentation function.

  The geometric effects of the beam in near detectors at a neutrino factory arediscussed. The refined systematics treatment, including cross section errors,flux errors and background uncertainties, is compared with the IDS-NF one.Different near detector setups are included. We also probe their effects bothat the measurements of standard neutrino oscillation parameters and constraintsof the non-standard neutrino interaction.

Classical simulation of Quantum Entanglement using Optical Transverse  Modes in Multimode Waveguides

  We discuss mode-entangled states based on the optical transverse modes of theoptical field propagating in multi-mode waveguides, which are classical analogsof the quantum entangled states. The analogs are discussed in detail, includingthe violation of the Bell inequality and the correlation properties of opticalpulses' group delays. The research on these analogs may be important, for itnot only provides useful insights into fundamental features of quantumentanglement, but also yields new insights into quantum computation and quantumcommunication.

Quantum secure direct communication without using perfect quantum  channel

  Most of the quantum secure direct communication protocol needs apre-established secure quantum channel. Only after insuring the security ofquantum channel, could the sender encode the secret message and send them tothe receiver through the secure channel. In this paper, we present a quantumsecure direct communication protocol using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs. It isnot necessary for the present protocol to insure the security of quantumchannel before transmitting the secret message. In the present protocol, allEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs are used to transmit the secret message exceptthose chosen for eavesdropping check.

Quantum signature scheme with single photons

  Quantum digital signature combines quantum theory with classical digitalsignature. The main goal of this field is to take advantage of quantum effectsto provide unconditionally secure signature. We present a quantum signaturescheme with message recovery without using entangle effect. The most importantproperty of the proposed scheme is that it is not necessary for the scheme touse Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The present scheme utilizes singlephotons to achieve the aim of signature and verification. The security of thescheme relies on the quantum one-time pad and quantum key distribution. Theefficiency analysis shows that the proposed scheme is an efficient scheme.

Quantum secure direct communication based on order rearrangement of  single photons

  Based on the ideal of order rearrangement and block transmission of photons,we present a quantum secure direct communication scheme using single photons.The security of the present scheme is ensured by quantum no-cloning theory andthe secret transmitting order of photons. The present scheme is efficient inthat all of the polarized photons are used to transmit the sender's secretmessage except those chosen for eavesdropping check. We also generalize thisscheme to a multiparty controlled quantum secret direct communication schemewhich the sender's secret message can only be recovered by the receiver underthe permission of all the controllers.

Quantum secure direct communication with pure entangled states

  We present a quantum secure direct communication protocol where the channelsare not maximally entangled states. The communication parties utilize decoyphotons to check eavesdropping. After ensuring the security of the quantumchannel, the sender encodes the secret message and transmits it to the receiverby using Controlled-NOT operation and von Neumann measurement. The protocol issimple and realizable with present technology. We also show the protocol issecure for noisy quantum channel.

Semiquantum key distribution using entangled states

  Recently, Boyer et al. presented a novel semiquantum key distributionprotocol [M. Boyer, D. Kenigsberg, and T. Mor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 140501(2007)], by using four quantum states, each of which is randomly prepared by Zbasis or X basis. Here we present a semiquantum key distribution protocol byusing entangled states in which quantum Alice shares a secret key withclassical Bob. We also show the protocol is secure against eavesdropping.

Rectifying full-counting statistics in a spin Seebeck engine

  We investigate the rectification and negative differential effects offull-counting statistics of conjugate thermal spin transport in a spin Seebeckengine. The engine is made by an electron/magnon interface diode driven by atemperature bias, of which the scaled cumulant generating function isformulated in the framework of nonequilibrium Green's function. The stronglyfluctuating interfacial electron density of states induced by quantum dot isresponsible for these intriguing properties. This work is relevant fordesigning efficient spin caloritronic engine and can broaden our view innonequilibrium thermodynamics and the nonlinear phenomenon in quantum transportsystem.

Premise Selection for Theorem Proving by Deep Graph Embedding

  We propose a deep learning-based approach to the problem of premiseselection: selecting mathematical statements relevant for proving a givenconjecture. We represent a higher-order logic formula as a graph that isinvariant to variable renaming but still fully preserves syntactic and semanticinformation. We then embed the graph into a vector via a novel embedding methodthat preserves the information of edge ordering. Our approach achievesstate-of-the-art results on the HolStep dataset, improving the classificationaccuracy from 83% to 90.3%.

Restudy on Dark Matter Time-Evolution in the Littlest Higgs model with  T-parity

  Following previous study, in the Littlest Higgs model (LHM), the heavy photonis supposed to be a possible dark matter candidate and its relic abundance ofthe heavy photon is estimated in terms of the Boltzman-Lee-Weinbergtime-evolution equation. The effects of the T-parity violation is alsoconsidered. Our calculations show that when Higgs mass $M_H$ taken to be 300GeV and don't consider T-parity violation, only two narrow ranges$133<M_{A_{H}}<135$ GeV and $167<M_{A_{H}}<169$ GeV are tolerable with thecurrent astrophysical observation and if $135<M_{A_{H}}<167$ GeV, there must atleast exist another species of heavy particle contributing to the cold darkmatter. As long as the T-parity can be violated, the heavy photon can decayinto regular standard model particles and would affect the dark matterabundance in the universe, we discuss the constraint on the T-parity violationparameter based on the present data. Direct detection prospects are alsodiscussed in some detail.

Phenomenology of Neutrino Oscillations at the Neutrino Factory

  We consider the prospects for a neutrino factory to measure mixing angles,the CP violating phase and mass-squared differences by detecting wrong-chargedmuons arising from the chain \mu^+ to \nu_e to \nu_\mu\ to \mu^- and theright-charged muons coming from the chain \mu^+ to \bar{\nu}_\mu\ to\bar{\nu}_\mu\ to \mu^+ (similar to \mu^- chains), where \nu_e to \nu_\mu\ and\bar{\nu}_\mu\ to \bar{\nu}_\mu\ are neutrino oscillation channels through along baseline. First, we perform the baseline and energy optimization of theneutrino factory including the latest simulation results from the magnetizediron neutrino detector (MIND). Second, we study physics with near detectors andconsider the treatment of systematic errors including cross section errors,flux errors, and background uncertainties. Third, the effects of one additionalmassive sterile neutrino are investigated in the context of near and fardetector combinations.

LINE: Large-scale Information Network Embedding

  This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networksinto low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such asvisualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graphembedding methods do not scale for real world information networks whichusually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel networkembedding method called the "LINE," which is suitable for arbitrary types ofinformation networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The methodoptimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the localand global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed thataddresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent andimproves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empiricalexperiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-worldinformation networks, including language networks, social networks, andcitation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn theembedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a fewhours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is availableonline.

Identity-sensitive Word Embedding through Heterogeneous Networks

  Most existing word embedding approaches do not distinguish the same words indifferent contexts, therefore ignoring their contextual meanings. As a result,the learned embeddings of these words are usually a mixture of multiplemeanings. In this paper, we acknowledge multiple identities of the same word indifferent contexts and learn the \textbf{identity-sensitive} word embeddings.Based on an identity-labeled text corpora, a heterogeneous network of words andword identities is constructed to model different-levels of wordco-occurrences. The heterogeneous network is further embedded into alow-dimensional space through a principled network embedding approach, throughwhich we are able to obtain the embeddings of words and the embeddings of wordidentities. We study three different types of word identities including topics,sentiments and categories. Experimental results on real-world data sets showthat the identity-sensitive word embeddings learned by our approach indeedcapture different meanings of words and outperforms competitive methods ontasks including text classification and word similarity computation.

Context-aware Natural Language Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks

  This paper studied generating natural languages at particular contexts orsituations. We proposed two novel approaches which encode the contexts into acontinuous semantic representation and then decode the semantic representationinto text sequences with recurrent neural networks. During decoding, thecontext information are attended through a gating mechanism, addressing theproblem of long-range dependency caused by lengthy sequences. We evaluate theeffectiveness of the proposed approaches on user review data, in which richcontexts are available and two informative contexts, sentiments and products,are selected for evaluation. Experiments show that the fake reviews generatedby our approaches are very natural. Results of fake review detection with humanjudges show that more than 50\% of the fake reviews are misclassified as thereal reviews, and more than 90\% are misclassified by existing state-of-the-artfake review detection algorithm.

Study of Non-Standard Charged-Current Interactions at the MOMENT  experiment

  MuOn-decay MEdium baseline NeuTrino beam experiment (MOMENT) is anext-generation accelerator neutrino experiment looking for more physics study.We try to simulate neutrino oscillations confronting withCharged-Current\&Non-Standard neutrino Interactions(CC-NSIs) at MOMENT. TheseNSIs could alter neutrino production and detection processes and get involvedin neutrino oscillation channels. We separate a perturbative discussion ofoscillation channels at near and far detectors, and analyze parametercorrelations with the impact of CC-NSIs. Taking $\delta_{cp}$ and $\theta_{23}$as an example, we find that CC-NSIs can induce bias in precision measurementsof standard oscillation parameters. In addition, a combination of near and fardetectors using Gd-doped water cherenkov technology at MOMENT is able toprovide good constraints of CC-NSIs happening at the neutrino production anddetection processes.

End-to-end Learning for Short Text Expansion

  Effectively making sense of short texts is a critical task for many realworld applications such as search engines, social media services, andrecommender systems. The task is particularly challenging as a short textcontains very sparse information, often too sparse for a machine learningalgorithm to pick up useful signals. A common practice for analyzing short textis to first expand it with external information, which is usually harvestedfrom a large collection of longer texts. In literature, short text expansionhas been done with all kinds of heuristics. We propose an end-to-end solutionthat automatically learns how to expand short text to optimize a given learningtask. A novel deep memory network is proposed to automatically find relevantinformation from a collection of longer documents and reformulate the shorttext through a gating mechanism. Using short text classification as ademonstrating task, we show that the deep memory network significantlyoutperforms classical text expansion methods with comprehensive experiments onreal world data sets.

Extracting nuclear form factors with coherent neutrino scattering

  Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) can be used to determinethe neutron part of nuclear form factors, unlocking intrinsic properties ofnuclear structure. In contrast with other such methods, CEvNS is free from bothstrong interaction effects and Coulomb distortions. We propose precisionmeasurements of CEvNS with an upcoming accelerator facility and determine thecorresponding requirements for such a neutrino detector. We find that mostsignificant backgrounds come from fast neutrons, induced by cosmogenic muons orfrom the pion decays at rest in the target station. With ton-scale liquid noblegas detectors, we will not only achieve percent level precision in themeasurement of neutron radii but also clarify contributions of higher-ordermoments to nuclear form factors.

Quantum coherence across bosonic superconductor-anomalous  metal-insulator transitions

  After decades of explorations, suffering from low critical temperature andsubtle nature, whether a metallic ground state exists in a two-dimensionalsystem beyond Anderson localization is still a mystery. Supremely, phasecoherence could be the key that unlocks its intriguing nature. This workreveals how quantum phase coherence evolves across bosonicsuperconductor-metal-insulator transitions via magneto-conductance quantumoscillations in high-Tc superconducting films. A robust intervening anomalousmetallic state characterized by both resistance and oscillation amplitudesaturations in the low temperature regime is detected. By contrast, withdecreasing temperature the oscillation amplitude monotonically grows on thesuperconducting side, but decreases at low temperatures on the insulating side.It suggests that the saturation of phase coherence plays a prominent role inthe formation of this anomalous metallic state.

Interference Fragmentation Functions and the Nucleon's Transversity

  We introduce twist-two quark interference fragmentation functions in helicitydensity matrix formalism and study their physical implications. We show how thenucleon's transversity distribution can be probed through the final stateinteraction between two mesons ($\pi^+\pi^-$, $K\bar K$, or $\pi K$) producedin the current fragmentation region in deep inelastic scattering on atransversely polarized nucleon.

Can Transversity Be Measured?

  I review the ways that have been proposed to measure the quark transversitydistribution in the nucleon. I then explain a proposal, developed by XueminJin, Jian Tang and myself, to measure transversity through the final stateinteraction between two mesons ($\pi\pi$, $K \bar K$, or $\pi K$) produced inthe current fragmentation region in deep inelastic scattering on a transverselypolarized nucleon.

Interference Fragmentation Functions and Valence Quark Spin  Distributions in the Nucleon

  We explore further applications of the twist-two quark interferencefragmentation functions introduced earlier. We show that semi-inclusiveproduction of two pions in the current fragmentation region in deep inelasticscattering of a longitudinally polarized electron on a longitudinally polarizednucleon can provide a probe of the valence quark spin (or helicity difference)distribution in the nucleon.

Study on the imaging ability of the 2D neutron detector based on MWPC

  A 2D neutron detector based on 3He convertor and MWPC with an active area of200 mm \times 200 mm has been successfully designed and fabricated. Thedetector has been tested with Am/Be neutron source and with collimated neutronbeam with wavelength of {\lambda} = 1.37 {\AA}. A best spatial resolution of1.18 mm (FWHM) and good linearity were obtained. This is in good agreement withthe theoretical calculations.

1-bit Compressive Data Gathering for Wireless Sensor Networks

  Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely used for the data gathering inwireless sensor networks for the purpose of reducing the communication overheadrecent years. In this paper, we first show that with simple modification, 1-bitcompressive sensing can also been used for the data gathering in wirelesssensor networks to further reduce the communication overhead. We also propose anovel blind 1-bit CS reconstruction algorithm which outperforms other state ofthe art blind 1-bit CS reconstruction algorithms. Experimental results on realsensor datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our method.

The optimal search on graph by continuous-time quantum walks

  Chakraborty and Leonardo have shown that a spatial search by quantum walk isoptimal for almost all graphs. However, we observed that on some graphs,certain states cannot be searched optimally. We present a method forconstructing an optimal graph that searches an arbitrary state and provides theoptimal condition. We also analyze the monotonicity of the search performanceand conclude that the search performance can be improved by adding edges.

Exceed Improved Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells Under Dual-Irradiation  System

  In general, perovskite solar cells (PSC) with a sensitized or thin filmarchitecture absorb light from a single illumination. This paper reported a PSCarchitecture with a semitransparent Au/ITO counter electrode, which allowslight to pass it partially. When the device was illuminated simultaneously fromboth the FTO and Au/ITO sides, the PSC has achieved an overall power conversionefficiency (PCE) as high as 20.1% under high light intensity (1.4 sun), whichis much higher than that of the single-irradiation system.

Carboxyl Carbon Quantum Dots: a Novel Type of Environmental-Friendly  Scale Inhibitor

  In this work, we demonstrate high inhibition efficiency of carboxyl carbonquantum dots (CCQDs) for the first time. The as-prepared CCQDs have excellentscale inhibition performance for calcium sulfate and barium sulfate. Withstatic test of scale inhibition within temperature below 80 degrees, theanti-scaling efficiency can reach 100 % with low additions of CCQDs.

PTE: Predictive Text Embedding through Large-scale Heterogeneous Text  Networks

  Unsupervised text embedding methods, such as Skip-gram and Paragraph Vector,have been attracting increasing attention due to their simplicity, scalability,and effectiveness. However, comparing to sophisticated deep learningarchitectures such as convolutional neural networks, these methods usuallyyield inferior results when applied to particular machine learning tasks. Onepossible reason is that these text embedding methods learn the representationof text in a fully unsupervised way, without leveraging the labeled informationavailable for the task. Although the low dimensional representations learnedare applicable to many different tasks, they are not particularly tuned for anytask. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a semi-supervisedrepresentation learning method for text data, which we call the\textit{predictive text embedding} (PTE). Predictive text embedding utilizesboth labeled and unlabeled data to learn the embedding of text. The labeledinformation and different levels of word co-occurrence information are firstrepresented as a large-scale heterogeneous text network, which is then embeddedinto a low dimensional space through a principled and efficient algorithm. Thislow dimensional embedding not only preserves the semantic closeness of wordsand documents, but also has a strong predictive power for the particular task.Compared to recent supervised approaches based on convolutional neuralnetworks, predictive text embedding is comparable or more effective, much moreefficient, and has fewer parameters to tune.

A Sharp Condition for Exact Support Recovery of with Orthogonal Matching  Pursuit

  Support recovery of sparse signals from noisy measurements with orthogonalmatching pursuit (OMP) has been extensively studied. In this paper, we showthat for any $K$-sparse signal $\x$, if a sensing matrix $\A$ satisfies therestricted isometry property (RIP) with restricted isometry constant (RIC)$\delta_{K+1} < 1/\sqrt {K+1}$, then under some constraints on the minimummagnitude of nonzero elements of $\x$, OMP exactly recovers the support of $\x$from its measurements $\y=\A\x+\v$ in $K$ iterations, where $\v$ is a noisevector that is $\ell_2$ or $\ell_{\infty}$ bounded. This sufficient conditionis sharp in terms of $\delta_{K+1}$ since for any given positive integer $K$and any $1/\sqrt{K+1}\leq \delta<1$, there always exists a matrix $\A$satisfying the RIP with $\delta_{K+1}=\delta$ for which OMP fails to recover a$K$-sparse signal $\x$ in $K$ iterations. Also, our constraints on the minimummagnitude of nonzero elements of $\x$ are weaker than existing ones. Moreover,we propose worst-case necessary conditions for the exact support recovery of$\x$, characterized by the minimum magnitude of the nonzero elements of $\x$.

Visualizing Large-scale and High-dimensional Data

  We study the problem of visualizing large-scale and high-dimensional data ina low-dimensional (typically 2D or 3D) space. Much success has been reportedrecently by techniques that first compute a similarity structure of the datapoints and then project them into a low-dimensional space with the structurepreserved. These two steps suffer from considerable computational costs,preventing the state-of-the-art methods such as the t-SNE from scaling tolarge-scale and high-dimensional data (e.g., millions of data points andhundreds of dimensions). We propose the LargeVis, a technique that firstconstructs an accurately approximated K-nearest neighbor graph from the dataand then layouts the graph in the low-dimensional space. Comparing to t-SNE,LargeVis significantly reduces the computational cost of the graph constructionstep and employs a principled probabilistic model for the visualization step,the objective of which can be effectively optimized through asynchronousstochastic gradient descent with a linear time complexity. The whole procedurethus easily scales to millions of high-dimensional data points. Experimentalresults on real-world data sets demonstrate that the LargeVis outperforms thestate-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. Thehyper-parameters of LargeVis are also much more stable over different datasets.

Less is More: Learning Prominent and Diverse Topics for Data  Summarization

  Statistical topic models efficiently facilitate the exploration oflarge-scale data sets. Many models have been developed and broadly used tosummarize the semantic structure in news, science, social media, and digitalhumanities. However, a common and practical objective in data exploration tasksis not to enumerate all existing topics, but to quickly extract representativeones that broadly cover the content of the corpus, i.e., a few topics thatserve as a good summary of the data. Most existing topic models fit exactly thesame number of topics as a user specifies, which have imposed an unnecessaryburden to the users who have limited prior knowledge. We instead propose newmodels that are able to learn fewer but more representative topics for thepurpose of data summarization. We propose a reinforced random walk that allowsprominent topics to absorb tokens from similar and smaller topics, thusenhances the diversity among the top topics extracted. With this reinforcedrandom walk as a general process embedded in classical topic models, we obtain\textit{diverse topic models} that are able to extract the most prominent anddiverse topics from data. The inference procedures of these diverse topicmodels remain as simple and efficient as the classical models. Experimentalresults demonstrate that the diverse topic models not only discover topics thatbetter summarize the data, but also require minimal prior knowledge of theusers.

Design of Near Infrared Sky Brightness Monitor and Test Running at Ngari  Observatory in Tibet

  Tibet is known as the third pole of the earth, as high as the South Pole andNorth Pole. The Ngari (Ali) observatory in Tibet has the advantage of plenty ofphotometric night, low precipitable water vapor, high transmittance, goodseeing. It is a good site, and promising to be one of the best place forinfrared and submillimeter observations in the world. However, there is no dataavailable for sky background brightness in such place, which restrict theastronomical development of the sites. In the near infrared band of J, H, Ks, aNIR sky brightness monitor (NISBM) is designed based on InGaAs photoelectricdiode. By using the method of chopper modulation and digital lock-in amplifierprocessing, the SNR (Signal Noise Ratio), detectivity and the data acquisitionspeed of the device is greatly improved. For each band of J, H, Ks, anindependent instrument is designed and calibrated in laboratory. The NISBM hasbeen installed in Ngari observatory in July of 2017 and obtained the first dataof NIR sky brightness at Ngari observatory.

Quantum key distribution protocols using entangled state

  We present three quantum key distribution protocols using entangled state. Inthe first two protocols, all Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs are used todistribute a secret key except those chosen for eavesdropping check, becausethe communication parties measure each of their particles in an invariablemeasuring basis. The first protocol is based on the ideal of qubit transmissionin blocks. Although it need quantum memory, its theoretic efficiencyapproximates to 100%. The second protocol does not need quantum memory and itsefficiency for qubits can achieve 100%. In the third protocol, we present acontrolled quantum key distribution using three-particle entangled state tosolve a special cryptographic task. Only with the controller's permission couldthe communication parties establish their sharing key and the sharing key issecret to the controller. We also analyze the security and the efficiency ofthe present protocols.

Efficient multiparty quantum secret sharing of secure direct  communication

  In this paper, we present an (n, n) threshold quantum secret sharing schemeof secure direct communication using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Thepresent scheme is efficient in that all the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger statesused in the quantum secret sharing scheme are used to generate shared secretmessages except those chosen for checking eavesdropper. In our scheme, themeasuring basis of communication parties is invariable and the classicalinformation used to check eavesdropping needs only the results of measurementsof the communication parties. Another nice feature of our scheme is that thesender transmit her secret messages to the receivers directly and the receiversrecover the sender's secret by combining their results, different from the QSSscheme whose object is essentially to allow a sender to establish a shared keywith the receivers. This feature of our scheme is similar to that of quantumsecret direct communication.

Multiparty controlled quantum secret direct communication using  Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state

  Base on the idea of dense coding of three-photon entangled state and qubittransmission in blocks, we present a multiparty controlled quantum secretdirect communication scheme using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. In thepresent scheme, the sender transmits her three bits of secret message to thereceiver directly and the secret message can only be recovered by the receiverunder the permission of all the controllers. All three-photon entangled statesare used to transmit the secret messages except those chosen for eavesdroppingcheck and the present scheme has a high source capacity becauseGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state forms a large Hilbert space.

Quantum secure communication scheme with W state

  Recently, Cao et al. proposed a new quantum secure direct communicationscheme using W state. In their scheme, the error rate introduced by aneavesdropper who takes intercept-resend attack, is only 8.3%. Actually, theirscheme is just a quantum key distribution scheme because the communicationparties first create a shared key and then encrypt the secret message usingone-time pad. We then present a quantum secure communication scheme usingthree-qubit W state. In our scheme, the error rate is raised to 25% and it isnot necessary for the present scheme to use alternative measurement or Bellbasis measurement. We also show our scheme is unconditionally secure.

Quantum secure communication protocols based on entanglement swapping

  We present a quantum secure direct communication protocol and a multipartyquantum secret sharing protocol based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs andentanglement swapping. The present quantum secure direct communication protocolmakes use of the ideal of block transmission. We also point out that the sendercan encode his or her secret message without ensuring the security of thequantum channel firstly. In the multiparty quantum secret sharing protocol, thecommunication parties adopt checking mode or encoding mode with a certainprobability. It is not necessary for the protocol to perform local unitaryoperation. In both the protocols, one party transmits only one photon for eachEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair to another party and the security for thetransmitting photons is ensured by selecting Z-basis or X-basis randomly tomeasure the sampling photons.

Quantum broadcast communication

  Broadcast encryption allows the sender to securely distribute his/her secretto a dynamically changing group of users over a broadcast channel. In thispaper, we just consider a simple broadcast communication task in quantumscenario, which the central party broadcasts his secret to multi-receiver viaquantum channel. We present three quantum broadcast communication schemes. Thefirst scheme utilizes entanglement swapping and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilingerstate to realize a task that the central party broadcasts his secret to a groupof receivers who share a group key with him. In the second scheme, based ondense coding, the central party broadcasts the secret to multi-receiver whoshare each of their authentication key with him. The third scheme is a quantumbroadcast communication scheme with quantum encryption, which the central partycan broadcast the secret to any subset of the legal receivers.

Semiquantum secret sharing using two-particle entangled state

  Recently, Boyer et al. presented a novel semiquantum key distributionprotocol [M. Boyer, D. Kenigsberg, and T. Mor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 140501(2007)], in which quantum Alice shares a secret key with classical Bob. Li etal. proposed two semiquantum secret sharing protocols [Q. Li, W. H. Chan, andD. Y. Long, Phys. Rev. A 82, 022303 (2010)] by using maximally entangledGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. In this paper, we present a semiquantumsecret sharing protocol by using two-particle entangled states in which quantumAlice shares a secret key with two classical parties, Bob and Charlie.Classical Bob and Charlie are restricted to performing measurement in thecomputational basis, preparing a particle in the computational basis, orreflecting the particles. None of them can acquire the secret unless theycollaborate. We also show the protocol is secure against eavesdropping.

Generation of nondegenerate narrow-band photon pairs for hybrid quantum  network

  In a hybrid quantum network, linking two kinds of quantum nodes throughphotonic channels requires excellent matching of central frequency andbandwidth between both nodes and their interfacing photons. However,pre-existing photon sources can not fulfill this requirement. Using a novelconjoined double-cavity strategy, we report the generation of nondegeneratenarrow-band photon pairs by cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametricdown-conversion. The central frequencies and bandwidths of the signal and idlerphotons are independently set to match with trapped ions and solid-statequantum memories. With this source we achieve the bandwidths and centralfrequencies of 4 MHz at 935 nm and 5 MHz at 880 nm for the signal and idlerphotons respectively, with a normalized spectrum brightness of 4.9/s/MHz/mW.Due to the ability of being independently locked to two different wavelenghts,the conjoined double-cavity is universally suitable for hybrid quantum networkconsisting of various quantum nodes.

Novel voltage signal at proximity effect induced superconducting  transition temperature in gold nanowires

  We observed a novel voltage peak in the proximity effect inducedsuperconducting gold (Au) nanowire while cooling the sample through thesuperconducting transition temperature. The voltage peak turned into dip in thewarming process. The voltage peak (or dip) was found to be closely related tothe emergence (vanishing) of the proximity induced superconductivity in the Aunanowire. The amplitude of the voltage signal depends on the temperaturescanning rate and it cannot be detected when the temperature is changed slowerthan 0.03 K/min. This transient feature suggests the non-equilibrium propertyof the effect. The voltage peak could be understood by Ginzburg-Landau model asa combined result of the emergence of Cooper pairs with relatively lower freeenergy in W contact and the non-equilibrium diffusion of Cooper pairs andquasiparticles.

Anomalous quantum Griffiths singularity in ultrathin crystalline lead  films

  We study the magnetic field induced superconductor-metal transition (SMT) inultrathin crystalline Pb films. By performing ultralow temperature transportmeasurement, the divergent critical exponent as an indication of quantumGriffiths singularity (QGS) is observed when approaching zero temperaturequantum critical point. Distinctively, the phase boundary of SMT exhibits ananomalous behavior in low temperature regime that the onset critical fielddecreases with decreasing temperatures, which distinguishes our observationfrom earlier reports of QGS in various two-dimensional superconductors. Wedemonstrate that this observed anomalous phase boundary has its origin from thesuperconducting fluctuations in ultrathin Pb films. Our findings reveal a novelaspect of the QGS of SMT in two-dimentional superconducting systems withanomalous phase boundary.

Energy efficient prediction clustering algorithm for multilevel  heterogeneous wireless sensor networks

  In designing wireless sensor networks, it is important to reduce energydissipation and prolong network lifetime. In this paper, a new model withenergy and monitored objects heterogeneity is proposed for heterogeneouswireless sensor networks. We put forward an energy-efficient predictionclustering algorithm, which is adaptive to the heterogeneous model. Thisalgorithm enables the nodes to select the cluster head according to factorssuch as energy and communication cost, thus the nodes with higher residualenergy have higher probability to become a cluster head than those with lowerresidual energy, so that the network energy can be dissipated uniformly. Inorder to reduce energy consumption when broadcasting in clustering phase andprolong network lifetime, an energy consumption prediction model is establishedfor regular data acquisition nodes. Simulation results show that compared withcurrent clustering algorithms, this algorithm can achieve longer sensor networklifetime, higher energy efficiency and superior network monitoring quality.

Waiting Time Distribution of Quantum Electronic Transport in Transient  Regime

  Waiting time is an important transport quantity that is complementary toaverage current and its fluctuation. So far all the studies of waiting timedistribution (WTD) are limited to steady state transport (either dc or ac). Inthis work, we present a theory to calculate WTD for coherent electronic systemsin transient regime. We express the generating function of full countingstatistics using Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's functions formalism. Ouranalysis goes beyond the wideband approximation and is suitable for firstprinciples calculation on realistic systems. Analytic solution has beenobtained for short and long time behaviors of waiting times. At short times,the WTD shows a linear dependence on the waiting time while in the long timelimit, WTD follows Poisson distribution. We have applied this theory to aquantum dot connected by two leads and calculated cumulants of transferredcharge as well as WTD in the transient regime. We have demonstrated how torelate WTD to experimental measured data.

Exact Hybrid Covariance Thresholding for Joint Graphical Lasso

  This paper considers the problem of estimating multiple related Gaussiangraphical models from a $p$-dimensional dataset consisting of differentclasses. Our work is based upon the formulation of this problem as groupgraphical lasso. This paper proposes a novel hybrid covariance thresholdingalgorithm that can effectively identify zero entries in the precision matricesand split a large joint graphical lasso problem into small subproblems. Ourhybrid covariance thresholding method is superior to existing uniformthresholding methods in that our method can split the precision matrix of eachindividual class using different partition schemes and thus split groupgraphical lasso into much smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved veryfast. In addition, this paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditionsfor our hybrid covariance thresholding algorithm. The superior performance ofour thresholding method is thoroughly analyzed and illustrated by a fewexperiments on simulated data and real gene expression data.

New quantum codes from dual-containing cyclic codes over finite rings

  Let $R=\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}+u\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}+\cdots+u^{k}\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$, where $\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$ is a finite field with $2^{m}$ elements, $m$ is apositive integer, $u$ is an indeterminate with $u^{k+1}=0.$ In this paper, wepropose the constructions of two new families of quantum codes obtained fromdual-containing cyclic codes of odd length over $R$. A new Gray map over $R$ isdefined and a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence ofdual-containing cyclic codes over $R$ is given. A new family of $2^{m}$-aryquantum codes is obtained via the Gray map and the Calderbank-Shor-Steaneconstruction from dual-containing cyclic codes over $R.$ Furthermore, a newfamily of binary quantum codes is obtained via the Gray map, the trace map andthe Calderbank-Shor-Steane construction from dual-containing cyclic codes over$R.$

Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods for the special relativistic  magnetohydrodynamics

  This paper develops $P^K$-based non-central and central Runge-Kuttadiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods with WENO limiter for the one- andtwo-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) equations,$K=1,2,3$. The non-central DG methods are locally divergence-free, while thecentral DG are "exactly" divergence-free but have to find two approximatesolutions defined on mutually dual meshes. The adaptive WENO limiter firstidentifies the "troubled" cells by using a modified TVB minmod function, andthen uses the WENO technique to locally reconstruct a new polynomial of degree$(2K+1)$ inside the "troubled" cells replacing the DG solution by based on thecell average values of the DG solutions in the neighboring cells as well as theoriginal cell averages of the "troubled" cells. The WENO limiting proceduredoes not destroy the locally or "exactly" divergence-free property of magneticfield and is only employed for finite "troubled" cells so that thecomputational cost can be as little as possible. Several test problems in oneand two dimensions are solved by using our non-central and central Runge-KuttaDG methods with WENO limiter. The numerical results demonstrate that ourmethods are stable, accurate, and robust in resolving complex wave structures.

Short time dynamics of molecular junctions after projective measurement

  In this work, we study the short time dynamics of a molecular junctiondescribed by Anderson-Holstein model using full-counting statistics afterprojective measurement. The coupling between the central quantum dot (QD) andtwo leads was turned on at remote past and the system is evolved to steadystate at time $t=0$, when we perform the projective measurement in one of thelead. Generating function for the charge transfer is expressed as a Fredholmdeterminant in terms of Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function in the timedomain. It is found that the current is not constant at short times indicatingthat the measurement does perturb the system. We numerically compare thecurrent behaviors after the projective measurement with those in the transientregime where the subsystems are connected at $t=0$. The universal scaling forhigh-order cumulants is observed for the case with zero QD occupation due tothe unidirectional transport at short times. The influences of electron-phononinteraction on short time dynamics of electric current, shot noise anddifferential conductance are analyzed.

Economic Dispatch Considering Spatial and Temporal Correlations of  Multiple Renewable Power Plants

  The correlations of multiple renewable power plants (RPPs) should be fullyconsidered in the power system with very high penetration renewable powerintegration. This paper models the uncertainties, spatial correlation ofmultiple RPPs based on Copula theory and actual probability historicalhistograms by one-dimension distributions for economic dispatch (ED) problem.An efficient dynamic renewable power scenario generation method based on Gibbssampling is proposed to generate renewable power scenarios considering theuncertainties, spatial correlation and variability (temporal correlation) ofmultiple RPPs, in which the sampling space complexity do not increase with thenumber of RPPs. Distribution-based and scenario-based methods are proposed andcompared to solve the real-time ED problem with multiple RPPs. Results showthat the proposed dynamic scenario generation method is much more consist withthe actual renewable power. The proposed ED methods show better understandingfor the uncertainties, spatial and temporal correlations of renewable power andmore economical compared with the traditional ones.
