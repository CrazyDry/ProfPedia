On Relations among Fourier Coefficients and Sum-functions

  We generalize five theorems of Leindler on the relations among Fouriercoefficients and sum-functions under the more general $NBV$ condition.

Cluster categories for marked surfaces: punctured case

  We study the cluster categories arising from marked surfaces (with puncturesand non-empty boundaries). By constructing skewed-gentle algebras, we show thatthere is a bijection between tagged curves and string objects. Applicationsinclude interpreting dimensions of $\operatorname{Ext}^1$ as intersectionnumbers of tagged curves and Auslander-Reiten translation as tagged rotation.An important consequence is that the cluster(-tilting) exchange graphs of suchcluster categories are connected.

Decorated marked surfaces II: Intersection numbers and dimensions of  Homs

  We study the 3-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathcal{D}$ arising from quivers withpotential associated to a decorated marked surface $\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup$introduced by the first author. We prove two conjectures in the prequel, thatunder a bijection between certain objects in $\mathcal{D}$ and certain arcs in$\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup$, the dimensions of morphisms between these objectsequal the intersection numbers between the corresponding arcs.

Finite presentations for spherical/braid twist groups from decorated  marked surfaces

  We give a finite presentation for the braid twist group of a decoratedsurface. If the decorated surface arises from a triangulated marked surfacewithout punctures, we obtain a finite presentation for the spherical twistgroup of the associated 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category. Themotivation/application is that the result will be used to show that the(principal component of) space of stability conditions on the 3-Calabi-Yaucategory is simply connected in the sequel.

A Generalization of Monotonicity Condition and Applications

  In the present paper, we introduce a new class of sequences called $NBVS$ togeneralize $GBVS$, essentially extending monotonicity from "one sided" to "twosided", while some important classical results keep true.

An effective spin-1 Heisenberg chain in coupled cavities

  A coupled array of $N$ identical cavities, each of which contains afive-level atom is investigated. The results show that the atoms via theexchange of virtual photons can be effectively equal to spin 1 Heisenberg modelunder certain conditions. By tuning the laser fields, the parameters of theeffective Hamiltonian can be controlled individually.

Disentangling and broadcasting an entangled state simultaneously by  asymmetric cloning

  We construct a quantum machine which, by using asymmetric cloner, deals withdisentangling and broadcasting entanglement in a single unitary evolution. Theattainable maximum value of the scaling parameter $s$ for disentangling isidentical to that obtained in previous works. The fidelity of the cloning statewith respect to the input entangled state is state-dependent.

Remote information concentration by GHZ state and by bound entangled  state

  We compare remote information concentration by a maximally entangled GHZstate with by an unlockable bound entangled state. We find that the boundentangled state is as useful as the GHZ state, even do better than the GHZstate in the context of communication security.

On Log-concavity of the Generalized Marcum Q Function

  It is shown that, if nu >= 1/2 then the generalized Marcum Q function Q_nu(a,b) is log-concave in 0<=b <infty. This proves a conjecture of Sun, Baricz andZhou (2010). We also point out relevant results in the statistics literature.

Quantum scattering theory of Fock states in high-dimensional spaces

  A quantum scattering theory is developed for Fock states scattered bytwo-level systems in the free space. Compared to existing scattering theoriesthat treat incident light semi-classically, the theory fully quantizes theincident light as Fock states. This non-perturbative method provides exactscattering matrix.

3rd Order Temporal Correlation Function of Pseudo-Thermal Light

  This experiment reports a nontrivial third-order temporal correlation ofchaotic-thermal light in which the randomly radiated thermal light is observedto have a 6-times greater chance of being captured by three individualphotodetectors simultaneously than that of being captured by threephotodetectors at different times (separated by the coherent time ofpseudo-thermal light), indicating a "three-photon bunching" effect. Thenontrivial correlation of thermal light is the result of multi-photoninterference.

Mutation of torsion pairs in triangulated categories and its geometric  realization

  We introduce and study mutation of torsion pairs, as a generalization ofmutation of cluster tilting objects, rigid objects and maximal rigid objects.It is proved that any mutation of a torsion pair is again a torsion pair. Ageometric realization of mutation of torsion pairs in the cluster category oftype $A_n$ or $A_{\infty}$ is given via rotation of Ptolemy diagrams.

Silted algebras

  We study endomorphism algebras of 2-term silting complexes in derivedcategories of hereditary finite dimensional algebras, or more generally of$\mathop{\rm Ext}\nolimits$-finite hereditary abelian categories. Modulecategories of such endomorphism algebras are known to occur as hearts ofcertain bounded $t$-structures in such derived categories. We show that thealgebras occurring are exactly the algebras of small homological dimension,which are algebras characterized by the property that each indecomposablemodule either has injective dimension at most one, or it has projectivedimension at most one.

Endomorphism algebras of 2-term silting complexes

  We study possible values of the global dimension of endomorphism algebras of2-term silting complexes. We show that for any algebra $A$ whose globaldimension $\mathop{\rm gl. dim}\nolimits A\leq 2$ and any 2-term siltingcomplex $\mathbf{P}$ in the bounded derived category ${D^b(A)}$ of $A$, theglobal dimension of $\mathop{\rm End}\nolimits_{D^b(A)}(\mathbf{P})$ is at most7. We also show that for each $n>2$, there is an algebra $A$ with $\mathop{\rmgl. dim}\nolimits A=n$ such that ${D^b(A)}$ admits a 2-term silting complex$\mathbf{P}$ with $\mathop{\rm gl. dim}\nolimits \mathop{\rmEnd}\nolimits_{D^b(A)}(\mathbf{P})$ infinite.

Cotorsion pairs in cluster categories of type $A_{\infty}^{\infty}$

  In this paper, we give a complete classification of cotorsion pairs in acluster category $\mathscr{C}$ of type $A^\infty_\infty$ via certainconfigurations of arcs, called $\tau$-compact Ptolemy diagrams, in an infinitestrip with marked points. As applications, we classify $t$-structures andfunctorially finite rigid subcategories in $\mathscr{C}$, respectively. We alsodeduce Liu-Paquette's classification of cluster tilting categories of$\mathscr{C}$ and Ng's classification of torsion pairs in the cluster categoryof type $A_\infty$.

Ultimate Generalization to Monotonicity for Uniform Convergence of  Trigonometric Series

  Chaundy and Jolliffe [4] proved that if $\{a_{n}\}$ is a non-increasing(monotonic) real sequence with $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_{n}=0$, then anecessary and sufficient condition for the uniform convergence of the series$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\sin nx$ is $ \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}na_{n}=0$. Wegeneralize (or weaken) the monotonic condition on the coefficient sequence$\{a_{n}\}$ in this classical result to the so-called mean value boundedvariation condition and prove that the generalized condition cannot be weakenedfurther. We also establish an analogue to the generalized Chaundy and Jolliffetheorem in the complex space.

Scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation in DFS blocks

  We investigate how to concatenate different decoherence-free subspaces (DFSs)to realize scalable universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. Based ontunable $XXZ$ interactions, we present an architecture for scalable quantumcomputers which can fault-tolerantly perform universal quantum computation bymanipulating only single type of parameter. By using the concept ofinteraction-free subspaces we eliminate the need to tune the couplings betweenlogical qubits, which further reduces the technical difficulties forimplementing quantum computation.

A Visual Attention Grounding Neural Model for Multimodal Machine  Translation

  We introduce a novel multimodal machine translation model that utilizesparallel visual and textual information. Our model jointly optimizes thelearning of a shared visual-language embedding and a translator. The modelleverages a visual attention grounding mechanism that links the visualsemantics with the corresponding textual semantics. Our approach achievescompetitive state-of-the-art results on the Multi30K and the Ambiguous COCOdatasets. We also collected a new multilingual multimodal product descriptiondataset to simulate a real-world international online shopping scenario. Onthis dataset, our visual attention grounding model outperforms other methods bya large margin.

Designing the unambiguous discriminator from the one -photon  interferometer

  In this paper, we shall show that the question of quanum state unambiguousdiscrimination can be solved by reducing it to the known problem of quantumstates filtering.

Rethinking Diversified and Discriminative Proposal Generation for Visual  Grounding

  Visual grounding aims to localize an object in an image referred to by atextual query phrase. Various visual grounding approaches have been proposed,and the problem can be modularized into a general framework: proposalgeneration, multi-modal feature representation, and proposal ranking. Of thesethree modules, most existing approaches focus on the latter two, with theimportance of proposal generation generally neglected. In this paper, werethink the problem of what properties make a good proposal generator. Weintroduce the diversity and discrimination simultaneously when generatingproposals, and in doing so propose Diversified and Discriminative ProposalNetworks model (DDPN). Based on the proposals generated by DDPN, we propose ahigh performance baseline model for visual grounding and evaluate it on fourbenchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model deliverssignificant improvements on all the tested data-sets (e.g., 18.8\% improvementon ReferItGame and 8.2\% improvement on Flickr30k Entities over the existingstate-of-the-arts respectively)

Decorated marked surfaces III: The derived category of a decorated  marked surface

  We study the Ginzburg dg algebra $\Gamma_\mathbf{T}$ associated to the quiverwith potential arising from a triangulation $\mathbf{T}$ of a decorated markedsurface $\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup$, in the sense of Qiu. We show that there isa canonical way to identify all finite dimensional derived categories$\mathcal{D}_{fd}(\Gamma_\mathbf{T})$, denoted by$\mathcal{D}_{fd}(\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup)$. As an application, we show thatthe spherical twist group $\operatorname{ST}(\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup)$associated to $\mathcal{D}_{fd}(\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup)$ acts faithfully onits space of stability conditions.

On $q$-ratio CMSV for sparse recovery

  Sparse recovery aims to reconstruct an unknown spare or approximately sparsesignal from significantly few noisy incoherent linear measurements. As a kindof computable incoherence measure of the measurement matrix, $q$-ratioconstrained minimal singular values (CMSV) was proposed in Zhou and Yu\cite{zhou2018sparse} to derive the performance bounds for sparse recovery. Inthis paper, we study the geometrical property of the $q$-ratio CMSV, based onwhich we establish new sufficient conditions for signal recovery involving bothsparsity defect and measurement error. The $\ell_1$-truncated set $q$-width ofthe measurement matrix is developed as the geometrical characterization of$q$-ratio CMSV. In addition, we show that the $q$-ratio CMSVs of a class ofstructured random matrices are bounded away from zero with high probability aslong as the number of measurements is large enough, therefore satisfy thoseestablished sufficient conditions. Overall, our results generalize the resultsin Zhang and Cheng \cite{zc} from $q=2$ to any $q\in(1,\infty]$ and complementthe arguments of $q$-ratio CMSV from a geometrical view.

Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling with Co-Attention Learning for  Visual Question Answering

  Visual question answering (VQA) is challenging because it requires asimultaneous understanding of both the visual content of images and the textualcontent of questions. The approaches used to represent the images and questionsin a fine-grained manner and questions and to fuse these multi-modal featuresplay key roles in performance. Bilinear pooling based models have been shown tooutperform traditional linear models for VQA, but their high-dimensionalrepresentations and high computational complexity may seriously limit theirapplicability in practice. For multi-modal feature fusion, here we develop aMulti-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling approach to efficiently andeffectively combine multi-modal features, which results in superior performancefor VQA compared with other bilinear pooling approaches. For fine-grained imageand question representation, we develop a co-attention mechanism using anend-to-end deep network architecture to jointly learn both the image andquestion attentions. Combining the proposed MFB approach with co-attentionlearning in a new network architecture provides a unified model for VQA. Ourexperimental results demonstrate that the single MFB with co-attention modelachieves new state-of-the-art performance on the real-world VQA dataset.

The Triality of Conformal Extensions of Three Kinds of Special  Relativity

  The conformal extensions of three kinds of special relativity withISO(1,3)/SO(1,4)/SO(2,3) invariance on Mink/dS/AdS space, respectively, arerealized on an SO(2,4)/Z_2 invariant projective null cone [N] as the(projective) boundary of the 5-d AdS-space. The relations among the conformalMink/dS/AdS spaces, the motions of light signals and the conformal fieldtheories on them can be given. Thus, there should be a triality for theseconformal issues and the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence.

SUMO Substrates and Sites Prediction Combining Pattern Recognition and  Phylogenetic Conservation

  Small Ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) proteins are widely expressed ineukaryotic cells, which are reversibly coupled to their substrates by motifrecognition, called sumoylation. Two interesting questions are 1) how manypotential SUMO substrates may be included in mammalian proteomes, such as humanand mouse, 2) and given a SUMO substrate, can we recognize its sumoylationsites? To answer these two questions, previous prediction systems of SUMOsubstrates mainly adopted the pattern recognition methods, which could get highsensitivity with relatively too many potential false positives. So we usephylogenetic conservation between mouse and human to reduce the number ofpotential false positives.

Idealization Second Quantization of Composite Particles

  A practical method is developed to deal with the second quantization of themany-body system containing the composite particles. In our treatment, themodes associated with composite particles are regarded approximately asindependent ones compared with those of unbound particles. The field operatorsof the composite particles thus arise naturally in the second quantizationHamiltonian. To be emphasized, the second quantization Hamiltonian has theregular structures which correspond clearly to different physical processes.

Flavor SU(3) analysis of charmless B->PP decays

  We perform a global fits to charmless $B \to PP$ decays which independentlyconstrain the $(\bar\rho,\bar\eta)$ vertex of the unitarity triangle. Thefitted amplitudes and phase are used to predict the branching ratios and CPasymmetries of all decay modes, including those of the $B_s$ system. Differentschemes of SU(3) breaking in decay amplitude sizes are analyzed. Thepossibility of having a new physics contribution to $K \pi$ decays is alsodiscussed.

Entanglement generation in double-$Λ$ system

  In this paper, we study the generation of entanglement in a double-$\Lambda $system. Employing standard method of laser theory, we deduce the dynamicevolution equation of the two-mode field. We analyze the available entanglementcriterion for double-$\Lambda $ system and the condition of entanglementexistence. Our results show that under proper parameters, the two-mode fieldcan entangled and amlified.

$Δ$ contribution in $e^+ + e^- \to p + \bar{p}$ at small $s$

  Two-photon annihilate contributions in the process $e^+ + e^- \to p +\bar{p}$ including $N$ and $\Delta$ intermediate are discussed in a simplehadronic model. The corrections to the unpolarized cross section and polarizedobservables $P_x,P_z$ are presented. The results show the two-photon annihilatecorrection to unpolarized cross section is small and its angle dependencebecomes weak at small $s$ after considering the $N$ and $\Delta(1232)$contributions simultaneously, while the correction to $P_z$ is enhanced.

Feature Sampling Strategies for Action Recognition

  Although dense local spatial-temporal features with bag-of-featuresrepresentation achieve state-of-the-art performance for action recognition, thehuge feature number and feature size prevent current methods from scaling up toreal size problems. In this work, we investigate different types of featuresampling strategies for action recognition, namely dense sampling, uniformlyrandom sampling and selective sampling. We propose two effective selectivesampling methods using object proposal techniques. Experiments conducted on alarge video dataset show that we are able to achieve better average recognitionaccuracy using 25% less features, through one of proposed selective samplingmethods, and even remain comparable accuracy while discarding 70% features.

Itcan perform many test contents with large capacity and high level ofautomation, and the migration from one testing configuration to another islightweight and time-saving. This system has been used in the construction ofthe Plastic Scintillator Detector of DArk Matter Particle Explorer already, anda total of 570 Hamamatsu R4443 tubes have been tested successfully.

A Prefixed-Itemset-Based Improvement For Apriori Algorithm

  Association rules is a very important part of data mining. It is used to findthe interesting patterns from transaction databases. Apriori algorithm is oneof the most classical algorithms of association rules, but it has thebottleneck in efficiency. In this article, we proposed a prefixed-itemset-baseddata structure for candidate itemset generation, with the help of the structurewe managed to improve the efficiency of the classical Apriori algorithm.

Design of a large dynamic range readout unit for the PSD detector of  DAMPE

  A large dynamic range is required by the Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD)of DArk Matter Paricle Explorer (DAMPE), and a double-dynode readout has beendeveloped. To verify this design, a prototype detector module has beenconstructed and tested with cosmic rays and heavy ion beams. The results matchwith the estimation and the readout unit could easily cover the requireddynamic range.

Occupation times of general Lévy processes

  For an arbitrary L\'evy process $X$ which is not a compound Poisson process,we are interested in its occupation times. We use a quite novel and usefulapproach to derive formulas for the Laplace transform of the joint distributionof $X$ and its occupation times. Our formulas are compact, and moreimportantly, the forms of the formulas clearly demonstrate the essentialquantities for the calculation of occupation times of $X$. It is believed thatour results are important not only for the study of stochastic processes, butalso for financial applications.

Estimation of block sparsity in compressive sensing

  In this paper, we consider a soft measure of block sparsity,$k_\alpha(\mathbf{x})=\left(\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert_{2,\alpha}/\lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert_{2,1}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}},\alpha\in[0,\infty]$and propose a procedure to estimate it by using multivariate isotropicsymmetric $\alpha$-stable random projections without sparsity or block sparsityassumptions. The limiting distribution of the estimator is given. Somesimulations are conducted to illustrate our theoretical results.

Stable and robust $\ell_p$-constrained compressive sensing recovery via  robust width property

  We study the recovery results of $\ell_p$-constrained compressive sensing(CS) with $p\geq 1$ via robust width property and determine conditions on thenumber of measurements for standard Gaussian matrices under which the propertyholds with high probability. Our paper extends the existing results in Cahilland Mixon (2014) from $\ell_2$-constrained CS to $\ell_p$-constrained case with$p\geq 1$ and complements the recovery analysis for robust CS with $\ell_p$loss function.

Phaseless compressive sensing using partial support information

  We study the recovery conditions of weighted $\ell_1$ minimization forreal-valued signal reconstruction from phaseless compressive sensingmeasurements when partial support information is available. A strong restrictedisometry property condition is provided to ensure the stable recovery.Moreover, we present the weighted null space property as the sufficient andnecessary condition for the success of $k$-sparse phaseless recovery viaweighted $\ell_1$ minimization. Numerical experiments are conducted toillustrate our results.

Recovery analysis for weighted mixed $\ell_2/\ell_p$ minimization with  $0<p\leq 1$

  We study the recovery conditions of weighted mixed $\ell_2/\ell_p\,(0<p\leq1)$ minimization for block sparse signal reconstruction from compressedmeasurements when partial block support information is available. We show thatthe block $p$-restricted isometry property (RIP) can ensure the robustrecovery. Moreover, we present the sufficient and necessary condition for therecovery by using weighted block $p$-null space property. The relationshipbetween the block $p$-RIP and the weighted block $p$-null space property hasbeen established. Finally, we illustrate our results with a series of numericalexperiments.

Sparse recovery based on q-ratio constrained minimal singular values

  We study verifiable sufficient conditions and computable performance boundsfor sparse recovery algorithms such as the Basis Pursuit, the Dantzig selectorand the Lasso estimator, in terms of a newly defined family of quality measuresfor the measurement matrices. With high probability, the developed measures forsubgaussian random matrices are bounded away from zero as long as the number ofmeasurements is reasonably large. Comparing to the restricted isotropicconstant based performance analysis, the arguments in this paper are much moreconcise and the obtained bounds are tighter. Numerical experiments arepresented to illustrate our theoretical results.

Coupling Techniques for Reasoning about Quantum Programs

  Relational verification of quantum programs has many potential applicationsin security and other domains. We propose a relational program logic forquantum programs. The interpretation of our logic is based on a quantumanalogue of probabilistic couplings. We use our logic to verify non-trivialrelational properties of quantum programs, including uniformity for samplesgenerated by the quantum Bernoulli factory, reliability of quantumteleportation against noise (bit and phase flip), and equivalence of quantumrandom walks.

Towards Efficient and Unbiased Implementation of Lipschitz Continuity in  GANs

  Lipschitz continuity recently becomes popular in generative adversarialnetworks (GANs). It was observed that the Lipschitz regularized discriminatorleads to improved training stability and sample quality. The mainstreamimplementations of Lipschitz continuity include gradient penalty and spectralnormalization. In this paper, we demonstrate that gradient penalty introducesundesired bias, while spectral normalization might be over restrictive. Weaccordingly propose a new method which is efficient and unbiased. Ourexperiments verify our analysis and show that the proposed method is able toachieve successful training in various situations where gradient penalty andspectral normalization fail.

Common Electronic Origin of Superconductivity in (Li,Fe)OHFeSe Bulk  Superconductor and Single-Layer FeSe/SrTiO3 Films

  The mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in the iron-basedsuperconductors remains an outstanding issue in condensed matter physics. Theelectronic structure, in particular the Fermi surface topology, is consideredto play an essential role in dictating the superconductivity. Recent revelationof distinct electronic structure and possible high temperaturesuperconductivity with a transition temperature Tc above 65 K in thesingle-layer FeSe films grown on the SrTiO3 substrate provides key informationon the roles of Fermi surface topology and interface in inducing or enhancingsuperconductivity. Here we report high resolution angle-resolved photoemissionmeasurement on the electronic structure and superconducting gap of a novelFeSe-based superconductor, (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se, with a Tc at 41 K. We findthat this single-phase bulk superconductor shows remarkably similar electronicbehaviors to that of the superconducting single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film in termsof Fermi surface topology, band structure and nearly isotropic superconductinggap without nodes. These observations provide significant insights inunderstanding high temperature superconductivity in the single-layerFeSe/SrTiO3 film in particular, and the mechanism of superconductivity in theiron-based superconductors in general.

Binary nonlinearization of the super AKNS system

  We establish the binary nonlinearization approach of the spectral problem ofthe super AKNS system, and then use it to obtain the super finite-dimensionalintegrable Hamiltonian system in supersymmetry manifold $\mathbb{R}^{4N|2N}$.The super Hamiltonian forms and integrals of motion are given explicitly.

Global Asymptotics of the Discrete Chebyshev Polynomials

  In this paper, we study the asymptotics of the discrete Chebyshev polynomialstn (z, N) as the degree grows to infinity. Global asymptotic formulas areobtained as n \rightarrow \infty, when the ratio of the parameters n/N = c is aconstant in the interval (0, 1). Our method is based on a modified version ofthe Riemann-Hilbert approach first introduced by Deift and Zhou.

On local property of absolute summability of factored Fourier series

  We establish two general theorems on the local properties of the absolutesummability of factored Fourier series by applying a recently defined absolutesummability, $\left\vert A,\alpha_{n}\right\vert _{k}$ summability, and theclass $\mathcal{S}\left( \alpha_{n},\phi_{n}\right) $, which generalize somewell known results and can be applied to improve many classical absolutesummability methods.

Comment on "Localization of 5D Elko Spinors on Minkowski Branes"

  We show that the statement in Yu-Xiao Liu, Xiang-Nan Zhou, Ke Yang andFeng-Wei Chen [Phys. Rev. D 86 , 064012 (2012)] that the zero mode of ELKOspinor is localized in some thin brane scenarios is not correct. This reopensthe problem of localization of ELKO spinors.
