The QBF Gallery: Behind the Scenes

  Over the last few years, much progress has been made in the theory andpractice of solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Novel solvers have beenpresented that either successfully enhance established techniques or implementnovel solving paradigms. Powerful preprocessors have been realized that tunethe encoding of a formula to make it easier to solve. Frameworks forcertification and solution extraction emerged that allow for a detailedinterpretation of a QBF solver's results, and new types of QBF encodings werepresented for various application problems.  To capture these developments the QBF Gallery was established in 2013. TheQBF Gallery aims at providing a forum to assess QBF tools and to collect new,expressive benchmarks that allow for documenting the status quo and thatindicate promising research directions. These benchmarks became the basis forthe experiments conducted in the context of the QBF Gallery 2013 and follow-upevaluations. In this paper, we report on the setup of the QBF Gallery. To thisend, we conducted numerous experiments which allowed us not only to assess thequality of the tools, but also the quality of the benchmarks.
