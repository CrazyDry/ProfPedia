Simulating Special but Natural Quantum Circuits

  We identify a sub-class of BQP that captures certain structural commonalitiesamong many quantum algorithms including Shor's algorithms. This class does notcontain all of BQP (e.g. Grover's algorithm does not fall into this class). Ourmain result is that any algorithm in this class that measures at most O(log n)qubits can be simulated by classical randomized polynomial time algorithms.This does not dequantize Shor's algorithm (as the latter measures n qubits) butour work also highlights a new potentially hard function for cryptographicapplications.  Our main technical contribution is (to the best of our knowledge) a new exactcharacterization of certain sums of Fourier-type coefficients (withexponentially many summands).

Polynomials Modulo Composite Numbers: Ax-Katz type theorems for the  structure of their solution sets

  We extend the Ax-Katz theorem for a single polynomial from finite fields tothe rings Z_m with m composite. This extension not only yields the analogousresult, but gives significantly higher divisibility bounds. We conjecture whatcomputer runs suggest is the optimal result for any m, and prove a special caseof it. The special case is for m = 2^r and polynomials of degree 2. Our resultsalso yield further properties of the solution spaces. Polynomials modulocomposites are the focus of some computational complexity lower boundfrontiers, while those modulo 2^r arise in the simulation of quantum circuits.We give some prospective applications of this research.

Stabilizer Circuits, Quadratic Forms, and Computing Matrix Rank

  We show that a form of strong simulation for $n$-qubit quantum stabilizercircuits $C$ is computable in $O(s + n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega$ is theexponent of matrix multiplication. Solution counting for quadratic forms over$\mathbb{F}_2$ is also placed into $O(n^\omega)$ time. This improves previous$O(n^3)$ bounds. Our methods in fact show an $O(n^2)$-time reduction frommatrix rank over $\mathbb{F}_2$ to computing $p = |\langle \; 0^n \;|\; C \;|\;0^n \;\rangle|^2$ (hence also to solution counting) and a converse reductionthat is $O(s + n^2)$ except for matrix multiplications used to decide whether$p > 0$. The current best-known worst-case time for matrix rank is$O(n^{\omega})$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$, indeed over any field, while $\omega$ iscurrently upper-bounded by $2.3728\dots$ Our methods draw on properties ofclassical quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. We study possible distributionsof Feynman paths in the circuits and prove that the differences in $+1$ vs.$-1$ counts and $+i$ vs. $-i$ counts are always $0$ or a power of $2$. Furtherproperties of quantum graph states and connections to graph theory arediscussed.
