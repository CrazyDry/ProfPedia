Simulating Special but Natural Quantum Circuits

  We identify a sub-class of BQP that captures certain structural commonalities
among many quantum algorithms including Shor's algorithms. This class does not
contain all of BQP (e.g. Grover's algorithm does not fall into this class). Our
main result is that any algorithm in this class that measures at most O(log n)
qubits can be simulated by classical randomized polynomial time algorithms.
This does not dequantize Shor's algorithm (as the latter measures n qubits) but
our work also highlights a new potentially hard function for cryptographic
applications.
  Our main technical contribution is (to the best of our knowledge) a new exact
characterization of certain sums of Fourier-type coefficients (with
exponentially many summands).


Polynomials Modulo Composite Numbers: Ax-Katz type theorems for the
  structure of their solution sets

  We extend the Ax-Katz theorem for a single polynomial from finite fields to
the rings Z_m with m composite. This extension not only yields the analogous
result, but gives significantly higher divisibility bounds. We conjecture what
computer runs suggest is the optimal result for any m, and prove a special case
of it. The special case is for m = 2^r and polynomials of degree 2. Our results
also yield further properties of the solution spaces. Polynomials modulo
composites are the focus of some computational complexity lower bound
frontiers, while those modulo 2^r arise in the simulation of quantum circuits.
We give some prospective applications of this research.


Stabilizer Circuits, Quadratic Forms, and Computing Matrix Rank

  We show that a form of strong simulation for $n$-qubit quantum stabilizer
circuits $C$ is computable in $O(s + n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega$ is the
exponent of matrix multiplication. Solution counting for quadratic forms over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ is also placed into $O(n^\omega)$ time. This improves previous
$O(n^3)$ bounds. Our methods in fact show an $O(n^2)$-time reduction from
matrix rank over $\mathbb{F}_2$ to computing $p = |\langle \; 0^n \;|\; C \;|\;
0^n \;\rangle|^2$ (hence also to solution counting) and a converse reduction
that is $O(s + n^2)$ except for matrix multiplications used to decide whether
$p > 0$. The current best-known worst-case time for matrix rank is
$O(n^{\omega})$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$, indeed over any field, while $\omega$ is
currently upper-bounded by $2.3728\dots$ Our methods draw on properties of
classical quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. We study possible distributions
of Feynman paths in the circuits and prove that the differences in $+1$ vs.
$-1$ counts and $+i$ vs. $-i$ counts are always $0$ or a power of $2$. Further
properties of quantum graph states and connections to graph theory are
discussed.
