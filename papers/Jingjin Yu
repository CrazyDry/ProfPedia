Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Graphs: Structure and Computational  Complexity

  We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs (MPP)over four distinct minimization objectives: the total arrival time, themakespan (last arrival time), the total distance, and the maximum (single-robottraveled) distance. On the structure side, we show that each pair of these fourobjectives induces a Pareto front and cannot always be optimizedsimultaneously. Then, through reductions from 3-SAT, we further establish thatcomputation over each objective is an NP-hard task, providing evidence thatsolving MPP optimally is generally intractable. Nevertheless, in a relatedpaper, we design complete algorithms and efficient heuristics for optimizingall four objectives, capable of solving MPP optimally or near-optimally forhundreds of robots in challenging setups.

Coordinating the Motion of Labeled Discs with Optimality Guarantees  under Extreme Density

  We push the limit in planning collision-free motions for routing uniformlabeled discs in two dimensions. First, from a theoretical perspective, we showthat the constant-factor time-optimal routing of labeled discs can be achievedusing a polynomial-time algorithm with robot density over $50\%$ in the limit(i.e., over half of the workspace may be occupied by the discs). Second, from amore practical standpoint, we provide a high performance algorithm thatcomputes near-optimal (e.g., $1.x$) solutions under the same density setting.

Distance Optimal Formation Control on Graphs with a Tight Convergence  Time Guarantee

  For the task of moving a set of indistinguishable agents on a connected graphwith unit edge distance to an arbitrary set of goal vertices, free ofcollisions, we propose a fast distance optimal control algorithm that guidesthe agents into the desired formation. Moreover, we show that the algorithmalso provides a tight convergence time guarantee (time optimality and distanceoptimality cannot be simultaneously satisfied). Our generic graph formulationallows the algorithm to be applied to scenarios such as grids with holes(modeling obstacles) in arbitrary dimensions. Simulations, available online,confirm our theoretical developments.

Planning Optimal Paths for Multiple Robots on Graphs

  In this paper, we study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning(MPP) on graphs. We propose two multiflow based integer linear programming(ILP) models that computes minimum last arrival time and minimum total distancesolutions for our MPP formulation, respectively. The resulting algorithms fromthese ILP models are complete and guaranteed to yield true optimal solutions.In addition, our flexible framework can easily accommodate other variants ofthe MPP problem. Focusing on the time optimal algorithm, we evaluate itsperformance, both as a stand alone algorithm and as a generic heuristic forquickly solving large problem instances. Computational results confirm theeffectiveness of our method.

Multi-agent Path Planning and Network Flow

  This paper connects multi-agent path planning on graphs (roadmaps) to networkflow problems, showing that the former can be reduced to the latter, thereforeenabling the application of combinatorial network flow algorithms, as well asgeneral linear program techniques, to multi-agent path planning problems ongraphs. Exploiting this connection, we show that when the goals are permutationinvariant, the problem always has a feasible solution path set with a longestfinish time of no more than $n + V - 1$ steps, in which $n$ is the number ofagents and $V$ is the number of vertices of the underlying graph. We then givea complete algorithm that finds such a solution in $O(nVE)$ time, with $E$being the number of edges of the graph. Taking a further step, we study timeand distance optimality of the feasible solutions, show that they have apairwise Pareto optimal structure, and again provide efficient algorithms foroptimizing two of these practical objectives.

Shortest Path Set Induced Vertex Ordering and its Application to  Distributed Distance Optimal Multi-agent Formation Path Planning

  For the task of moving a group of indistinguishable agents on a connectedgraph with unit edge lengths into an arbitrary goal formation, it waspreviously shown that distance optimal paths can be scheduled to complete witha tight convergence time guarantee, using a fully centralized algorithm. Inthis study, we show that the problem formulation in fact induces a morefundamental ordering of the vertices on the underlying graph network, whichdirectly leads to a more intuitive scheduling algorithm that assures the sameconvergence time and runs faster. More importantly, this structure enables adistributed scheduling algorithm once individual paths are assigned to theagents, which was not possible before. The vertex ordering also readily extendsto more general graphs - those with non-unit capacities and edge lengths - forwhich we again guarantee the convergence time until the desired formation isachieved.

Pebble Motion on Graphs with Rotations: Efficient Feasibility Tests and  Planning Algorithms

  We study the problem of planning paths for $p$ distinguishable pebbles(robots) residing on the vertices of an $n$-vertex connected graph with $p \len$. A pebble may move from a vertex to an adjacent one in a time step providedthat it does not collide with other pebbles. When $p = n$, the only collisionfree moves are synchronous rotations of pebbles on disjoint cycles of thegraph. We show that the feasibility of such problems is intrinsicallydetermined by the diameter of a (unique) permutation group induced by theunderlying graph. Roughly speaking, the diameter of a group $\mathbf G$ is theminimum length of the generator product required to reach an arbitrary elementof $\mathbf G$ from the identity element. Through bounding the diameter of thisassociated permutation group, which assumes a maximum value of $O(n^2)$, weestablish a linear time algorithm for deciding the feasibility of such problemsand an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for planning complete paths.

A Linear Time Algorithm for the Feasibility of Pebble Motion on Graphs

  Given a connected, undirected, simple graph $G = (V, E)$ and $p \le |V|$pebbles labeled $1,..., p$, a configuration of these $p$ pebbles is aninjective map assigning the pebbles to vertices of $G$. Let $S$ and $D$ be twosuch configurations. From a configuration, pebbles can move on $G$ as follows:In each step, at most one pebble may move from the vertex it currently occupiesto an adjacent unoccupied vertex, yielding a new configuration. A naturalquestion in this setting is the following: Is configuration $D$ reachable from$S$ and if so, how? We show that the feasibility of this problem can be decidedin time $O(|V| + |E|)$.

Correlated Orienteering Problem and it Application to Persistent  Monitoring Tasks

  We propose a novel non-linear extension to the Orienteering Problem (OP),called the Correlated Orienteering Problem (COP). We use COP to model theplanning of informative tours for the persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporalfield with time-invariant spatial correlations, in which the tours areconstrained to have limited length. Our focus in this paper is QCOP a quadraticCOP formulation that only looks at correlations between neighboring nodes in anode network. The main feature of QCOP is a quadratic utility functioncapturing the said spatial correlation. QCOP may be solved using mixed integerquadratic programming (MIQP), with the resulting anytime algorithm capable ofplanning multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility. Inparticular, our algorithm can quickly plan a near-optimal tour over a networkwith up to $150$ nodes. Besides performing extensive simulation studies toverify the algorithm's correctness and characterize its performance, we alsosuccessfully applied it to two realistic persistent monitoring tasks: (i)estimation over a synthetic spatiotemporal field, and (ii) estimating thetemperature distribution in the state of Massachusetts.

Optimal Tourist Problem and Anytime Planning of Trip Itineraries

  We introduce and study the problem in which a mobile sensing robot (ourtourist) is tasked to travel among and gather intelligence at a set ofspatially distributed point-of-interests (POIs). The quality of the informationcollected at each POI is characterized by some non-decreasing reward functionover the time spent at the POI. With limited time budget, the robot mustbalance between spending time traveling to POIs and spending time at POIs forinformation collection (sensing) so as to maximize the total reward.Alternatively, the robot may be required to acquire a minimum mount of rewardand hopes to do so with the least amount of time. We propose a mixed integerprogramming (MIP) based anytime algorithm for solving these two NP-hardoptimization problems to arbitrary precision. The effectiveness of ouralgorithm is demonstrated using an extensive set of computational experimentsincluding the planning of a realistic itinerary for a first-time tourist inIstanbul.

Intractability of Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Planar Graphs

  We study the computational complexity of optimally solving multi-robot pathplanning problems on planar graphs. For four common time- and distance-basedobjectives, we show that the associated path optimization problems for multiplerobots are all NP-complete, even when the underlying graph is planar.Establishing the computational intractability of optimal multi-robot pathplanning problems on planar graphs has important practical implications. Inparticular, our result suggests the preferred approach toward solving suchproblems, when the number of robots is large, is to augment the planarenvironment to reduce the sharing of paths among robots traveling in oppositedirections on those paths. Indeed, such efficiency boosting structures, such ashighways and elevated intersections, are ubiquitous in robotics andtransportation applications.

An Effective Algorithmic Framework for Near Optimal Multi-Robot Path  Planning

  We present a centralized algorithmic framework for solving multi-robot pathplanning problems in general, two-dimensional, continuous environments whileminimizing globally the task completion time. The framework obtains high levelsof effectiveness through the composition of an optimal discretization of thecontinuous environment and the subsequent fast, near-optimal resolution of theresulting discrete planning problem. This principled approach achieves ordersof magnitudes better performance with respect to both speed and the supportedrobot density. For a wide variety of environments, our method is shown tocompute globally near-optimal solutions for fifty robots in seconds with robotspacked close to each other. In the extreme, the method can consistently solveproblems with hundreds of robots that occupy over 30% of the free space.

Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Graphs: Complete Algorithms and  Effective Heuristics

  We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs MPP overfour distinct minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), themaximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the totaldistance. In a related paper, we show that these objectives are distinct andNP-hard to optimize. In this work, we focus on efficiently algorithmicsolutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we firstestablish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and network-flow. Based onthis equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel andcomplete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. Inparticular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is afirst such that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems withrobot-vertex ratio as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computationalperformance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principledheuristics, at the expense of some optimality loss. The combination of ILPmodel based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective,allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containinghundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in justseconds.

  microMVP is an affordable, portable, and open source micro-scale mobile robotplatform designed for robotics research and education. As a complete and uniquemulti-vehicle platform enabled by 3D printing and the maker culture, microMVPcan be easily reproduced and requires little maintenance: a set of six microvehicles, each measuring $8\times 5\times 6$ cubic centimeters and weighingunder $100$ grams, and the accompanying tracking platform can be fullyassembled in under two hours, all from readily available components. In thispaper, we describe microMVP's hardware and software architecture, and thedesign thoughts that go into the making of the platform. The capabilities ofmicroMVP APIs are then demonstrated with several single- and multi-robot pathand motion planning algorithms. microMVP supports all common operation systems.

Average Case Constant Factor Time and Distance Optimal Multi-Robot Path  Planning in Well-Connected Environments

  Fast algorithms for optimal multi-robot path planning are sought after inmany real-world applications. Known methods, however, generally do notsimultaneously guarantee good solution optimality and fast run time (e.g.,polynomial). In this work, we develop a low-polynomial running time algorithm,called SplitAndGroup (SAG),that solves the multi-robot path planning problem ongrids and grid-like environments and produces constant factor makespan-optimalsolutions in the average case. That is, SAG is an average caseO(1)-approximation algorithm. SAG computes solutions with sub-linear makespanand is capable of handling cases when the density of robots is extremely high -in a graph-theoretic setting, the algorithm supports cases where all verticesof the underlying graph are occupied by robots. SAG attains its desirableproperties through a careful combination of divide-and-conquer technique andnetwork flow based methods for routing the robots. Solutions from SAG, in aweaker sense, is also a constant factor approximation on total distanceoptimality.

Target Assignment in Robotic Networks: Distance Optimality Guarantees  and Hierarchical Strategies

  We study the problem of multi-robot target assignment to minimize the totaldistance traveled by the robots until they all reach an equal number of statictargets. In the first half of the paper, we present a necessary and sufficientcondition under which true distance optimality can be achieved for robots withlimited communication and target-sensing ranges. Moreover, we provide anexplicit, non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed toachieve distance optimality in terms of the robots' communication andtarget-sensing ranges with arbitrary guaranteed probabilities. The same boundsare also shown to be asymptotically tight.  In the second half of the paper, we present suboptimal strategies for usewhen the number of robots cannot be chosen freely. Assuming first that alltargets are known to all robots, we employ a hierarchical communication modelin which robots communicate only with other robots in the same partitionedregion. This hierarchical communication model leads to constant approximationsof true distance-optimal solutions under mild assumptions. We then revisit thelimited communication and sensing models. By combining simple rendezvous-basedstrategies with a hierarchical communication model, we obtain decentralizedhierarchical strategies that achieve constant approximation ratios with respectto true distance optimality. Results of simulation show that the approximationratio is as low as 1.4.

High-Quality Tabletop Rearrangement with Overhand Grasps: Hardness  Results and Fast Methods

  This paper studies the underlying combinatorial structure of a class ofobject rearrangement problems, which appear frequently in applications. Theproblems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat,horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and performpick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the casewhere the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. Foroverlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number ofpick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by theend-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimizethe end-effector distance. While such problems do not involve all thecomplexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hardchallenges in both cases. This is shown through two-way reductions betweenwell-understood, hard combinatorial challenges and these rearrangementproblems. The benefit of the reduction is that there are well studiedalgorithms for solving these well-established combinatorial challenges. Thesealgorithms can be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. Thepaper builds on these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline fordealing with the rearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation shows that theproposed pipeline achieves high-quality paths with regards to the optimizationobjectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highly desirable scalability as the numberof objects increases in both the overlapping and non-overlapping setups.

Constant Factor Time Optimal Multi-Robot Routing on High-Dimensional  Grids in Mostly Sub-Quadratic Time

  Let $G = (V, E)$ be an $m_1 \times \ldots \times m_k$ grid. Assuming thateach $v \in V$ is occupied by a robot and a robot may move to a neighboringvertex in a step via synchronized rotations along cycles of $G$, we firstestablish that the arbitrary reconfiguration of labeled robots on $G$ can beperformed in $O(k\sum_i m_i)$ makespan and requires $O(|V|^2)$ running time inthe worst case and $o(|V|^2)$ when $G$ is non-degenerate (in the currentcontext, a grid is degenerate if it is nearly one dimensional). The resultingalgorithm, iSAG, provides average case $O(1)$-approximate (i.e.,constant-factor) time optimality guarantee. When all dimensions are of similarsize $O(|V|^{\frac{1}{k}})$, the running time of iSAG approaches a linear$O(|V|)$. Define $d_g(p)$ as the largest distance between individual initialand goal configurations over all robots for a given problem instance $p$,building on iSAG, we develop the PartitionAndFlow (PAF) algorithm that computes$O(d_g(p))$ makespan solutions for arbitrary fixed $k \ge 2$, using mostly$o(|V|^2)$ running time. PAF provides worst case $O(1)$-approximation regardingsolution time optimality. We note that the worst case running time for theproblem is $\Omega(|V|^2)$.

Persistent Monitoring of Events with Stochastic Arrivals at Multiple  Stations

  This paper introduces a new mobile sensor scheduling problem, involving asingle robot tasked with monitoring several events of interest that occur atdifferent locations. Of particular interest is the monitoring of transientevents that can not be easily forecast. Application areas range from naturalphenomena ({\em e.g.}, monitoring abnormal seismic activity around a volcanousing a ground robot) to urban activities ({\em e.g.}, monitoring earlyformations of traffic congestion using an aerial robot). Motivated by those andmany other examples, this paper focuses on problems in which the preciseoccurrence times of the events are unknown {\em a priori}, but statistics fortheir inter-arrival times are available. The robot's task is to monitor theevents to optimize the following two objectives: {\em (i)} maximize the numberof events observed and {\em (ii)} minimize the delay between two consecutiveobservations of events occurring at the same location. The paper considers thecase when a robot is tasked with optimizing the event observations in abalanced manner, following a cyclic patrolling route. First, assuming thecyclic ordering of stations is known, we prove the existence and uniqueness ofthe optimal solution, and show that the optimal solution has desirableconvergence and robustness properties. Our constructive proof also produces anefficient algorithm for computing the unique optimal solution with $O(n)$ timecomplexity, in which $n$ is the number of stations, with $O(\log n)$ timecomplexity for incrementally adding or removing stations. Except for thealgorithm, most of the analysis remains valid when the cyclic order is unknown.We then provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme that gives a$(1+\epsilon)$-optimal solution for this more general, NP-hard problem.

Motion Planning for Unlabeled Discs with Optimality Guarantees

  We study the problem of path planning for unlabeled (indistinguishable)unit-disc robots in a planar environment cluttered with polygonal obstacles. Weintroduce an algorithm which minimizes the total path length, i.e., the sum oflengths of the individual paths. Our algorithm is guaranteed to find a solutionif one exists, or report that none exists otherwise. It runs in time$\tilde{O}(m^4+m^2n^2)$, where $m$ is the number of robots and $n$ is the totalcomplexity of the workspace. Moreover, the total length of the returnedsolution is at most $\text{OPT}+4m$, where OPT is the optimal solution cost. Tothe best of our knowledge this is the first algorithm for the problem that hassuch guarantees. The algorithm has been implemented in an exact manner and wepresent experimental results that attest to its efficiency.

Efficient, High-Quality Stack Rearrangement

  This work studies rearrangement problems involving the sorting of robots orobjects in stack-like containers, which can be accessed only from one side. Twoscenarios are considered: one where every robot or object needs to reach aparticular stack, and a setting in which each robot has a distinct positionwithin a stack. In both cases, the goal is to minimize the number of stackremovals that need to be performed. Stack rearrangement is shown to beintimately connected to pebble motion problems, a useful abstraction inmulti-robot path planning. Through this connection, feasibility of stackrearrangement can be readily addressed. The paper continues to establish lowerand upper bounds on optimality, which differ only by a logarithmic factor, interms of stack removals. An algorithmic solution is then developed thatproduces suboptimal paths much quicker than a pebble motion solver.Furthermore, informed search-based methods are proposed for findinghigh-quality solutions. The efficiency and desirable scalability of the methodsis demonstrated in simulation.

SEAR: A Polynomial-Time Multi-Robot Path Planning Algorithm with  Expected Constant-Factor Optimality Guarantee

  We study the labeled multi-robot path planning problem in continuous 2D and3D domains in the absence of obstacles where robots must not collide with eachother. For an arbitrary number of robots in arbitrary initial and goalarrangements, we derive a polynomial time, complete algorithm that producessolutions with constant-factor optimality guarantees on both makespan anddistance optimality, in expectation, under the assumption that the robot labelsare uniformly randomly distributed. Our algorithm only requires a smallconstant factor expansion of the initial and goal configuration footprints forsolving the problem, i.e., the problem can be solved in a fairly small boundedregion. Beside theoretical guarantees, we present a thorough computationalevaluation of the proposed solution. In addition to the baselineimplementation, adapting an effective (but non-polynomial time) routingsubroutine, we also provide a highly efficient implementation that quicklycomputes near-optimal solutions. Hardware experiments on the microMVP platformcomposed of non-holonomic robots confirms the practical applicability of ouralgorithmic pipeline.

Fast, High-Quality Dual-Arm Rearrangement in Synchronous, Monotone  Tabletop Setups

  Rearranging objects on a planar surface arises in a variety of roboticapplications, such as product packaging. Using two arms can improve efficiencybut introduces new computational challenges. This paper studies the structureof dual-arm rearrangement for synchronous, monotone tabletop setups anddevelops an optimal mixed integer model. It then describes an efficient andscalable algorithm, which first minimizes the cost of object transfers and thenof moves between objects. This is motivated by the fact that, asymptotically,object transfers dominate the cost of solutions. Moreover, a lazy strategyminimizes the number of motion planning calls and results in significantspeedups. Theoretical arguments support the benefits of using two arms andindicate that synchronous execution, in which the two arms perform togethereither transfers or moves, introduces only a small overhead. Experimentssupport these points and show that the scalable method can quickly computesolutions close to the optimal for the considered setup.

Integer Programming as a General Solution Methodology for Path-Based  Optimization in Robotics: Principles, Best Practices, and Applications

  Integer programming (IP) has proven to be highly effective in solving manypath-based optimization problems in robotics. However, the applications of IPare generally done in an ad-hoc, problem specific manner. In this work, afterexamined a wide range of path-based optimization problems, we describe an IPsolution methodology for these problems that is both easy to apply (in twosimple steps) and high-performance in terms of the computation time and theachieved optimality. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through theapplication to three challenging path-based optimization problems: multi-robotpath planning (MPP), minimum constraint removal (MCR), and reward collectionproblems RCPs). Associated experiments show that the approach can efficientlyproduce (near-)optimal solutions for problems with large state spaces, complexconstraints, and complicated objective functions. In conjunction with theproposition of the IP methodology, we introduce two new and practical roboticsproblems: multi-robot minimum constraint removal (MMCR) and multi-robot pathplanning (MPP) with partial solutions, which can be quickly and effectivelysolved using our proposed IP solution pipeline.

DDM*: Fast Near-Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning using Diversified-Path  and Optimal Sub-Problem Solution Database Heuristics

  We propose a novel centralized and decoupled algorithm, DDM*, for solvingone-shot and dynamic optimal multi-robot path planning problems in agraph-based setting. Among other techniques, DDM* is mainly enabled throughexploiting two innovative heuristics: path diversification and optimalsub-problem solution databases. The two heuristics attack two distinct phasesof a decoupling-based planner: while path diversification allows more effectiveuse of the entire workspace for robot travel, optimal sub-problem solutiondatabases facilitate the fast resolution of local path conflicts. Extensiveevaluation demonstrates that DDM* achieves both great scalability and a highlevel of solution optimality.

Asset Allocation and Risk Assessment with Gross Exposure Constraints for  Vast Portfolios

  Markowitz (1952, 1959) laid down the ground-breaking work on themean-variance analysis. Under his framework, the theoretical optimal allocationvector can be very different from the estimated one for large portfolios due tothe intrinsic difficulty of estimating a vast covariance matrix and returnvector. This can result in adverse performance in portfolio selected based onempirical data due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We address thisproblem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolioselection. We show that with gross-exposure constraint the theoretical optimalportfolios have similar performance to the empirically selected ones based onestimated covariance matrices and there is no error accumulation effect fromestimation of vast covariance matrices. This gives theoretical justification tothe empirical results in Jagannathan and Ma (2003). We also show that theno-short-sale portfolio is not diversified enough and can be improved byallowing some short positions. As the constraint on short sales relaxes, thenumber of selected assets varies from a small number to the total number ofstocks, when tracking portfolios or selecting assets. This achieves the optimalsparse portfolio selection, which has close performance to the theoreticaloptimal one. Among 1000 stocks, for example, we are able to identify alloptimal subsets of portfolios of different sizes, their associated allocationvectors, and their estimated risks. The utility of our new approach isillustrated by simulation and empirical studies on the 100 Fama-Frenchindustrial portfolios and the 400 stocks randomly selected from Russell 3000.

Towards Robust Product Packing with a Minimalistic End-Effector

  Advances in sensor technologies, object detection algorithms, planningframeworks and hardware designs have motivated the deployment of robots inwarehouse automation. A variety of such applications, like order fulfillment orpacking tasks, require picking objects from unstructured piles and carefullyarranging them in bins or containers. Desirable solutions need to be low-cost,easily deployable and controllable, making minimalistic hardware choicesdesirable. The challenge in designing an effective solution to this problemrelates to appropriately integrating multiple components, so as to achieve arobust pipeline that minimizes failure conditions. The current work proposes acomplete pipeline for solving such packing tasks, given access only to RGB-Ddata and a single robot arm with a vacuum-based end-effector, which is alsoused as a pushing finger. To achieve the desired level of robustness, three keymanipulation primitives are identified, which take advantage of the environmentand simple operations to successfully pack multiple cubic objects. The overallapproach is demonstrated to be robust to execution and perception errors. Theimpact of each manipulation primitive is evaluated by considering differentversions of the proposed pipeline, which incrementally introduce reasoningabout object poses and corrective manipulation actions.
