The XX-model with boundaries. Part II: Finite size scaling and partition  functions

  We compute the continuum limit of the spectra for the XX-model with arbitrarycomplex boundary fields. In the case of hermitian boundary terms one obtainsthe partition functions of the free compactified boson field on a cylinder withNeumann-Neumann, Dirichlet-Neumann or Dirichlet-Dirichlet boundary conditions.This applies also for certain non-hermitian boundaries. For special cases wealso compute the free surface energy. For certain non-hermitian boundary termsthe results are more complex.Here one obtains logarithmic corrections to thefree surface energy. The asymmetric version of the XX-model with boundaries(this includes the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction)is also discussed.

The Jordan lattice completion and a note on injective envelopes and von  Neumann algebras

  The article associates two fundamental lattice constructions with eachregular unital real ordered Banach space (function system). These are used toestablish certain results in the theory of operator algebras, specificallyrelating the injective envelope of a separable C*-algebra with its envelopingvon Neumann algebra in a given faithful separable representation. The lastsection investigates on lattices of projections arising in injectiveC*-algebras and von Neumann algebras and certain nonlinear maps sendingprojections to projections which are essentially determined by their values onpositive projections.

Moduli Stacks of Vector Bundles and Frobenius Morphisms

  We describe the action of the different Frobenius morphisms on the cohomologyring of the moduli stack of algebraic vector bundles of fixed rank anddeterminant on an algebraic curve over a finite field in characteristic p andanalyse special situations like vector bundles on the projective line andrelations with infinite Grassmannians.

A note on injective envelopes and von Neumann algebras

  The article exhibits certain relations between the injective envelope I(A) ofa C*-algebra A and the von Neumann algebra generated by a representation lambdaof A provided it is injective. More specifically we show that there existpositive retractions sigma : /lambda (A)'' ---> I(A) which are close to being*-homomorphisms in the sense that they are Jordan homomorphisms of theunderlying Jordan algebras, and the kernel of /sigma is given by a twosidedideal.

Local transport measurements on epitaxial graphene

  Growth of large-scale graphene is still accompanied by imperfections. Bymeans of a four-tip STM/SEM the local structure of graphene grown on SiC(0001)was correlated with scanning electron microscope images and spatially resolvedtransport measurements. The systematic variation of probe spacings andsubstrate temperature has clearly revealed two-dimensional transport regimes ofAnderson localization as well as of diffusive transport. The detailed analysisof the temperature dependent data demonstrates that the local on-top nano-sizedcontacts do not induce significant strain to the epitaxial graphene films.

Hypercontractivity of heat semigroups on free quantum groups

  In this paper we study two semigroups of completely positive unitalself-adjoint maps on the von Neumann algebras of the free orthogonal quantumgroup $O_N^+$ and the free permutation quantum group $S_N^+$. We show thatthese semigroups satisfy ultracontractivity and hypercontractivity estimates.We also give results regarding spectral gap and logarithmic Sobolevinequalities.

Efficiency of different numerical methods for solving Redfield equations

  The numerical efficiency of different schemes for solving the Liouville-vonNeumann equation within multilevel Redfield theory has been studied. Among thetested algorithms are the well-known Runge-Kutta scheme in two differentimplementations as well as methods especially developed for time propagation:the Short Iterative Arnoldi, Chebyshev and Newtonian propagators. In addition,an implementation of a symplectic integrator has been studied. For a simpleexample of a two-center electron transfer system we discuss some aspects of theefficiency of these methods to integrate the equations of motion. Overall fortime-independent potentials the Newtonian method is recommended. Fortime-dependent potentials implementations of the Runge-Kutta algorithm are veryefficient.

Markovian Statistics on Evolving Systems

  A novel framework for the analysis of observation statistics on time discretelinear evolutions in Banach space is presented. The model differs fromtraditional models for stochastic processes and, in particular, clearlydistinguishes between the deterministic evolution of a system and thestochastic nature of observations on the evolving system. General Markov chainsare defined in this context and it is shown how typical traditional models ofclassical or quantum random walks and Markov processes fit into the frameworkand how a theory of quantum statistics ({\it sensu} Barndorff-Nielsen, Gill andJupp) may be developed from it. The framework permits a general theory of jointobservability of two or more observation variables which may be viewed as anextension of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and, in particular, offers anovel mathematical perspective on the violation of Bell's inequalities inquantum models. Main results include a general sampling theorem relative toRiesz evolution operators in the spirit of von Neumann's mean ergodic theoremfor normal operators in Hilbert space.

Entanglement and boundary critical phenomena

  We investigate boundary critical phenomena from a quantum informationperspective. Bipartite entanglement in the ground state of one-dimensionalquantum systems is quantified using the Renyi entropy S_alpha, which includesthe von Neumann entropy (alpha=1) and the single-copy entanglement(alpha=infinity) as special cases. We identify the contribution from theboundary entropy to the Renyi entropy, and show that there is an entanglementloss along boundary renormalization group (RG) flows. This property, which isintimately related to the Affleck-Ludwig g-theorem, can be regarded as aconsequence of majorization relations between the spectra of the reduceddensity matrix along the boundary RG flows. We also point out that the bulkcontribution to the single-copy entanglement is half of that to the von Neumannentropy, whereas the boundary contribution is the same.

A Mosaic of the Coma Cluster of Galaxies with XMM-Newton

  The Coma cluster of galaxies was observed with XMM-Newton in 12 partiallyoverlapping pointings. We present here the resulting X-ray map in differentenergy bands and discuss the large scale structure of this cluster. Many pointsources were found throughout the observed area, at least 11 of them arecoincident with bright galaxies. We also give a hardness ratio map at the sofar highest angular resolution obtained for a cluster of galaxies. In this mapwe found soft regions at the position of bright galaxies, little variation inthe central 15 arcmin, but some harder regions north of the line NGC 4874 - NGC4889.

Localization of Inner-Shell Photoelectron Emission and Interatomic  Coulombic Decay in Ne$_2$

  We used Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) toinvestigate the decay of Ne$_2$ after K-shell photoionization. The breakup intoNe$^{1+}$ / Ne$^{2+}$ shows interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) occurring after apreceding atomic Auger decay. The molecular frame angular distributions of thephotoelectron and the ICD electron show distinct, asymmetric features, whichimply localization of the K-vacancy created at one of the two atomic sites ofthe Ne$_2$ and an emission of the ICD electron from a localized site. Theexperimental results are supported by calculations in frozen core Hartree-Fockapproach.

Scene Labeling using Gated Recurrent Units with Explicit Long Range  Conditioning

  Recurrent neural network (RNN), as a powerful contextual dependency modelingframework, has been widely applied to scene labeling problems. However, thiswork shows that directly applying traditional RNN architectures, which unfoldsa 2D lattice grid into a sequence, is not sufficient to model structuredependencies in images due to the "impact vanishing" problem. First, we give anempirical analysis about the "impact vanishing" problem. Then, a new RNN unitnamed Recurrent Neural Network with explicit long range conditioning (RNN-ELC)is designed to alleviate this problem. A novel neural network architecture isbuilt for scene labeling tasks where one of the variants of the new RNN unit,Gated Recurrent Unit with Explicit Long-range Conditioning (GRU-ELC), is usedto model multi scale contextual dependencies in images. We validate the use ofGRU-ELC units with state-of-the-art performance on three standard scenelabeling datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the new GRU-ELCunit benefits scene labeling problem a lot as it can encode longer contextualdependencies in images more effectively than traditional RNN units.

Shape Inpainting using 3D Generative Adversarial Network and Recurrent  Convolutional Networks

  Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have shown promising resultsin 3D shape completion. But due to GPU memory limitations, these methods canonly produce low-resolution outputs. To inpaint 3D models with semanticplausibility and contextual details, we introduce a hybrid framework thatcombines a 3D Encoder-Decoder Generative Adversarial Network (3D-ED-GAN) and aLong-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN). The 3D-ED-GAN is a 3Dconvolutional neural network trained with a generative adversarial paradigm tofill missing 3D data in low-resolution. LRCN adopts a recurrent neural networkarchitecture to minimize GPU memory usage and incorporates an Encoder-Decoderpair into a Long Short-term Memory Network. By handling the 3D model as asequence of 2D slices, LRCN transforms a coarse 3D shape into a more completeand higher resolution volume. While 3D-ED-GAN captures global contextualstructure of the 3D shape, LRCN localizes the fine-grained details.Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic data show reconstructionsfrom corrupted models result in complete and high-resolution 3D objects.

SGPN: Similarity Group Proposal Network for 3D Point Cloud Instance  Segmentation

  We introduce Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN), a simple and intuitivedeep learning framework for 3D object instance segmentation on point clouds.SGPN uses a single network to predict point grouping proposals and acorresponding semantic class for each proposal, from which we can directlyextract instance segmentation results. Important to the effectiveness of SGPNis its novel representation of 3D instance segmentation results in the form ofa similarity matrix that indicates the similarity between each pair of pointsin embedded feature space, thus producing an accurate grouping proposal foreach point. To the best of our knowledge, SGPN is the first framework to learn3D instance-aware semantic segmentation on point clouds. Experimental resultson various 3D scenes show the effectiveness of our method on 3D instancesegmentation, and we also evaluate the capability of SGPN to improve 3D objectdetection and semantic segmentation results. We also demonstrate itsflexibility by seamlessly incorporating 2D CNN features into the framework toboost performance.

Learning to Prune Filters in Convolutional Neural Networks

  Many state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms use large scaleconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) as basic building blocks. These CNNs areknown for their huge number of parameters, high redundancy in weights, andtremendous computing resource consumptions. This paper presents a learningalgorithm to simplify and speed up these CNNs. Specifically, we introduce a"try-and-learn" algorithm to train pruning agents that remove unnecessary CNNfilters in a data-driven way. With the help of a novel reward function, ouragents removes a significant number of filters in CNNs while maintainingperformance at a desired level. Moreover, this method provides an easy controlof the tradeoff between network performance and its scale. Per- formance of ouralgorithm is validated with comprehensive pruning experiments on severalpopular CNNs for visual recognition and semantic segmentation tasks.

Recurrent Slice Networks for 3D Segmentation of Point Clouds

  Point clouds are an efficient data format for 3D data. However, existing 3Dsegmentation methods for point clouds either do not model local dependencies\cite{pointnet} or require added computations \cite{kd-net,pointnet2}. Thiswork presents a novel 3D segmentation framework, RSNet\footnote{Codes arereleased here https://github.com/qianguih/RSNet}, to efficiently model localstructures in point clouds. The key component of the RSNet is a lightweightlocal dependency module. It is a combination of a novel slice pooling layer,Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers, and a slice unpooling layer. The slicepooling layer is designed to project features of unordered points onto anordered sequence of feature vectors so that traditional end-to-end learningalgorithms (RNNs) can be applied. The performance of RSNet is validated bycomprehensive experiments on the S3DIS\cite{stanford}, ScanNet\cite{scannet},and ShapeNet \cite{shapenet} datasets. In its simplest form, RSNets surpass allprevious state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks. And comparisons againstprevious state-of-the-art methods \cite{pointnet, pointnet2} demonstrate theefficiency of RSNets.

Depth-aware CNN for RGB-D Segmentation

  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are limited by the lack of capability tohandle geometric information due to the fixed grid kernel structure. Theavailability of depth data enables progress in RGB-D semantic segmentation withCNNs. State-of-the-art methods either use depth as additional images or processspatial information in 3D volumes or point clouds. These methods suffer fromhigh computation and memory cost. To address these issues, we presentDepth-aware CNN by introducing two intuitive, flexible and effectiveoperations: depth-aware convolution and depth-aware average pooling. Byleveraging depth similarity between pixels in the process of informationpropagation, geometry is seamlessly incorporated into CNN. Without introducingany additional parameters, both operators can be easily integrated intoexisting CNNs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on challenging RGB-Dsemantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and flexibility ofour approach.

Stochastic Dynamics for Video Infilling

  In this paper, we introduce a stochastic generation framework (SDVI) toinfill long intervals in video sequences. To enhance the temporal resolution,video interpolation aims to produce transitional frames for a short intervalbetween every two frames. Video Infilling, however, aims to complete longintervals in a video sequence. Our framework models the infilling as aconstrained stochastic generation process and sequentially samples dynamicsfrom the inferred distribution. SDVI consists of two parts: (1) abi-directional constraint propagation to guarantee the spatial-temporalcoherency among frames, (2) a stochastic sampling process to generate dynamicsfrom the inferred distributions. Experimental results show that SDVI cangenerate clear and varied sequences. Moreover, motions in the generatedsequence are realistic and able to transfer smoothly from the referenced startframe to the end frame.

Efficient Multi-Domain Dictionary Learning with GANs

  In this paper, we propose the multi-domain dictionary learning (MDDL) to makedictionary learning-based classification more robust to data representing indifferent domains. We use adversarial neural networks to generate data indifferent styles, and collect all the generated data into a miscellaneousdictionary. To tackle the dictionary learning with many samples, we compute theweighting matrix that compress the miscellaneous dictionary from multi-sampleper class to single sample per class. We show that the time complexity solvingthe proposed MDDL with weighting matrix is the same as solving the dictionarywith single sample per class. Moreover, since the weighting matrix could helpthe solver rely more on the training data, which possibly lie in the samedomain with the testing data, the classification could be more accurate.

3DN: 3D Deformation Network

  Applications in virtual and augmented reality create a demand for rapidcreation and easy access to large sets of 3D models. An effective way toaddress this demand is to edit or deform existing 3D models based on areference, e.g., a 2D image which is very easy to acquire. Given such a source3D model and a target which can be a 2D image, 3D model, or a point cloudacquired as a depth scan, we introduce 3DN, an end-to-end network that deformsthe source model to resemble the target. Our method infers per-vertex offsetdisplacements while keeping the mesh connectivity of the source model fixed. Wepresent a training strategy which uses a novel differentiable operation, meshsampling operator, to generalize our method across source and target modelswith varying mesh densities. Mesh sampling operator can be seamlesslyintegrated into the network to handle meshes with different topologies.Qualitative and quantitative results show that our method generates higherquality results compared to the state-of-the art learning-based methods for 3Dshape generation. Code is available at github.com/laughtervv/3DN.

Multiple Star Systems in the Orion Nebula

  This work presents an interferometric study of the massive-binary fraction inthe Orion Trapezium Cluster with the recently comissioned GRAVITY instrument.We observe a total of 16 stars of mainly OB spectral type. We find threepreviously unknown companions for $\theta ^1$ Ori B, $\theta ^2$ Ori B, and$\theta ^2$ Ori C. We determine a separation for the previously suspectedcompanion of NU Ori. We confirm four companions for $\theta ^1$ Ori A, $\theta^1$ Ori C, $\theta ^1$ Ori D, and $\theta ^2$ Ori A, all with substantiallyimproved astrometry and photometric mass estimates. We refine the orbit of theeccentric high-mass binary $\theta ^1$ Ori C and we are able to derive a neworbit for $\theta ^1$ Ori D. We find a system mass of 21.7 $M_{\odot}$ and aperiod of $53$ days. Together with other previously detected companions seen inspectroscopy or direct imaging, eleven of the 16 high-mass stars are multiplesystems. We obtain a total number of 22 companions with separations up to 600AU. The companion fraction of the early B and O stars in our sample is about 2,significantly higher than in earlier studies of mostly OB associations. Theseparation distribution hints towards a bimodality. Such a bimodality has beenpreviously found in A stars, but rarely in OB binaries, which up to this pointhave been assumed to be mostly compact with a tail of wider companions. We alsodo not find a substantial population of equal-mass binaries. The observeddistribution of mass ratios declines steeply with mass, and like the directstar counts, indicates that our companions follow a standard power law initialmass function. Again, this is in contrast to earlier findings of flat massratio distributions in OB associations. We exclude collision as a dominantformation mechanism but find no clear preference for core accretion orcompetitive accretion.
