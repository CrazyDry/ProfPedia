Negative spin Hall magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/Ta  bilayer at low temperature region

  We investigate the observation of negative spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR)in antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/Ta bilayers at low temperature. The sign of the SMRsignals is changed from positive to negative monotonously from 300 K to 50 K.The change of the signs for SMR is related with the competitions between thesurface ferromagnetism and bulky antiferromagnetic of Cr2O3. The surfacemagnetizations of Cr2O3 (0001) is considered to be dominated at highertemperature, while the bulky antiferromagnetics gets to be robust withdecreasing of temperature. The slopes of the abnormal Hall curves coincide withthe signs of SMR, confirming variational interface magnetism of Cr2O3 atdifferent temperature. From the observed SMR ratio under 3 T, the spin mixingconductance at Cr2O3/Ta interface is estimated to be 1.12*10^14 (ohm^-1*m^-2),which is comparable to that of YIG/Pt structures and our early results ofCr2O3/W.
