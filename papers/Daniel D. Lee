Identifying Reference Spans: Topic Modeling and Word Embeddings help IR

  The CL-SciSumm 2016 shared task introduced an interesting problem: given a
document D and a piece of text that cites D, how do we identify the text spans
of D being referenced by the piece of text? The shared task provided the first
annotated dataset for studying this problem. We present an analysis of our
continued work in improving our system's performance on this task. We
demonstrate how topic models and word embeddings can be used to surpass the
previously best performing system.


Vortex lattice structures and pairing symmetry in Sr2RuO4

  Recent experimental results indicate that superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 is
described by the p-wave E_u representation of the D_{4h} point group. Results
on the vortex lattice structures for this representation are presented. The
theoretical results are compared with experiment.


Short-Term Memory in Orthogonal Neural Networks

  We study the ability of linear recurrent networks obeying discrete time
dynamics to store long temporal sequences that are retrievable from the
instantaneous state of the network. We calculate this temporal memory capacity
for both distributed shift register and random orthogonal connectivity
matrices. We show that the memory capacity of these networks scales with system
size.


Electrolyte gate-controlled Kondo effect in SrTiO3

  We report low-temperature, high-field magnetotransport measurements of SrTiO3
gated by an ionic gel electrolyte. A saturating resistance upturn and negative
magnetoresistance that signal the emergence of the Kondo effect appear for
higher applied gate voltages. This observation, enabled by the wide tunability
of the ionic gel-applied electric field, promotes the interpretation of the
electric field-effect induced 2D electron system in SrTiO3 as an admixture of
magnetic Ti3+ ions, i.e. localized and unpaired electrons, and delocalized
electrons that partially fill the Ti 3d conduction band.


Limits on Radio Continuum Emission from a Sample of Candidate
  Contracting Starless Cores

  We used the NRAO Very Large Array to search for 3.6 cm continuum emission
from embedded protostars in a sample of 8 nearby ``starless'' cores that show
spectroscopic evidence for infalling motions in molecular emission lines. We
detect a total of 13 compact sources in the eight observed fields to 5 sigma
limiting flux levels of typically 0.09 mJy. None of these sources lie within 1'
of the central positions of the cores, and they are all likely background
objects. Based on an extrapolation of the empirical correlation between the
bolometric luminosity and 3.6 cm luminosity for the youngest protostars, these
null-detections place upper limits of ~0.1 L_sun (d/140pc)^2 on the
luminosities of protostellar sources embedded within these cores. These limits,
together with the extended nature of the inward motions inferred from molecular
line mapping (Lee et al. 2001), are inconsistent with the inside-out collapse
model of singular isothermal spheres and suggest a less centrally condensed
phase of core evolution during the earliest stages of star formation.


Onset of dendritic flux avalanches in superconducting films

  We report a detailed comparison of experimental data and theoretical
predictions for the dendritic flux instability, believed to be a generic
behavior of type-II superconducting films. It is shown that a thermo-magnetic
model published very recently [Phys. Rev. B 73, 014512 (2006)] gives an
excellent quantitative description of key features like the instability onset
(first dendrite appearance) magnetic field, and how the onset field depends on
both temperature and sample size. The measurements were made using
magneto-optical imaging on a series of different strip-shaped samples of MgB2.
Excellent agreement is also obtained by reanalyzing data previously published
for Nb.


Marginal Deformations of Field Theories with AdS_4 Duals

  We generate new AdS_4 solutions of D=11 supergravity starting from AdS_4 x
X_7 solutions where X_7 has U(1)^3 isometry. We consider examples where X_7 is
weak G_2, Sasaki-Einstein or tri-Sasakian, corresponding to d=3 SCFTs with
N=1,2 or 3 supersymmetry, respectively, and where the deformed solutions
preserve N=1,2 or 1 supersymmetry, respectively. For the special cases when X_7
is M(3,2), Q(1,1,1) or N(1,1)_I we identify the exactly marginal deformation in
the dual field theory. We also show that the volume of supersymmetric 5-cycles
of N(1,1)_I agrees with the conformal dimension predicted by the baryons of the
dual field theory.


Convenient Interface to Inverse Ising (ConIII): A Python 3 Package for
  Solving Ising-Type Maximum Entropy Models

  ConIII (pronounced CON-ee) is an open-source Python project providing a
simple interface to solving the pairwise and higher order Ising model and a
base for extension to other maximum entropy models. We describe the maximum
entropy problem and give an overview of the algorithms that are implemented as
part of ConIII (https://github.com/eltrompetero/coniii) including Monte Carlo
histogram, pseudolikelihood, minimum probability flow, a regularized mean field
method, and a cluster expansion method. Our goal is to make a variety of
maximum entropy techniques accessible to those unfamiliar with the techniques
and accelerate workflow for users.


Emergent regularities and scaling in armed conflict data

  Large-scale armed conflict is a characteristic feature of modern societies.
The statistics of conflict show remarkable regularities like power law
distributions of fatalities and duration, but lack a unifying framework. We
explore a large, detailed data set of $10^5$ armed conflict reports spanning 20
years across nearly $10^4$ kilometers. By systematically clustering
spatiotemporally proximate events into conflict avalanches, we show that the
number of conflict reports, fatalities, duration, and geographic extent satisfy
consistent power law scaling relations. The temporal evolution of conflicts
measured by these scaling variables display emergent symmetry, collapsing onto
a universal dynamical profile over a range of scales. The measured exponents
and dynamical profiles describe a system distinct from prevailing explanations
of conflict growth such as forest fire models. Our findings suggest that armed
conflicts are dominated by a low-dimensional process that scales with physical
dimensions in a surprisingly unified and predictable way.


The $p$-Adic Valuations of Weil Sums of Binomials

  We investigate the $p$-adic valuation of Weil sums of the form
$W_{F,d}(a)=\sum_{x \in F} \psi(x^d -a x)$, where $F$ is a finite field of
characteristic $p$, $\psi$ is the canonical additive character of $F$, the
exponent $d$ is relatively prime to $|F^\times|$, and $a$ is an element of $F$.
Such sums often arise in arithmetical calculations and also have applications
in information theory. For each $F$ and $d$ one would like to know $V_{F,d}$,
the minimum $p$-adic valuation of $W_{F,d}(a)$ as $a$ runs through the elements
of $F$. We exclude exponents $d$ that are congruent to a power of $p$ modulo
$|F^\times|$ (degenerate $d$), which yield trivial Weil sums. We prove that
$V_{F,d} \leq (2/3)[F\colon{\mathbb F}_p]$ for any $F$ and any nondegenerate
$d$, and prove that this bound is actually reached in infinitely many fields
$F$. We also prove some stronger bounds that apply when $[F\colon{\mathbb
F}_p]$ is a power of $2$ or when $d$ is not congruent to $1$ modulo $p-1$, and
show that each of these bounds is reached for infinitely many $F$.


The Possible Interstellar Anion CH2CN-: Spectroscopic Constants,
  Vibrational Frequencies, and Other Considerations

  It is hypothesized that the A ^1B_1 <- X ^1A' excitation into the
dipole-bound state of the cyanomethyl anion (CH2CN-) is proposed as the carrier
for one diffuse interstellar band. However, this particular molecular system
has not been detected in the interstellar medium even though the related
cyanomethyl radical and the isoelectronic ketenimine molecule have been found.
In this study we are employing the use of proven quartic force fields and
second-order vibrational perturbation theory to compute accurate spectroscopic
constants and fundamental vibrational frequencies for ^1A' CH2CN- in order to
assist in laboratory studies and astronomical observations.


Searching for the $X(3872)$ and $Z_c^+(3900)$ on HISQ lattices

  We present preliminary simulation results for the I = 0 charmonium state
$X(3872)(1^{++})$ and the I = 1 charmonium state $Z_c^+(3900)(1^{+-})$. The
study is performed on gauge field configurations with 2+1+1 flavors of highly
improved staggered sea quarks (HISQ) with clover (Fermilab interpretation)
charm quarks and HISQ light valence quarks. Since the $X(3872)$ lies very close
to the open charm $D \bar D^*$ threshold, we use a combination of $\bar c c$
and $D \bar D^* + \bar D D^*$ interpolating operators. For the $Z_c^+(3900)$ we
use a combination of $J/\psi \pi$ and $D \bar D^* + \bar D D^*$ channels. This
is the first such study with HISQ sea quarks and light valence quarks. To this
end, we describe a variational method for treating staggered quarks that
incorporates both oscillating and non-oscillating components.


Systems engineering applied to ELT instrumentation: The GMACS case

  An important tool for the development of the next generation of extremely
large telescopes (ELTs) is a robust Systems Engineering (SE) methodology. GMACS
is a first-generation multi-object spectrograph that will work at visible
wavelengths on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). In this paper, we discuss
the application of SE to the design of next-generation instruments for
ground-based astronomy and present the ongoing development of SE products for
the GMACS spectrograph, currently in its Conceptual Design phase. SE provides
the means to assist in the management of complex projects, and in the case of
GMACS, to ensure its operational success, maximizing the scientific potential
of GMT.


L-Edge Spectroscopy of Dilute, Radiation-Sensitive Systems Using a
  Transition-Edge-Sensor Array

  We present X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering (RIXS) measurements on the iron L-edge of 0.5 mM aqueous
ferricyanide. These measurements demonstrate the ability of high-throughput
transition-edge-sensor (TES) spectrometers to access the rich soft X-ray
(100-2000eV) spectroscopy regime for dilute and radiation-sensitive samples.
Our low-concentration data are in agreement with high-concentration
measurements recorded by conventional grating-based spectrometers. These
results show that soft X-ray RIXS spectroscopy acquired by high-throughput TES
spectrometers can be used to study the local electronic structure of dilute
metal-centered complexes relevant to biology, chemistry and catalysis. In
particular, TES spectrometers have a unique ability to characterize frozen
solutions of radiation- and temperature-sensitive samples.


Dynamical renormalization group approach to the Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov
  equations

  The Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equations for the parton distribution functions
are rederived using the dynamical renormalization group approach to quantum
kinetics. This method systematically treats the ln Q^2 corrections that arises
in perturbation theory as a renormalization of the parton distribution function
and unambiguously indicates that the strong coupling must be allowed to run
with the scale in the evolution kernel. To leading logarithmic accuracy the
evolution equation is Markovian and the logarithmic divergences in the
perturbative expansion are identified with the secular divergences (terms that
grow in time) that emerge in a perturbative treatment of the kinetic equations
in nonequilibrium systems. The resummation of the leading logarithms by the
Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equation is thus similar to the resummation of the
leading secular terms by the Boltzmann kinetic equation.


Multigap Superconductivity in Chiral Noncentrosymmetric
  TaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$

  We report the first observation of multigap superconductivity in
TaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$. We show TaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$ is a bulk type-II superconductor
with a transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{c}} = 6.00(5)$ K. We present
transverse-field muon spin relaxation data where the superconducting gap can be
fit using a two-gap $\left(s+s\right)$-wave model. We also report the
zero-field electronic specific heat in the superconducting state that is best
described by the same $\left(s+s\right)$ model providing further evidence of
multiband behavior in this superconductor. Zero-field muon spin relaxation
measurements show time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting
state. We demonstrate that TaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$ has an upper critical field of
$15.2(1)$ T, which is significantly higher than previously reported and exceeds
the Pauli limit.


MARVELS-1b: A Short-Period, Brown Dwarf Desert Candidate from the
  SDSS-III MARVELS Planet Search

  We present a new short-period brown dwarf candidate around the star TYC
1240-00945-1. This candidate was discovered in the first year of the
Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanets Large-area Survey (MARVELS), which
is part of the third phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), and we
designate the brown dwarf as MARVELS-1b. MARVELS uses the technique of
dispersed fixed-delay interferometery to simultaneously obtain radial velocity
measurements for 60 objects per field using a single, custom-built instrument
that is fiber fed from the SDSS 2.5-m telescope. From our 20 radial velocity
measurements spread over a ~370 d time baseline, we derive a Keplerian orbital
fit with semi-amplitude K=2.533+/-0.025 km/s, period P=5.8953+/-0.0004 d, and
eccentricity consistent with circular. Independent follow-up radial velocity
data confirm the orbit. Adopting a mass of 1.37+/-0.11 M_Sun for the slightly
evolved F9 host star, we infer that the companion has a minimum mass of
28.0+/-1.5 M_Jup, a semimajor axis 0.071+/-0.002 AU assuming an edge-on orbit,
and is probably tidally synchronized. We find no evidence for coherent
instrinsic variability of the host star at the period of the companion at
levels greater than a few millimagnitudes. The companion has an a priori
transit probability of ~14%. Although we find no evidence for transits, we
cannot definitively rule them out for companion radii ~<1 R_Jup.


Signs of Analyticity in Single-Field Inflation

  The analyticity of response functions and scattering amplitudes implies
powerful relations between low-energy observables and the underlying
short-distance dynamics. These 'IR/UV' relations are rooted in basic physical
principles, such as causality and unitarity. In this paper, we seek similar
connections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physics
responsible for the accelerated expansion. We assume that the inflationary
theory is Lorentz invariant at short distances, but allow for non-relativistic
interactions and a non-trivial speed of propagation at low energies. Focusing
on forward scattering, we derive a 'sum rule' which equates a combination of
low-energy parameters to an integral which is sensitive to the high-energy
behavior of the theory. While for relativistic amplitudes unitarity is
sufficient to prove positivity of the sum rule, this is not guaranteed in the
non-relativistic case. We discuss the conditions under which positivity still
applies, and show that they are satisfied by all known UV completions of
single-field inflation. In that case, we obtain a consistency condition for
primordial non-Gaussianity, which constrains the size and the sign of the
equilateral four-point function in terms of the amplitude of the three-point
function. The resulting bound rules out about half of the parameter space that
is still allowed by current observations. Finding a violation of our
consistency condition would point towards less conventional theories of
inflation, or violations of basic physical principles.


Reheating the Post Inflationary Universe

  We consider the non-equilibrium evolution of the inflaton field coupled to
both lighter scalars and fermions. The dissipational dynamics of this field is
studied and found to be quite different than that believed in inflationary
models. In particular, the damping time scale for the expectation value of the
zero momentum mode of the inflaton can be much shorter than that given by the
single particle decay rate when the inflaton amplitudes are large, as in
chaotic inflation scenarios. We find that the reheating temperature may depart
considerably from the usual estimates.


New Aspects of Reheating

  The reheating stage in post-inflationary cosmologies is reanalyzed. New
techniques from non-equilibrium quantum field theory allow a consistent
derivation of the equation of motion including the non-linearity of the
dynamics. These offer a rationale for the elementary theory of reheating based
on single particle decay which is seen to be valid only in the linear regime of
coherent oscillations of the scalar field. A new non-perturbative mechanism of
induced amplification of quantum fluctuations is introduced and studied in
detail, both analytically and numerically. This is a non-linear mechanism that
is typically a far more efficient way of transfering energy out of the zero
mode and into production of lighter particles than single particle decay.
Thermalization is discussed and we estimate the reheating temperature to be of
the order of the inflaton mass, thus providing a potential solution to the
Polonyi and moduli problems.


Phase Transitions out of Equilibrium: domain formation and growth

  We study the dynamics of phase transitions out of equilibrium in weakly
coupled scalar field theories. We consider the case in which there is a rapid
supercooling from an initial symmetric phase in thermal equilibrium at
temperature $T_i>T_c$ to a final state at low temperature $T_f \approx 0$. In
particular we study the formation and growth of correlated domains out of
equilibrium. It is shown that the dynamics of the process of domain formation
and growth (spinodal decomposition) cannot be studied in perturbation theory,
and a non-perturbative self-consistent Hartree approximation is used to study
the long time evolution. We find in weakly coupled theories that the size of
domains grow at long times as $\xi_D(t) \approx \sqrt{t\xi(0)}$. For very
weakly coupled theories, their final size is several times the zero temperature
correlation length. For strongly coupled theories the final size of the domains
is comparable to the zero temperature correlation length and the transition
proceeds faster.


Electronic transport in iron atomic contacts: from the infinite wire to
  realistic geometries

  We present a theoretical study of spin polarized transport in Fe atomic
contacts using a self-consistent tight-binding Hamiltonian in a non-orthogonal
$s$, $p$ and $d$ basis set, the spin-polarization being obtained from a
non-collinear Stoner-like model and the transmission probability from the
Fisher-Lee formula. The behaviour of an infinite perfect Fe wire is compared
with that of an infinite chain presenting geometric defects or magnetic walls
and with that of a finite chain connected to infinite one-dimensional or
three-dimensional leads. In the presence of defects or contacts the
transmission probability of $d$ electrons is much more affected than that of
$s$ electrons, in particular, contact effects may suppress some transmission
channels. It is shown that the behaviour of an infinite wire is never obtained
even in the limit of long chains connected to electrodes. The introduction of
the spin-orbit coupling term in the Hamiltonian enables us to calculate the
anisotropy of the magneto-resistance. Finally whereas the variation of the
magneto-resistance as a function of the magnetization direction is step-like
for an infinite wire, it becomes smooth in the presence of defects or contacts.


Mechanisms in knockout reactions

  We report on the first detailed study of the mechanisms involved in knockout
reactions, via a coincidence measurement of the residue and fast proton in
one-proton knockout reactions, using the S800 spectrograph in combination with
the HiRA detector array at the NSCL. Results on the reactions
$^9$Be($^9$C,$^8$B+X)Y and $^9$Be($^8$B,$^7$Be+X)Y are presented. They are
compared with theoretical predictions for both the diffraction and stripping
reaction mechanisms, as calculated in the eikonal model. The data shows a clear
distinction between the two reaction mechanisms, and the observed respective
proportions are very well reproduced by the reaction theory. This agreement
supports the results of knockout reaction analyses and their applications to
the spectroscopy of rare isotopes.


The Spitzer Local Volume Legacy (LVL) Global Optical Photometry

  We present the global optical photometry of 246 galaxies in the Local Volume
Legacy (LVL) survey. The full volume-limited sample consists of 258 nearby (D <
11 Mpc) galaxies whose absolute B-band magnitude span a range of -9.6 < M_B <
-20.7 mag. A composite optical (UBVR) data set is constructed from observed
UBVR and SDSS ugriz imaging, where the ugriz magnitudes are transformed into
UBVR. We present photometry within three galaxy apertures defined at UV,
optical, and IR wavelengths. Flux comparisons between these apertures reveal
that the traditional optical R25 galaxy apertures do not fully encompass
extended sources. Using the larger IR apertures we find color-color
relationships where later-type spiral and irregular galaxies tend to be bluer
than earlier-type galaxies. These data provide the missing optical emission
from which future LVL studies can construct the full panchromatic
(UV-optical-IR) spectral energy distributions.


Empirical ugri-UBVRc Transformations for Galaxies

  We present empirical color transformations between Sloan Digital Sky Survey
ugri and Johnson-Cousins UBVRc photometry for nearby galaxies (D < 11 Mpc). We
use the Local Volume Legacy (LVL) galaxy sample where there are 90 galaxies
with overlapping observational coverage for these two filter sets. The LVL
galaxy sample consists of normal, non-starbursting galaxies. We also examine
how well the LVL galaxy colors are described by previous transformations
derived from standard calibration stars and model-based galaxy templates. We
find significant galaxy color scatter around most of the previous
transformation relationships. In addition, the previous transformations show
systematic offsets between transformed and observed galaxy colors which are
visible in observed color-color trends. The LVL-based $galaxy$ transformations
show no systematic color offsets and reproduce the observed color-color galaxy
trends.


Comparative study of the pressure effects on the magnetic penetration
  depth in electron- and hole-doped cuprate superconductors

  The effect of pressure on the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$ was tested
in the hole-doped superconductor YBa2Cu3O(7-d) and in the electron-doped one
Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of magnetization measurements. Whereas a large change
of $\lambda$ was found in YBa2Cu3O(7-d), confirming the non-adiabatic character
of the electron-phonon coupling in hole-doped superconductors, the same
quantity is not affected by pressure in the electron-doped Sr0.9La0.1CuO2,
suggesting a close similarity of the latter to conventional adiabatic BCS
superconductors. The present results imply a remarkable difference between the
electronic properties of hole-doped cuprates and the electron-doped
Sr0.9La0.1CuO2, giving a strong contribution to the long debated asymmetric
consequences of hole- and electron-doping in cuprate superconductors.


Superconducting and normal-state properties of the noncentrosymmetric
  superconductor Re6Zr

  We systematically investigate the normal and superconducting properties of
non-centrosymmetric Re$_{6}$Zr using magnetization, heat capacity, and
electrical resistivity measurements. Resistivity measurements indicate
Re$_{6}$Zr has poor metallic behavior and is dominated by disorder. Re$_6$Zr
undergoes a superconducting transition at $T_{\mathrm{c}} =
\left(6.75\pm0.05\right)$ K. Magnetization measurements give a lower critical
field, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c1}} = \left(10.3 \pm 0.1\right)$ mT. The
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model is used to approximate the upper critical
field $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c2}} = \left(11.2 \pm 0.2\right)$ T which is close to
the Pauli limiting field of 12.35 T and which could indicate singlet-triplet
mixing. However, low-temperature specific-heat data suggest that Re$_{6}$Zr is
an isotropic, fully gapped s-wave superconductor with enhanced electron-phonon
coupling. Unusual flux pinning resulting in a peak effect is observed in the
magnetization data, indicating an unconventional vortex state.


Gate-Defined Quantum Confinement in InSe-based van der Waals
  Heterostructures

  Indium selenide, a post-transition metal chalcogenide, is a novel
two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with interesting electronic properties. Its
tunable band gap and high electron mobility have already attracted considerable
research interest. Here we demonstrate strong quantum confinement and
manipulation of single electrons in devices made from few-layer crystals of
InSe using electrostatic gating. We report on gate-controlled quantum dots in
the Coulomb blockade regime as well as one-dimensional quantization in point
contacts, revealing multiple plateaus. The work represents an important
milestone in the development of quality devices based on 2D materials and makes
InSe a prime candidate for relevant electronic and optoelectronic applications.


Search for Sub-threshold Photoproduction of J/Psi Mesons

  A search was made for sub-threshold $J/\psi$ production from a carbon target
using a mixed real and quasi-real Bremsstrahlung photon beam with an endpoint
energy of 5.76 GeV. No events were observed, which is consistent with
predictions assuming quasi-free production. The results place limits on exotic
mechanisms that strongly enhance quasi-free production.


Surges of collective human activity emerge from simple pairwise
  correlations

  Human populations exhibit complex behaviors---characterized by long-range
correlations and surges in activity---across a range of social, political, and
technological contexts. Yet it remains unclear where these collective behaviors
come from, or if there even exists a set of unifying principles. Indeed,
existing explanations typically rely on context-specific mechanisms, such as
traffic jams driven by work schedules or spikes in online traffic induced by
significant events. However, analogies with statistical mechanics suggest a
more general mechanism: that collective patterns can emerge organically from
fine-scale interactions within a population. Here, across four different modes
of human activity, we show that the simplest correlations in a
population---those between pairs of individuals---can yield accurate
quantitative predictions for the large-scale behavior of the entire population.
To quantify the minimal consequences of pairwise correlations, we employ the
principle of maximum entropy, making our description equivalent to an Ising
model whose interactions and external fields are notably calculated from past
observations of population activity. In addition to providing accurate
quantitative predictions, we show that the topology of learned Ising
interactions resembles the network of inter-human communication within a
population. Together, these results demonstrate that fine-scale correlations
can be used to predict large-scale social behaviors, a perspective that has
critical implications for modeling and resource allocation in human
populations.


Splittings of low-lying charmonium masses at the physical point

  We present high-precision results from lattice QCD for the mass splittings of
the low-lying charmonium states. For the valence charm quark, the calculation
uses Wilson-clover quarks in the Fermilab interpretation. The gauge-field
ensembles are generated in the presence of up, down, and strange sea quarks,
based on the improved staggered (asqtad) action, and gluon fields, based on the
one-loop, tadpole-improved gauge action. We use five lattice spacings and two
values of the light sea quark mass to extrapolate the results to the physical
point. An enlarged set of interpolating operators is used for a variational
analysis to improve the determination of the energies of the ground states in
each channel. We present and implement a continuum extrapolation within the
Fermilab interpretation, based on power-counting arguments, and thoroughly
discuss all sources of systematic uncertainty. We compare our results for
various mass splittings with their experimental values, namely, the 1S
hyperfine splitting, the 1P-1S splitting and the P-wave spin-orbit and tensor
splittings. Given the uncertainty related to the width of the resonances, we
find excellent agreement.


Direct Oxygen Abundances for Low Luminosity LVL Galaxies

  We present MMT spectroscopic observations of HII regions in 42 low luminosity
galaxies in the LVL. For 31 galaxies, we measured the temperature sensitive [O
III] line at a strength of 4 sigma or greater, and thus determine direct oxygen
abundances. Our results provide the first direct estimates of oxygen abundance
for 19 galaxies. Oxygen abundances were compared to B-band and 4.5 micron
luminosities and stellar masses in order to characterize the
luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) and mass-metallicity (M-Z) relationships at
low-luminosity.
  We present and analyze a "Combined Select" sample composed of 38 objects
(drawn from our parent sample and the literature) with direct oxygen abundances
and reliable distance determinations (TRGB or Ceph). Consistent with previous
studies, the B-band and 4.5 micron L-Z relationships were found to be
12+log(O/H)=(6.27+/-0.21)+(-0.11+/-0.01)M_B and
12+log(O/H)=(6.10+/-0.21)+(-0.10+/-0.01)M_[4.5] (sigma=0.15 and 0.14). For this
sample, we derive a M-Z relationship of
12+log(O/H)=(5.61+/-0.24)+(0.29+/-0.03)log(M*), which agrees with previous
studies; however, the dispersion (sigma=0.15) is not significantly lower than
that of the L-Z relationships. Because of the low dispersions in these
relationships, if an accurate distance is available, the luminosity of a
low-luminosity galaxy is often a better indicator of metallicity than that
derived using certain strong-line methods, so significant departures from the
L-Z relationships may indicate that caution is prudent in such cases. We also
revisit the 70/160 micron color metallicity relationship.
  Additionally, we examine N/O abundance trends with respect to oxygen
abundance and B-V color. We find a positive correlation between N/O ratio and
B-V color for 0.05\lesssimB-V\lesssim0.75:
log(N/O)=(1.18+/-0.9)x(B-V)+(-1.92+/-0.08), with a dispersion of sigma=0.14,
that is in agreement with previous studies.


Modeling the Effects of Star Formation Histories on Halpha and
  Ultra-Violet Fluxes in Nearby Dwarf Galaxies

  We consider the effects of non-constant star formation histories (SFHs) on
Halpha and GALEX far ultra-violet (FUV) star formation rate (SFR) indicators.
Under the assumption of a fully populated Chabrier IMF, we compare the
distribution of Halpha-to-FUV flux ratios from ~ 1500 simple, periodic model
SFHs with observations of 185 galaxies from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy
survey. We find a set of SFH models that are well matched to the data, such
that more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant SFHs,
while low mass systems experience bursts amplitudes of ~ 30 (i.e., an increase
in the SFR by a factor of 30 over the SFR during the inter-burst period), burst
durations of tens of Myr, and periods of ~ 250 Myr; these SFHs are broadly
consistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systems
with lower SFRs. We analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellar
mass, R-band surface brightness, Halpha-derived SFR, and blue luminosity, and
find that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. We
find that our model SFHs are generally able to reproduce both the observed
systematic decline and increased scatter in Halpha-to-FUV ratios toward low
mass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. We also compare our
predictions with those from the Integrated Galactic IMF theory with a constant
SFR. We find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observed
ratios, only the time variable SFH models are capable of producing the observed
population of low mass galaxies ($M_{*}$ < 10$^{7}$ Msun) with normal
Halpha-to-FUV ratios. These results demonstrate that a variable IMF alone has
difficulty explaining the observed scatter in the Halpha-to-FUV ratios. We
conclude by considering the limitations of the model SFHs, and discuss the use
of additional empirical constraints to improve future SFH modeling efforts.


A Be star with a low nitrogen abundance in the SMC cluster NGC330

  High-resolution UVES/VLT spectra of B12, an extreme pole-on Be star in the
SMC cluster NGC330, have been analysed using non-LTE model atmospheres to
obtain its chemical composition relative to the SMC standard star AV304. We
find a general underabundance of metals which can be understood in terms of an
extra contribution to the stellar continuum due to emission from a disk which
we estimate to be at the ~25% level. When this is corrected for, the nitrogen
abundance for B12 shows no evidence of enhancement by rotational mixing as has
been found in other non-Be B-type stars in NGC330, and is inconsistent with
evolutionary models which include the effects of rotational mixing. A second Be
star, NGC330-B17, is also shown to have no detectable nitrogen lines. Possible
explanations for the lack of rotational mixing in these rapidly rotating stars
are discussed, one promising solution being the possibility that magnetic
fields might inhibit rotational mixing.


Equilibrium Properties of Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Plasticity

  A theory of temporally asymmetric Hebb (TAH) rules which depress or
potentiate synapses depending upon whether the postsynaptic cell fires before
or after the presynaptic one is presented. Using the Fokker-Planck formalism,
we show that the equilibrium synaptic distribution induced by such rules is
highly sensitive to the manner in which bounds on the allowed range of synaptic
values are imposed. In a biologically plausible multiplicative model, we find
that the synapses in asynchronous networks reach a distribution that is
invariant to the firing rates of either the pre- or post-synaptic cells. When
these cells are temporally correlated, the synaptic strength varies smoothly
with the degree and phase of synchrony between the cells.


Dendritic flux patterns in MgB2 films

  Magneto-opitcal studies of a c-oriented epitaxial MgB2 film with critical
current density 10^7 A/cm^2 demonstrate a breakdown of the critical state at
temperatures below 10 K [cond-mat/0104113]. Instead of conventional uniform and
gradual flux penetration in an applied magnetic field, we observe an abrupt
invasion of complex dendritic structures. When the applied field subsequently
decreases, similar dendritic structures of the return flux penetrate the film.
The static and dynamic properties of the dendrites are discussed.


Current-induced dendritic magnetic instability in superconducting MgB2
  films

  Magneto-optical imaging reveals that in superconducting films of MgB2 a
transport current creates avalanche-like flux dynamics where highly branching
dendritic penetration patterns are formed. The instability is triggered when
the current exceeds a threshold value, and the superconductor, shaped as a long
strip, is initially in the critical state. The instability exists up to 19 K,
which is a much wider temperature range than in previous experiments, where
dendrites were formed by applying a magnetic field. The instability is believed
to be of thermo-magnetic origin indicating that thermal stabilization may
become crucial in applications of MgB2.


Local threshold field for dendritic instability in superconducting MgB2
  films

  Using magneto-optical imaging the phenomenon of dendritic flux penetration in
superconducting films was studied. Flux dendrites were abruptly formed in a 300
nm thick film of MgB2 by applying a perpendicular magnetic field. Detailed
measurements of flux density distributions show that there exists a local
threshold field controlling the nucleation and termination of the dendritic
growth. At 4 K the local threshold field is close to 12 mT in this sample,
where the critical current density is 10^7 A/cm^2. The dendritic instability in
thin films is believed to be of thermo-magnetic origin, but the existence of a
local threshold field, and its small value are features that distinctly
contrast the thermo-magnetic instability (flux jumps) in bulk superconductors.


Interplay of dendritic avalanches and gradual flux penetration in
  superconducting MgB2 films

  Magneto-optical imaging was used to study a zero-field-cooled MgB2 film at
9.6K where in a slowly increasing field the flux penetrates by abrupt formation
of large dendritic structures. Simultaneously, a gradual flux penetration takes
place, eventually covering the dendrites, and a detailed analysis of this
process is reported. We find an anomalously high gradient of the flux density
across a dendrite branch, and a peak value that decreases as the applied field
goes up. This unexpected behaviour is reproduced by flux creep simulations
based on the non-local field-current relation in the perpendicular geometry.
The simulations also provide indirect evidence that flux dendrites are formed
at an elevated local temperature, consistent with a thermo-magnetic mechanism
of the instability


Mesoscopic flux jumps in MgB2 films visualized by magneto-optical
  imaging

  We report on the first spatially resolved observation of mesoscopic flux
jumps in superconducting films. Magneto-optical imaging was used to visualize
the flux penetration in MgB2 films subjected to a slowly varying perpendicular
field. Below 10 K, flux jumps with typical size 10-20 microns and regular shape
are found to occur at random locations along the flux front. The total number
of vortices participating in one jump is varying between 50 and 10000.
Simultaneously, big dendritic jumps with dimensions comparable to the sample
size (10^6-10^8 vortices) are also found in this temperature range. We believe
that both types of jumps result from thermo-magnetic instability.


Size of flux jumps in superconducting films

  Magneto-optical imaging is used to visualize vortex avalanches in MgB2 films
at 4K. Avalanches ranging from 50 to 50000 vortices were detected. The size
distribution function has a clear peak whose position moves towards larger
sizes as the applied field increases. This field dependence as well as
variation of flux density profile during an avalanche are well described by a
proposed model assuming a thermal origin of the avalanches. The model is based
on the adiabatic approach and takes into account nonlocal electrodynamics in
thin superconductors. The threshold field for thermal avalanches is predicted
to be much smaller than that for thick superconductors, in agreement with the
experiment.


Evidence of metallic clustering in annealed Ga1-xMnxAs from atypical
  scaling behavior of the anomalous Hall coefficient

  We report on the anomalous Hall coefficient and longitudinal resistivity
scaling relationships on a series of annealed Ga1-xMnxAs epilayers (x~0.055).
As-grown samples exhibit scaling parameter n of ~ 1. Near the optimal annealing
temperature, we find n ~ 2 to be consistent with recent theories on the
intrinsic origins of anomalous Hall Effect in Ga1-xMnxAs. For annealing
temperatures far above the optimum, we note n > 3, similar behavior to certain
inhomogeneous systems. This observation of atypical behavior agrees well with
characteristic features attributable to spherical resonance from metallic
inclusions from optical spectroscopy measurements.


Interplay between carrier and impurity concentrations in annealed
  Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As intrinsic anomalous Hall Effect

  Investigating the scaling behavior of annealed Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As anomalous
Hall coefficients, we note a universal crossover regime where the scaling
behavior changes from quadratic to linear, attributed to the anomalous Hall
Effect intrinsic and extrinsic origins, respectively. Furthermore, measured
anomalous Hall conductivities when properly scaled by carrier concentration
remain constant, equal to theoretically predicated values, spanning nearly a
decade in conductivity as well as over 100 K in T$_{C}$. Both the qualitative
and quantitative agreement confirms the validity of new equations of motion
including the Berry phase contributions as well as tunablility of the intrinsic
anomalous Hall Effect.


Incommensurate spin-density wave order in electron-doped BaFe2As2
  superconductors

  Neutron diffraction studies of Ba(Fe[1-x]Co[x])2As2 reveal that commensurate
antiferromagnetic order gives way to incommensurate magnetic order for Co
compositions between 0.056 < x < 0.06. The incommensurability has the form of a
small transverse splitting (0, +-e, 0) from the nominal commensurate
antiferromagnetic propagation vector Q[AFM] = (1, 0, 1) (in orthorhombic
notation) where e = 0.02-0.03 and is composition dependent. The results are
consistent with the formation of a spin-density wave driven by Fermi surface
nesting of electron and hole pockets and confirm the itinerant nature of
magnetism in the iron arsenide superconductors.


Weak lensing analysis of RXC J2248.7-4431

  We present a weak lensing analysis of the cluster of galaxies RXC
J2248.7-4431, a massive system at z=0.3475 with prominent strong lensing
features covered by the HST/CLASH survey (Postman et al. 2012). Based on UBVRIZ
imaging from the WFI camera at the MPG/ESO-2.2m telescope, we measure
photometric redshifts and shapes of background galaxies. The cluster is
detected as a mass peak at 5sigma significance. Its density can be parametrised
as an NFW profile (Navarro et al. 1996) with two free parameters, the mass
M_200m=(33.1+9.6-6.8)x10^14Msol and concentration c_200m=2.6+1.5-1.0. We
discover a second cluster inside the field of view at a photometric redshift of
z~0.6, with an NFW mass of M_200m=(4.0+3.7-2.6)x10^14Msol.


An Adversarial Interpretation of Information-Theoretic Bounded
  Rationality

  Recently, there has been a growing interest in modeling planning with
information constraints. Accordingly, an agent maximizes a regularized expected
utility known as the free energy, where the regularizer is given by the
information divergence from a prior to a posterior policy. While this approach
can be justified in various ways, including from statistical mechanics and
information theory, it is still unclear how it relates to decision-making
against adversarial environments. This connection has previously been suggested
in work relating the free energy to risk-sensitive control and to extensive
form games. Here, we show that a single-agent free energy optimization is
equivalent to a game between the agent and an imaginary adversary. The
adversary can, by paying an exponential penalty, generate costs that diminish
the decision maker's payoffs. It turns out that the optimal strategy of the
adversary consists in choosing costs so as to render the decision maker
indifferent among its choices, which is a definining property of a Nash
equilibrium, thus tightening the connection between free energy optimization
and game theory.


Belief Flows of Robust Online Learning

  This paper introduces a new probabilistic model for online learning which
dynamically incorporates information from stochastic gradients of an arbitrary
loss function. Similar to probabilistic filtering, the model maintains a
Gaussian belief over the optimal weight parameters. Unlike traditional Bayesian
updates, the model incorporates a small number of gradient evaluations at
locations chosen using Thompson sampling, making it computationally tractable.
The belief is then transformed via a linear flow field which optimally updates
the belief distribution using rules derived from information theoretic
principles. Several versions of the algorithm are shown using different
constraints on the flow field and compared with conventional online learning
algorithms. Results are given for several classification tasks including
logistic regression and multilayer neural networks.


Linear Readout of Object Manifolds

  Objects are represented in sensory systems by continuous manifolds due to
sensitivity of neuronal responses to changes in physical features such as
location, orientation, and intensity. What makes certain sensory
representations better suited for invariant decoding of objects by downstream
networks? We present a theory that characterizes the ability of a linear
readout network, the perceptron, to classify objects from variable neural
responses. We show how the readout perceptron capacity depends on the
dimensionality, size, and shape of the object manifolds in its input neural
representation.


Mesophase formation in a system of top-shaped hard molecules: Density
  functional theory and Monte Carlo simulation

  We present the phase diagram of a system of mesogenic top-shaped molecules
based on the Parsons- Lee density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulation.
The molecules are modeled as a hard spherocylinder with a hard sphere embedded
in its center. The stability of five different phases is studied, namely,
isotropic, nematic, smectic A, smectic C, and columnar phases. The positionally
ordered phases are investigated only for the case of parallel alignment. It is
found that the central spherical unit destabilizes the nematic with respect to
the isotropic phase, while increasing the length of the cylinder has the
opposite effect. Also, the central hard sphere has a strong destabilizing
effect on the smectic A phase, due the inefficient packing of the molecules
into layers. For large hard sphere units the smectic A phase is completely
replaced by a smectic C structure. The columnar phase is first stabilized with
increasing diameter of the central unit, but for very large hard sphere units
it becomes less stable again. The density functional results are in good
agreement with the simulations.


Learning Discriminative Metrics via Generative Models and Kernel
  Learning

  Metrics specifying distances between data points can be learned in a
discriminative manner or from generative models. In this paper, we show how to
unify generative and discriminative learning of metrics via a kernel learning
framework. Specifically, we learn local metrics optimized from parametric
generative models. These are then used as base kernels to construct a global
kernel that minimizes a discriminative training criterion. We consider both
linear and nonlinear combinations of local metric kernels. Our empirical
results show that these combinations significantly improve performance on
classification tasks. The proposed learning algorithm is also very efficient,
achieving order of magnitude speedup in training time compared to previous
discriminative baseline methods.
