Identifying Reference Spans: Topic Modeling and Word Embeddings help IR

  The CL-SciSumm 2016 shared task introduced an interesting problem: given adocument D and a piece of text that cites D, how do we identify the text spansof D being referenced by the piece of text? The shared task provided the firstannotated dataset for studying this problem. We present an analysis of ourcontinued work in improving our system's performance on this task. Wedemonstrate how topic models and word embeddings can be used to surpass thepreviously best performing system.

Vortex lattice structures and pairing symmetry in Sr2RuO4

  Recent experimental results indicate that superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 isdescribed by the p-wave E_u representation of the D_{4h} point group. Resultson the vortex lattice structures for this representation are presented. Thetheoretical results are compared with experiment.

Short-Term Memory in Orthogonal Neural Networks

  We study the ability of linear recurrent networks obeying discrete timedynamics to store long temporal sequences that are retrievable from theinstantaneous state of the network. We calculate this temporal memory capacityfor both distributed shift register and random orthogonal connectivitymatrices. We show that the memory capacity of these networks scales with systemsize.

Electrolyte gate-controlled Kondo effect in SrTiO3

  We report low-temperature, high-field magnetotransport measurements of SrTiO3gated by an ionic gel electrolyte. A saturating resistance upturn and negativemagnetoresistance that signal the emergence of the Kondo effect appear forhigher applied gate voltages. This observation, enabled by the wide tunabilityof the ionic gel-applied electric field, promotes the interpretation of theelectric field-effect induced 2D electron system in SrTiO3 as an admixture ofmagnetic Ti3+ ions, i.e. localized and unpaired electrons, and delocalizedelectrons that partially fill the Ti 3d conduction band.

Limits on Radio Continuum Emission from a Sample of Candidate  Contracting Starless Cores

  We used the NRAO Very Large Array to search for 3.6 cm continuum emissionfrom embedded protostars in a sample of 8 nearby ``starless'' cores that showspectroscopic evidence for infalling motions in molecular emission lines. Wedetect a total of 13 compact sources in the eight observed fields to 5 sigmalimiting flux levels of typically 0.09 mJy. None of these sources lie within 1'of the central positions of the cores, and they are all likely backgroundobjects. Based on an extrapolation of the empirical correlation between thebolometric luminosity and 3.6 cm luminosity for the youngest protostars, thesenull-detections place upper limits of ~0.1 L_sun (d/140pc)^2 on theluminosities of protostellar sources embedded within these cores. These limits,together with the extended nature of the inward motions inferred from molecularline mapping (Lee et al. 2001), are inconsistent with the inside-out collapsemodel of singular isothermal spheres and suggest a less centrally condensedphase of core evolution during the earliest stages of star formation.

Onset of dendritic flux avalanches in superconducting films

  We report a detailed comparison of experimental data and theoreticalpredictions for the dendritic flux instability, believed to be a genericbehavior of type-II superconducting films. It is shown that a thermo-magneticmodel published very recently [Phys. Rev. B 73, 014512 (2006)] gives anexcellent quantitative description of key features like the instability onset(first dendrite appearance) magnetic field, and how the onset field depends onboth temperature and sample size. The measurements were made usingmagneto-optical imaging on a series of different strip-shaped samples of MgB2.Excellent agreement is also obtained by reanalyzing data previously publishedfor Nb.

Marginal Deformations of Field Theories with AdS_4 Duals

  We generate new AdS_4 solutions of D=11 supergravity starting from AdS_4 xX_7 solutions where X_7 has U(1)^3 isometry. We consider examples where X_7 isweak G_2, Sasaki-Einstein or tri-Sasakian, corresponding to d=3 SCFTs withN=1,2 or 3 supersymmetry, respectively, and where the deformed solutionspreserve N=1,2 or 1 supersymmetry, respectively. For the special cases when X_7is M(3,2), Q(1,1,1) or N(1,1)_I we identify the exactly marginal deformation inthe dual field theory. We also show that the volume of supersymmetric 5-cyclesof N(1,1)_I agrees with the conformal dimension predicted by the baryons of thedual field theory.

Convenient Interface to Inverse Ising (ConIII): A Python 3 Package for  Solving Ising-Type Maximum Entropy Models

  ConIII (pronounced CON-ee) is an open-source Python project providing asimple interface to solving the pairwise and higher order Ising model and abase for extension to other maximum entropy models. We describe the maximumentropy problem and give an overview of the algorithms that are implemented aspart of ConIII (https://github.com/eltrompetero/coniii) including Monte Carlohistogram, pseudolikelihood, minimum probability flow, a regularized mean fieldmethod, and a cluster expansion method. Our goal is to make a variety ofmaximum entropy techniques accessible to those unfamiliar with the techniquesand accelerate workflow for users.

Emergent regularities and scaling in armed conflict data

  Large-scale armed conflict is a characteristic feature of modern societies.The statistics of conflict show remarkable regularities like power lawdistributions of fatalities and duration, but lack a unifying framework. Weexplore a large, detailed data set of $10^5$ armed conflict reports spanning 20years across nearly $10^4$ kilometers. By systematically clusteringspatiotemporally proximate events into conflict avalanches, we show that thenumber of conflict reports, fatalities, duration, and geographic extent satisfyconsistent power law scaling relations. The temporal evolution of conflictsmeasured by these scaling variables display emergent symmetry, collapsing ontoa universal dynamical profile over a range of scales. The measured exponentsand dynamical profiles describe a system distinct from prevailing explanationsof conflict growth such as forest fire models. Our findings suggest that armedconflicts are dominated by a low-dimensional process that scales with physicaldimensions in a surprisingly unified and predictable way.

The $p$-Adic Valuations of Weil Sums of Binomials

  We investigate the $p$-adic valuation of Weil sums of the form$W_{F,d}(a)=\sum_{x \in F} \psi(x^d -a x)$, where $F$ is a finite field ofcharacteristic $p$, $\psi$ is the canonical additive character of $F$, theexponent $d$ is relatively prime to $|F^\times|$, and $a$ is an element of $F$.Such sums often arise in arithmetical calculations and also have applicationsin information theory. For each $F$ and $d$ one would like to know $V_{F,d}$,the minimum $p$-adic valuation of $W_{F,d}(a)$ as $a$ runs through the elementsof $F$. We exclude exponents $d$ that are congruent to a power of $p$ modulo$|F^\times|$ (degenerate $d$), which yield trivial Weil sums. We prove that$V_{F,d} \leq (2/3)[F\colon{\mathbb F}_p]$ for any $F$ and any nondegenerate$d$, and prove that this bound is actually reached in infinitely many fields$F$. We also prove some stronger bounds that apply when $[F\colon{\mathbbF}_p]$ is a power of $2$ or when $d$ is not congruent to $1$ modulo $p-1$, andshow that each of these bounds is reached for infinitely many $F$.

The Possible Interstellar Anion CH2CN-: Spectroscopic Constants,  Vibrational Frequencies, and Other Considerations

  It is hypothesized that the A ^1B_1 <- X ^1A' excitation into thedipole-bound state of the cyanomethyl anion (CH2CN-) is proposed as the carrierfor one diffuse interstellar band. However, this particular molecular systemhas not been detected in the interstellar medium even though the relatedcyanomethyl radical and the isoelectronic ketenimine molecule have been found.In this study we are employing the use of proven quartic force fields andsecond-order vibrational perturbation theory to compute accurate spectroscopicconstants and fundamental vibrational frequencies for ^1A' CH2CN- in order toassist in laboratory studies and astronomical observations.

Searching for the $X(3872)$ and $Z_c^+(3900)$ on HISQ lattices

  We present preliminary simulation results for the I = 0 charmonium state$X(3872)(1^{++})$ and the I = 1 charmonium state $Z_c^+(3900)(1^{+-})$. Thestudy is performed on gauge field configurations with 2+1+1 flavors of highlyimproved staggered sea quarks (HISQ) with clover (Fermilab interpretation)charm quarks and HISQ light valence quarks. Since the $X(3872)$ lies very closeto the open charm $D \bar D^*$ threshold, we use a combination of $\bar c c$and $D \bar D^* + \bar D D^*$ interpolating operators. For the $Z_c^+(3900)$ weuse a combination of $J/\psi \pi$ and $D \bar D^* + \bar D D^*$ channels. Thisis the first such study with HISQ sea quarks and light valence quarks. To thisend, we describe a variational method for treating staggered quarks thatincorporates both oscillating and non-oscillating components.

Systems engineering applied to ELT instrumentation: The GMACS case

  An important tool for the development of the next generation of extremelylarge telescopes (ELTs) is a robust Systems Engineering (SE) methodology. GMACSis a first-generation multi-object spectrograph that will work at visiblewavelengths on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). In this paper, we discussthe application of SE to the design of next-generation instruments forground-based astronomy and present the ongoing development of SE products forthe GMACS spectrograph, currently in its Conceptual Design phase. SE providesthe means to assist in the management of complex projects, and in the case ofGMACS, to ensure its operational success, maximizing the scientific potentialof GMT.

L-Edge Spectroscopy of Dilute, Radiation-Sensitive Systems Using a  Transition-Edge-Sensor Array

  We present X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-rayscattering (RIXS) measurements on the iron L-edge of 0.5 mM aqueousferricyanide. These measurements demonstrate the ability of high-throughputtransition-edge-sensor (TES) spectrometers to access the rich soft X-ray(100-2000eV) spectroscopy regime for dilute and radiation-sensitive samples.Our low-concentration data are in agreement with high-concentrationmeasurements recorded by conventional grating-based spectrometers. Theseresults show that soft X-ray RIXS spectroscopy acquired by high-throughput TESspectrometers can be used to study the local electronic structure of dilutemetal-centered complexes relevant to biology, chemistry and catalysis. Inparticular, TES spectrometers have a unique ability to characterize frozensolutions of radiation- and temperature-sensitive samples.

Dynamical renormalization group approach to the Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov  equations

  The Altarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equations for the parton distribution functionsare rederived using the dynamical renormalization group approach to quantumkinetics. This method systematically treats the ln Q^2 corrections that arisesin perturbation theory as a renormalization of the parton distribution functionand unambiguously indicates that the strong coupling must be allowed to runwith the scale in the evolution kernel. To leading logarithmic accuracy theevolution equation is Markovian and the logarithmic divergences in theperturbative expansion are identified with the secular divergences (terms thatgrow in time) that emerge in a perturbative treatment of the kinetic equationsin nonequilibrium systems. The resummation of the leading logarithms by theAltarelli-Parisi-Lipatov equation is thus similar to the resummation of theleading secular terms by the Boltzmann kinetic equation.

Multigap Superconductivity in Chiral Noncentrosymmetric  TaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$

  We report the first observation of multigap superconductivity inTaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$. We show TaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$ is a bulk type-II superconductorwith a transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{c}} = 6.00(5)$ K. We presenttransverse-field muon spin relaxation data where the superconducting gap can befit using a two-gap $\left(s+s\right)$-wave model. We also report thezero-field electronic specific heat in the superconducting state that is bestdescribed by the same $\left(s+s\right)$ model providing further evidence ofmultiband behavior in this superconductor. Zero-field muon spin relaxationmeasurements show time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconductingstate. We demonstrate that TaRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$ has an upper critical field of$15.2(1)$ T, which is significantly higher than previously reported and exceedsthe Pauli limit.

MARVELS-1b: A Short-Period, Brown Dwarf Desert Candidate from the  SDSS-III MARVELS Planet Search

  We present a new short-period brown dwarf candidate around the star TYC1240-00945-1. This candidate was discovered in the first year of theMulti-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanets Large-area Survey (MARVELS), whichis part of the third phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), and wedesignate the brown dwarf as MARVELS-1b. MARVELS uses the technique ofdispersed fixed-delay interferometery to simultaneously obtain radial velocitymeasurements for 60 objects per field using a single, custom-built instrumentthat is fiber fed from the SDSS 2.5-m telescope. From our 20 radial velocitymeasurements spread over a ~370 d time baseline, we derive a Keplerian orbitalfit with semi-amplitude K=2.533+/-0.025 km/s, period P=5.8953+/-0.0004 d, andeccentricity consistent with circular. Independent follow-up radial velocitydata confirm the orbit. Adopting a mass of 1.37+/-0.11 M_Sun for the slightlyevolved F9 host star, we infer that the companion has a minimum mass of28.0+/-1.5 M_Jup, a semimajor axis 0.071+/-0.002 AU assuming an edge-on orbit,and is probably tidally synchronized. We find no evidence for coherentinstrinsic variability of the host star at the period of the companion atlevels greater than a few millimagnitudes. The companion has an a prioritransit probability of ~14%. Although we find no evidence for transits, wecannot definitively rule them out for companion radii ~<1 R_Jup.

Signs of Analyticity in Single-Field Inflation

  The analyticity of response functions and scattering amplitudes impliespowerful relations between low-energy observables and the underlyingshort-distance dynamics. These 'IR/UV' relations are rooted in basic physicalprinciples, such as causality and unitarity. In this paper, we seek similarconnections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physicsresponsible for the accelerated expansion. We assume that the inflationarytheory is Lorentz invariant at short distances, but allow for non-relativisticinteractions and a non-trivial speed of propagation at low energies. Focusingon forward scattering, we derive a 'sum rule' which equates a combination oflow-energy parameters to an integral which is sensitive to the high-energybehavior of the theory. While for relativistic amplitudes unitarity issufficient to prove positivity of the sum rule, this is not guaranteed in thenon-relativistic case. We discuss the conditions under which positivity stillapplies, and show that they are satisfied by all known UV completions ofsingle-field inflation. In that case, we obtain a consistency condition forprimordial non-Gaussianity, which constrains the size and the sign of theequilateral four-point function in terms of the amplitude of the three-pointfunction. The resulting bound rules out about half of the parameter space thatis still allowed by current observations. Finding a violation of ourconsistency condition would point towards less conventional theories ofinflation, or violations of basic physical principles.

Reheating the Post Inflationary Universe

  We consider the non-equilibrium evolution of the inflaton field coupled toboth lighter scalars and fermions. The dissipational dynamics of this field isstudied and found to be quite different than that believed in inflationarymodels. In particular, the damping time scale for the expectation value of thezero momentum mode of the inflaton can be much shorter than that given by thesingle particle decay rate when the inflaton amplitudes are large, as inchaotic inflation scenarios. We find that the reheating temperature may departconsiderably from the usual estimates.

New Aspects of Reheating

  The reheating stage in post-inflationary cosmologies is reanalyzed. Newtechniques from non-equilibrium quantum field theory allow a consistentderivation of the equation of motion including the non-linearity of thedynamics. These offer a rationale for the elementary theory of reheating basedon single particle decay which is seen to be valid only in the linear regime ofcoherent oscillations of the scalar field. A new non-perturbative mechanism ofinduced amplification of quantum fluctuations is introduced and studied indetail, both analytically and numerically. This is a non-linear mechanism thatis typically a far more efficient way of transfering energy out of the zeromode and into production of lighter particles than single particle decay.Thermalization is discussed and we estimate the reheating temperature to be ofthe order of the inflaton mass, thus providing a potential solution to thePolonyi and moduli problems.

Phase Transitions out of Equilibrium: domain formation and growth

  We study the dynamics of phase transitions out of equilibrium in weaklycoupled scalar field theories. We consider the case in which there is a rapidsupercooling from an initial symmetric phase in thermal equilibrium attemperature $T_i>T_c$ to a final state at low temperature $T_f \approx 0$. Inparticular we study the formation and growth of correlated domains out ofequilibrium. It is shown that the dynamics of the process of domain formationand growth (spinodal decomposition) cannot be studied in perturbation theory,and a non-perturbative self-consistent Hartree approximation is used to studythe long time evolution. We find in weakly coupled theories that the size ofdomains grow at long times as $\xi_D(t) \approx \sqrt{t\xi(0)}$. For veryweakly coupled theories, their final size is several times the zero temperaturecorrelation length. For strongly coupled theories the final size of the domainsis comparable to the zero temperature correlation length and the transitionproceeds faster.

Electronic transport in iron atomic contacts: from the infinite wire to  realistic geometries

  We present a theoretical study of spin polarized transport in Fe atomiccontacts using a self-consistent tight-binding Hamiltonian in a non-orthogonal$s$, $p$ and $d$ basis set, the spin-polarization being obtained from anon-collinear Stoner-like model and the transmission probability from theFisher-Lee formula. The behaviour of an infinite perfect Fe wire is comparedwith that of an infinite chain presenting geometric defects or magnetic wallsand with that of a finite chain connected to infinite one-dimensional orthree-dimensional leads. In the presence of defects or contacts thetransmission probability of $d$ electrons is much more affected than that of$s$ electrons, in particular, contact effects may suppress some transmissionchannels. It is shown that the behaviour of an infinite wire is never obtainedeven in the limit of long chains connected to electrodes. The introduction ofthe spin-orbit coupling term in the Hamiltonian enables us to calculate theanisotropy of the magneto-resistance. Finally whereas the variation of themagneto-resistance as a function of the magnetization direction is step-likefor an infinite wire, it becomes smooth in the presence of defects or contacts.

Mechanisms in knockout reactions

  We report on the first detailed study of the mechanisms involved in knockoutreactions, via a coincidence measurement of the residue and fast proton inone-proton knockout reactions, using the S800 spectrograph in combination withthe HiRA detector array at the NSCL. Results on the reactions$^9$Be($^9$C,$^8$B+X)Y and $^9$Be($^8$B,$^7$Be+X)Y are presented. They arecompared with theoretical predictions for both the diffraction and strippingreaction mechanisms, as calculated in the eikonal model. The data shows a cleardistinction between the two reaction mechanisms, and the observed respectiveproportions are very well reproduced by the reaction theory. This agreementsupports the results of knockout reaction analyses and their applications tothe spectroscopy of rare isotopes.

Comparative study of the pressure effects on the magnetic penetration  depth in electron- and hole-doped cuprate superconductors

  The effect of pressure on the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$ was testedin the hole-doped superconductor YBa2Cu3O(7-d) and in the electron-doped oneSr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of magnetization measurements. Whereas a large changeof $\lambda$ was found in YBa2Cu3O(7-d), confirming the non-adiabatic characterof the electron-phonon coupling in hole-doped superconductors, the samequantity is not affected by pressure in the electron-doped Sr0.9La0.1CuO2,suggesting a close similarity of the latter to conventional adiabatic BCSsuperconductors. The present results imply a remarkable difference between theelectronic properties of hole-doped cuprates and the electron-dopedSr0.9La0.1CuO2, giving a strong contribution to the long debated asymmetricconsequences of hole- and electron-doping in cuprate superconductors.

The Spitzer Local Volume Legacy (LVL) Global Optical Photometry

  We present the global optical photometry of 246 galaxies in the Local VolumeLegacy (LVL) survey. The full volume-limited sample consists of 258 nearby (D <11 Mpc) galaxies whose absolute B-band magnitude span a range of -9.6 < M_B <-20.7 mag. A composite optical (UBVR) data set is constructed from observedUBVR and SDSS ugriz imaging, where the ugriz magnitudes are transformed intoUBVR. We present photometry within three galaxy apertures defined at UV,optical, and IR wavelengths. Flux comparisons between these apertures revealthat the traditional optical R25 galaxy apertures do not fully encompassextended sources. Using the larger IR apertures we find color-colorrelationships where later-type spiral and irregular galaxies tend to be bluerthan earlier-type galaxies. These data provide the missing optical emissionfrom which future LVL studies can construct the full panchromatic(UV-optical-IR) spectral energy distributions.

Empirical ugri-UBVRc Transformations for Galaxies

  We present empirical color transformations between Sloan Digital Sky Surveyugri and Johnson-Cousins UBVRc photometry for nearby galaxies (D < 11 Mpc). Weuse the Local Volume Legacy (LVL) galaxy sample where there are 90 galaxieswith overlapping observational coverage for these two filter sets. The LVLgalaxy sample consists of normal, non-starbursting galaxies. We also examinehow well the LVL galaxy colors are described by previous transformationsderived from standard calibration stars and model-based galaxy templates. Wefind significant galaxy color scatter around most of the previoustransformation relationships. In addition, the previous transformations showsystematic offsets between transformed and observed galaxy colors which arevisible in observed color-color trends. The LVL-based $galaxy$ transformationsshow no systematic color offsets and reproduce the observed color-color galaxytrends.

Superconducting and normal-state properties of the noncentrosymmetric  superconductor Re6Zr

  We systematically investigate the normal and superconducting properties ofnon-centrosymmetric Re$_{6}$Zr using magnetization, heat capacity, andelectrical resistivity measurements. Resistivity measurements indicateRe$_{6}$Zr has poor metallic behavior and is dominated by disorder. Re$_6$Zrundergoes a superconducting transition at $T_{\mathrm{c}} =\left(6.75\pm0.05\right)$ K. Magnetization measurements give a lower criticalfield, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c1}} = \left(10.3 \pm 0.1\right)$ mT. TheWerthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model is used to approximate the upper criticalfield $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c2}} = \left(11.2 \pm 0.2\right)$ T which is close tothe Pauli limiting field of 12.35 T and which could indicate singlet-tripletmixing. However, low-temperature specific-heat data suggest that Re$_{6}$Zr isan isotropic, fully gapped s-wave superconductor with enhanced electron-phononcoupling. Unusual flux pinning resulting in a peak effect is observed in themagnetization data, indicating an unconventional vortex state.

Gate-Defined Quantum Confinement in InSe-based van der Waals  Heterostructures

  Indium selenide, a post-transition metal chalcogenide, is a noveltwo-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with interesting electronic properties. Itstunable band gap and high electron mobility have already attracted considerableresearch interest. Here we demonstrate strong quantum confinement andmanipulation of single electrons in devices made from few-layer crystals ofInSe using electrostatic gating. We report on gate-controlled quantum dots inthe Coulomb blockade regime as well as one-dimensional quantization in pointcontacts, revealing multiple plateaus. The work represents an importantmilestone in the development of quality devices based on 2D materials and makesInSe a prime candidate for relevant electronic and optoelectronic applications.

Search for Sub-threshold Photoproduction of J/Psi Mesons

  A search was made for sub-threshold $J/\psi$ production from a carbon targetusing a mixed real and quasi-real Bremsstrahlung photon beam with an endpointenergy of 5.76 GeV. No events were observed, which is consistent withpredictions assuming quasi-free production. The results place limits on exoticmechanisms that strongly enhance quasi-free production.

Surges of collective human activity emerge from simple pairwise  correlations

  Human populations exhibit complex behaviors---characterized by long-rangecorrelations and surges in activity---across a range of social, political, andtechnological contexts. Yet it remains unclear where these collective behaviorscome from, or if there even exists a set of unifying principles. Indeed,existing explanations typically rely on context-specific mechanisms, such astraffic jams driven by work schedules or spikes in online traffic induced bysignificant events. However, analogies with statistical mechanics suggest amore general mechanism: that collective patterns can emerge organically fromfine-scale interactions within a population. Here, across four different modesof human activity, we show that the simplest correlations in apopulation---those between pairs of individuals---can yield accuratequantitative predictions for the large-scale behavior of the entire population.To quantify the minimal consequences of pairwise correlations, we employ theprinciple of maximum entropy, making our description equivalent to an Isingmodel whose interactions and external fields are notably calculated from pastobservations of population activity. In addition to providing accuratequantitative predictions, we show that the topology of learned Isinginteractions resembles the network of inter-human communication within apopulation. Together, these results demonstrate that fine-scale correlationscan be used to predict large-scale social behaviors, a perspective that hascritical implications for modeling and resource allocation in humanpopulations.

Splittings of low-lying charmonium masses at the physical point

  We present high-precision results from lattice QCD for the mass splittings ofthe low-lying charmonium states. For the valence charm quark, the calculationuses Wilson-clover quarks in the Fermilab interpretation. The gauge-fieldensembles are generated in the presence of up, down, and strange sea quarks,based on the improved staggered (asqtad) action, and gluon fields, based on theone-loop, tadpole-improved gauge action. We use five lattice spacings and twovalues of the light sea quark mass to extrapolate the results to the physicalpoint. An enlarged set of interpolating operators is used for a variationalanalysis to improve the determination of the energies of the ground states ineach channel. We present and implement a continuum extrapolation within theFermilab interpretation, based on power-counting arguments, and thoroughlydiscuss all sources of systematic uncertainty. We compare our results forvarious mass splittings with their experimental values, namely, the 1Shyperfine splitting, the 1P-1S splitting and the P-wave spin-orbit and tensorsplittings. Given the uncertainty related to the width of the resonances, wefind excellent agreement.

Modeling the Effects of Star Formation Histories on Halpha and  Ultra-Violet Fluxes in Nearby Dwarf Galaxies

  We consider the effects of non-constant star formation histories (SFHs) onHalpha and GALEX far ultra-violet (FUV) star formation rate (SFR) indicators.Under the assumption of a fully populated Chabrier IMF, we compare thedistribution of Halpha-to-FUV flux ratios from ~ 1500 simple, periodic modelSFHs with observations of 185 galaxies from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacysurvey. We find a set of SFH models that are well matched to the data, suchthat more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant SFHs,while low mass systems experience bursts amplitudes of ~ 30 (i.e., an increasein the SFR by a factor of 30 over the SFR during the inter-burst period), burstdurations of tens of Myr, and periods of ~ 250 Myr; these SFHs are broadlyconsistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systemswith lower SFRs. We analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellarmass, R-band surface brightness, Halpha-derived SFR, and blue luminosity, andfind that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. Wefind that our model SFHs are generally able to reproduce both the observedsystematic decline and increased scatter in Halpha-to-FUV ratios toward lowmass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. We also compare ourpredictions with those from the Integrated Galactic IMF theory with a constantSFR. We find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observedratios, only the time variable SFH models are capable of producing the observedpopulation of low mass galaxies ($M_{*}$ < 10$^{7}$ Msun) with normalHalpha-to-FUV ratios. These results demonstrate that a variable IMF alone hasdifficulty explaining the observed scatter in the Halpha-to-FUV ratios. Weconclude by considering the limitations of the model SFHs, and discuss the useof additional empirical constraints to improve future SFH modeling efforts.

Direct Oxygen Abundances for Low Luminosity LVL Galaxies

  We present MMT spectroscopic observations of HII regions in 42 low luminositygalaxies in the LVL. For 31 galaxies, we measured the temperature sensitive [OIII] line at a strength of 4 sigma or greater, and thus determine direct oxygenabundances. Our results provide the first direct estimates of oxygen abundancefor 19 galaxies. Oxygen abundances were compared to B-band and 4.5 micronluminosities and stellar masses in order to characterize theluminosity-metallicity (L-Z) and mass-metallicity (M-Z) relationships atlow-luminosity.  We present and analyze a "Combined Select" sample composed of 38 objects(drawn from our parent sample and the literature) with direct oxygen abundancesand reliable distance determinations (TRGB or Ceph). Consistent with previousstudies, the B-band and 4.5 micron L-Z relationships were found to be12+log(O/H)=(6.27+/-0.21)+(-0.11+/-0.01)M_B and12+log(O/H)=(6.10+/-0.21)+(-0.10+/-0.01)M_[4.5] (sigma=0.15 and 0.14). For thissample, we derive a M-Z relationship of12+log(O/H)=(5.61+/-0.24)+(0.29+/-0.03)log(M*), which agrees with previousstudies; however, the dispersion (sigma=0.15) is not significantly lower thanthat of the L-Z relationships. Because of the low dispersions in theserelationships, if an accurate distance is available, the luminosity of alow-luminosity galaxy is often a better indicator of metallicity than thatderived using certain strong-line methods, so significant departures from theL-Z relationships may indicate that caution is prudent in such cases. We alsorevisit the 70/160 micron color metallicity relationship.  Additionally, we examine N/O abundance trends with respect to oxygenabundance and B-V color. We find a positive correlation between N/O ratio andB-V color for 0.05\lesssimB-V\lesssim0.75:log(N/O)=(1.18+/-0.9)x(B-V)+(-1.92+/-0.08), with a dispersion of sigma=0.14,that is in agreement with previous studies.

A Be star with a low nitrogen abundance in the SMC cluster NGC330

  High-resolution UVES/VLT spectra of B12, an extreme pole-on Be star in theSMC cluster NGC330, have been analysed using non-LTE model atmospheres toobtain its chemical composition relative to the SMC standard star AV304. Wefind a general underabundance of metals which can be understood in terms of anextra contribution to the stellar continuum due to emission from a disk whichwe estimate to be at the ~25% level. When this is corrected for, the nitrogenabundance for B12 shows no evidence of enhancement by rotational mixing as hasbeen found in other non-Be B-type stars in NGC330, and is inconsistent withevolutionary models which include the effects of rotational mixing. A second Bestar, NGC330-B17, is also shown to have no detectable nitrogen lines. Possibleexplanations for the lack of rotational mixing in these rapidly rotating starsare discussed, one promising solution being the possibility that magneticfields might inhibit rotational mixing.

Equilibrium Properties of Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Plasticity

  A theory of temporally asymmetric Hebb (TAH) rules which depress orpotentiate synapses depending upon whether the postsynaptic cell fires beforeor after the presynaptic one is presented. Using the Fokker-Planck formalism,we show that the equilibrium synaptic distribution induced by such rules ishighly sensitive to the manner in which bounds on the allowed range of synapticvalues are imposed. In a biologically plausible multiplicative model, we findthat the synapses in asynchronous networks reach a distribution that isinvariant to the firing rates of either the pre- or post-synaptic cells. Whenthese cells are temporally correlated, the synaptic strength varies smoothlywith the degree and phase of synchrony between the cells.

Dendritic flux patterns in MgB2 films

  Magneto-opitcal studies of a c-oriented epitaxial MgB2 film with criticalcurrent density 10^7 A/cm^2 demonstrate a breakdown of the critical state attemperatures below 10 K [cond-mat/0104113]. Instead of conventional uniform andgradual flux penetration in an applied magnetic field, we observe an abruptinvasion of complex dendritic structures. When the applied field subsequentlydecreases, similar dendritic structures of the return flux penetrate the film.The static and dynamic properties of the dendrites are discussed.

Current-induced dendritic magnetic instability in superconducting MgB2  films

  Magneto-optical imaging reveals that in superconducting films of MgB2 atransport current creates avalanche-like flux dynamics where highly branchingdendritic penetration patterns are formed. The instability is triggered whenthe current exceeds a threshold value, and the superconductor, shaped as a longstrip, is initially in the critical state. The instability exists up to 19 K,which is a much wider temperature range than in previous experiments, wheredendrites were formed by applying a magnetic field. The instability is believedto be of thermo-magnetic origin indicating that thermal stabilization maybecome crucial in applications of MgB2.

Local threshold field for dendritic instability in superconducting MgB2  films

  Using magneto-optical imaging the phenomenon of dendritic flux penetration insuperconducting films was studied. Flux dendrites were abruptly formed in a 300nm thick film of MgB2 by applying a perpendicular magnetic field. Detailedmeasurements of flux density distributions show that there exists a localthreshold field controlling the nucleation and termination of the dendriticgrowth. At 4 K the local threshold field is close to 12 mT in this sample,where the critical current density is 10^7 A/cm^2. The dendritic instability inthin films is believed to be of thermo-magnetic origin, but the existence of alocal threshold field, and its small value are features that distinctlycontrast the thermo-magnetic instability (flux jumps) in bulk superconductors.

Interplay of dendritic avalanches and gradual flux penetration in  superconducting MgB2 films

  Magneto-optical imaging was used to study a zero-field-cooled MgB2 film at9.6K where in a slowly increasing field the flux penetrates by abrupt formationof large dendritic structures. Simultaneously, a gradual flux penetration takesplace, eventually covering the dendrites, and a detailed analysis of thisprocess is reported. We find an anomalously high gradient of the flux densityacross a dendrite branch, and a peak value that decreases as the applied fieldgoes up. This unexpected behaviour is reproduced by flux creep simulationsbased on the non-local field-current relation in the perpendicular geometry.The simulations also provide indirect evidence that flux dendrites are formedat an elevated local temperature, consistent with a thermo-magnetic mechanismof the instability

Mesoscopic flux jumps in MgB2 films visualized by magneto-optical  imaging

  We report on the first spatially resolved observation of mesoscopic fluxjumps in superconducting films. Magneto-optical imaging was used to visualizethe flux penetration in MgB2 films subjected to a slowly varying perpendicularfield. Below 10 K, flux jumps with typical size 10-20 microns and regular shapeare found to occur at random locations along the flux front. The total numberof vortices participating in one jump is varying between 50 and 10000.Simultaneously, big dendritic jumps with dimensions comparable to the samplesize (10^6-10^8 vortices) are also found in this temperature range. We believethat both types of jumps result from thermo-magnetic instability.

Size of flux jumps in superconducting films

  Magneto-optical imaging is used to visualize vortex avalanches in MgB2 filmsat 4K. Avalanches ranging from 50 to 50000 vortices were detected. The sizedistribution function has a clear peak whose position moves towards largersizes as the applied field increases. This field dependence as well asvariation of flux density profile during an avalanche are well described by aproposed model assuming a thermal origin of the avalanches. The model is basedon the adiabatic approach and takes into account nonlocal electrodynamics inthin superconductors. The threshold field for thermal avalanches is predictedto be much smaller than that for thick superconductors, in agreement with theexperiment.

Evidence of metallic clustering in annealed Ga1-xMnxAs from atypical  scaling behavior of the anomalous Hall coefficient

  We report on the anomalous Hall coefficient and longitudinal resistivityscaling relationships on a series of annealed Ga1-xMnxAs epilayers (x~0.055).As-grown samples exhibit scaling parameter n of ~ 1. Near the optimal annealingtemperature, we find n ~ 2 to be consistent with recent theories on theintrinsic origins of anomalous Hall Effect in Ga1-xMnxAs. For annealingtemperatures far above the optimum, we note n > 3, similar behavior to certaininhomogeneous systems. This observation of atypical behavior agrees well withcharacteristic features attributable to spherical resonance from metallicinclusions from optical spectroscopy measurements.

Interplay between carrier and impurity concentrations in annealed  Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As intrinsic anomalous Hall Effect

  Investigating the scaling behavior of annealed Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As anomalousHall coefficients, we note a universal crossover regime where the scalingbehavior changes from quadratic to linear, attributed to the anomalous HallEffect intrinsic and extrinsic origins, respectively. Furthermore, measuredanomalous Hall conductivities when properly scaled by carrier concentrationremain constant, equal to theoretically predicated values, spanning nearly adecade in conductivity as well as over 100 K in T$_{C}$. Both the qualitativeand quantitative agreement confirms the validity of new equations of motionincluding the Berry phase contributions as well as tunablility of the intrinsicanomalous Hall Effect.

Incommensurate spin-density wave order in electron-doped BaFe2As2  superconductors

  Neutron diffraction studies of Ba(Fe[1-x]Co[x])2As2 reveal that commensurateantiferromagnetic order gives way to incommensurate magnetic order for Cocompositions between 0.056 < x < 0.06. The incommensurability has the form of asmall transverse splitting (0, +-e, 0) from the nominal commensurateantiferromagnetic propagation vector Q[AFM] = (1, 0, 1) (in orthorhombicnotation) where e = 0.02-0.03 and is composition dependent. The results areconsistent with the formation of a spin-density wave driven by Fermi surfacenesting of electron and hole pockets and confirm the itinerant nature ofmagnetism in the iron arsenide superconductors.

Mesophase formation in a system of top-shaped hard molecules: Density  functional theory and Monte Carlo simulation

  We present the phase diagram of a system of mesogenic top-shaped moleculesbased on the Parsons- Lee density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulation.The molecules are modeled as a hard spherocylinder with a hard sphere embeddedin its center. The stability of five different phases is studied, namely,isotropic, nematic, smectic A, smectic C, and columnar phases. The positionallyordered phases are investigated only for the case of parallel alignment. It isfound that the central spherical unit destabilizes the nematic with respect tothe isotropic phase, while increasing the length of the cylinder has theopposite effect. Also, the central hard sphere has a strong destabilizingeffect on the smectic A phase, due the inefficient packing of the moleculesinto layers. For large hard sphere units the smectic A phase is completelyreplaced by a smectic C structure. The columnar phase is first stabilized withincreasing diameter of the central unit, but for very large hard sphere unitsit becomes less stable again. The density functional results are in goodagreement with the simulations.

Learning Discriminative Metrics via Generative Models and Kernel  Learning

  Metrics specifying distances between data points can be learned in adiscriminative manner or from generative models. In this paper, we show how tounify generative and discriminative learning of metrics via a kernel learningframework. Specifically, we learn local metrics optimized from parametricgenerative models. These are then used as base kernels to construct a globalkernel that minimizes a discriminative training criterion. We consider bothlinear and nonlinear combinations of local metric kernels. Our empiricalresults show that these combinations significantly improve performance onclassification tasks. The proposed learning algorithm is also very efficient,achieving order of magnitude speedup in training time compared to previousdiscriminative baseline methods.

Weak lensing analysis of RXC J2248.7-4431

  We present a weak lensing analysis of the cluster of galaxies RXCJ2248.7-4431, a massive system at z=0.3475 with prominent strong lensingfeatures covered by the HST/CLASH survey (Postman et al. 2012). Based on UBVRIZimaging from the WFI camera at the MPG/ESO-2.2m telescope, we measurephotometric redshifts and shapes of background galaxies. The cluster isdetected as a mass peak at 5sigma significance. Its density can be parametrisedas an NFW profile (Navarro et al. 1996) with two free parameters, the massM_200m=(33.1+9.6-6.8)x10^14Msol and concentration c_200m=2.6+1.5-1.0. Wediscover a second cluster inside the field of view at a photometric redshift ofz~0.6, with an NFW mass of M_200m=(4.0+3.7-2.6)x10^14Msol.

An Adversarial Interpretation of Information-Theoretic Bounded  Rationality

  Recently, there has been a growing interest in modeling planning withinformation constraints. Accordingly, an agent maximizes a regularized expectedutility known as the free energy, where the regularizer is given by theinformation divergence from a prior to a posterior policy. While this approachcan be justified in various ways, including from statistical mechanics andinformation theory, it is still unclear how it relates to decision-makingagainst adversarial environments. This connection has previously been suggestedin work relating the free energy to risk-sensitive control and to extensiveform games. Here, we show that a single-agent free energy optimization isequivalent to a game between the agent and an imaginary adversary. Theadversary can, by paying an exponential penalty, generate costs that diminishthe decision maker's payoffs. It turns out that the optimal strategy of theadversary consists in choosing costs so as to render the decision makerindifferent among its choices, which is a definining property of a Nashequilibrium, thus tightening the connection between free energy optimizationand game theory.

Belief Flows of Robust Online Learning

  This paper introduces a new probabilistic model for online learning whichdynamically incorporates information from stochastic gradients of an arbitraryloss function. Similar to probabilistic filtering, the model maintains aGaussian belief over the optimal weight parameters. Unlike traditional Bayesianupdates, the model incorporates a small number of gradient evaluations atlocations chosen using Thompson sampling, making it computationally tractable.The belief is then transformed via a linear flow field which optimally updatesthe belief distribution using rules derived from information theoreticprinciples. Several versions of the algorithm are shown using differentconstraints on the flow field and compared with conventional online learningalgorithms. Results are given for several classification tasks includinglogistic regression and multilayer neural networks.

Linear Readout of Object Manifolds

  Objects are represented in sensory systems by continuous manifolds due tosensitivity of neuronal responses to changes in physical features such aslocation, orientation, and intensity. What makes certain sensoryrepresentations better suited for invariant decoding of objects by downstreamnetworks? We present a theory that characterizes the ability of a linearreadout network, the perceptron, to classify objects from variable neuralresponses. We show how the readout perceptron capacity depends on thedimensionality, size, and shape of the object manifolds in its input neuralrepresentation.
