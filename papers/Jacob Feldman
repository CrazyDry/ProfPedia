Noise sensitivity on continuous products: an answer to an old question  of J. Feldman

  A relation between sigma-additivity and linearizability, conjectured by JacobFeldman in 1971 for continuous products of probability spaces, is establishedby relating both notions to a recent idea of noise stability/sensitivity.

Leo and me

  I arrived in Berkeley in 1957, at which time Leo was an Acting AssistantProfessor of Mathematics here. He had recently proven the "individual ergodictheorem of information theory"---a triumph---and since this was becomingcentral to my own interests, it would have been natural for us to worktogether. However, Leo's interests shifted to more applied work, specificallystatistics, and he soon moved to UCLA. So we never became collaborators, but wedid became good friends, especially after 1980 when he returned to Berkeley asa Professor of Statistics.

Noise as a Boolean algebra of sigma-fields. III. An old question of  Jacob Feldman

  The noise-type completion C of a noise-type Boolean algebra B is generallynot the same as the closure of B. As shown in Part I (Introduction, Theorem 2),C consists of all complemented elements of the closure. It appears that C isthe whole closure if and only if B is classical (as defined in Part II, Sect.1a), which is the main result of this Part III.

A Search for B+ -> tau+ nu Recoiling Against B- -> D0 l- nu X

  We present a search for the decay $B^+ \to \ell^+ \nu_{\ell}$ ($\ell =e,\mu\tau$) in $(458.9 \pm 5.1) \times 10^6$ $B\bar{B}$ pairs recorded with theBABAR detector at the PEP-II B-Factory. We search for these B decays in asample of $B^+B^-$ events where one $B$-meson is reconstructed as $B^- \to D^0\ell^- \nu X$. Using the method of Feldman and Cousins, we obtain$\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to \tau^+ \nu) = (1.7 \pm 0.8 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-4}$, whichexcludes zero at $2.3\sigma$. We interpret the central value in the context ofthe Standard Model and find the B meson decay constant to be $f^2_B = (62 \pm31) \times 10^3 \mathrm{MeV}^2$. We find no evidence for $B^+ \to e^+ \nu_{e}$and $B^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$ and set upper limits at the 90% C.L.$\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to e^+ \nu_{e}) < 0.8 \times 10^{-5}$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}) < 1.1 \times 10^{-5}$.

Superoperator Analysis of Entanglement in a Four-Qubit Cluster State

  In this paper we utilize superoperator formalism to explore the entanglementevolution of four-qubit cluster states in a number of decohering environments.A four-qubit cluster state is a resource for the performance of an arbitrarysingle logical qubit rotation via measurement based cluster state quantumcomputation. We are specifically interested in the relationship betweenentanglement evolution and the fidelity with which the arbitrary single logicalqubit rotation can be implemented in the presence of decoherence as this willhave important experimental ramifications. We also note the exhibition ofentanglement sudden death (ESD) and ask how severely its onset affects theutilization of the cluster state as a means of implementing an arbitrary singlelogical qubit rotation.

Toward a Taxonomy and Computational Models of Abnormalities in Images

  The human visual system can spot an abnormal image, and reason about whatmakes it strange. This task has not received enough attention in computervision. In this paper we study various types of atypicalities in images in amore comprehensive way than has been done before. We propose a new dataset ofabnormal images showing a wide range of atypicalities. We design human subjectexperiments to discover a coarse taxonomy of the reasons for abnormality. Ourexperiments reveal three major categories of abnormality: object-centric,scene-centric, and contextual. Based on this taxonomy, we propose acomprehensive computational model that can predict all different types ofabnormality in images and outperform prior arts in abnormality recognition.

The Role of Typicality in Object Classification: Improving The  Generalization Capacity of Convolutional Neural Networks

  Deep artificial neural networks have made remarkable progress in differenttasks in the field of computer vision. However, the empirical analysis of thesemodels and investigation of their failure cases has received attentionrecently. In this work, we show that deep learning models cannot generalize toatypical images that are substantially different from training images. This isin contrast to the superior generalization ability of the visual system in thehuman brain. We focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as thestate-of-the-art models in object recognition and classification; investigatethis problem in more detail, and hypothesize that training CNN models sufferfrom unstructured loss minimization. We propose computational models to improvethe generalization capacity of CNNs by considering how typical a training imagelooks like. By conducting an extensive set of experiments we show thatinvolving a typicality measure can improve the classification results on a newset of images by a large margin. More importantly, this significant improvementis achieved without fine-tuning the CNN model on the target image set.

Synthetic Depth-of-Field with a Single-Camera Mobile Phone

  Shallow depth-of-field is commonly used by photographers to isolate a subjectfrom a distracting background. However, standard cell phone cameras cannotproduce such images optically, as their short focal lengths and small aperturescapture nearly all-in-focus images. We present a system to computationallysynthesize shallow depth-of-field images with a single mobile camera and asingle button press. If the image is of a person, we use a person segmentationnetwork to separate the person and their accessories from the background. Ifavailable, we also use dense dual-pixel auto-focus hardware, effectively a2-sample light field with an approximately 1 millimeter baseline, to compute adense depth map. These two signals are combined and used to render a defocusedimage. Our system can process a 5.4 megapixel image in 4 seconds on a mobilephone, is fully automatic, and is robust enough to be used by non-experts. Themodular nature of our system allows it to degrade naturally in the absence of adual-pixel sensor or a human subject.

The Large Observatory For x-ray Timing

  The Large Observatory For x-ray Timing (LOFT) was studied within ESA M3Cosmic Vision framework and participated in the final down-selection for alaunch slot in 2022-2024. Thanks to the unprecedented combination of effectivearea and spectral resolution of its main instrument, LOFT will study thebehaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitationalfield in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes andneutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutronstars. The science payload is based on a Large Area Detector (LAD, 10 m 2effective area, 2-30 keV, 240 eV spectral resolution, 1 deg collimated field ofview) and a WideField Monitor (WFM, 2-50 keV, 4 steradian field of view, 1arcmin source location accuracy, 300 eV spectral resolution). The WFM isequipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. GRB) localization. Thetrigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30s from discovery. In this paper we present the status of the mission at the endof its Phase A study.
