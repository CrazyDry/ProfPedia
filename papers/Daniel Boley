Random Walk Laplacian and Network Centrality Measures

  Random walks over directed graphs are used to model activities in manydomains, such as social networks, influence propagation, and Bayesian graphicalmodels. They are often used to compute the importance or centrality ofindividual nodes according to a variety of different criteria. Here we show howthe pseudoinverse of the "random walk" Laplacian can be used to quickly computemeasures such as the average number of visits to a given node and variouscentrality and betweenness measures for individual nodes, both for the networkin general and in the case a subset of nodes is to be avoided. We show thatwith a single matrix inversion it is possible to rapidly compute many suchquantities.

Local Linear Convergence of ISTA and FISTA on the LASSO Problem

  We establish local linear convergence bounds for the ISTA and FISTAiterations on the model LASSO problem. We show that FISTA can be viewed as anaccelerated ISTA process. Using a spectral analysis, we show that, when closeenough to the solution, both iterations converge linearly, but FISTA slows downcompared to ISTA, making it advantageous to switch to ISTA toward the end ofthe iteration processs. We illustrate the results with some synthetic numericalexamples.

Incremental Computation of Pseudo-Inverse of Laplacian: Theory and  Applications

  A divide-and-conquer based approach for computing the Moore-Penrosepseudo-inverse of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix $(\bb L^+)$ of a simple,undirected graph is proposed. % The nature of the underlying sub-problems isstudied in detail by means of an elegant interplay between $\bb L^+$ and theeffective resistance distance $(\Omega)$. Closed forms are provided for a novel{\em two-stage} process that helps compute the pseudo-inverse incrementally.Analogous scalar forms are obtained for the converse case, that of structuralregress, which entails the breaking up of a graph into disjoint componentsthrough successive edge deletions. The scalar forms in both cases, showabsolute element-wise independence at all stages, thus suggesting potentialparallelizability. Analytical and experimental results are presented fordynamic (time-evolving) graphs as well as large graphs in general (representingreal-world networks). An order of magnitude reduction in computational time isachieved for dynamic graphs; while in the general case, our approach performsbetter in practice than the standard methods, even though the worst casetheoretical complexities may remain the same: an important contribution withconsequences to the study of online social networks.

Random Walk Fundamental Tensor and Its Applications to Network Analysis

  We first present a comprehensive review of various random walk metrics usedin the literature and express them in a consistent framework. We then introducefundamental tensor -- a generalization of the well-known fundamental matrix --and show that classical random walk metrics can be derived from it in a unifiedmanner. We provide a collection of useful relations for random walk metricsthat are useful and insightful for network studies. To demonstrate theusefulness and efficacy of the proposed fundamental tensor in network analysis,we present four important applications: 1) unification of network centralitymeasures, 2) characterization of (generalized) network articulation points, 3)identification of network most influential nodes, and 4) fast computation ofnetwork reachability after failures.

Avoidance Markov Metrics and Node Pivotality Ranking

  We introduce the avoidance Markov metrics and theories which provide moreflexibility in the design of random walk and impose new conditions on the walkto avoid (or transit) a specific node (or a set of nodes) before the stoppingcriteria. These theories help with applications that cannot be modeled byclassical Markov chains and require more flexibility and intricacy in theirmodeling. Specifically, we use them for the pivotality ranking of the nodes ina network reachabilities. More often than not, it is not sufficient simply toknow whether a source node $s$ can reach a target node $t$ in the network andadditional information associated with reachability, such as how long or howmany possible ways node $s$ may take to reach node $t$, is required. In thispaper, we analyze the pivotality of the nodes which capture how pivotal a rolethat a node $k$ or a subset of nodes $S$ may play in the reachability from node$s$ to node $t$ in a given network. Through some synthetic and real-worldnetwork examples, we show that these metrics build a powerful ranking tool forthe nodes based on their pivotality in the reachability.

Mining Novel Multivariate Relationships in Time Series Data Using  Correlation Networks

  In many domains, there is significant interest in capturing novelrelationships between time series that represent activities recorded atdifferent nodes of a highly complex system. In this paper, we introducemultipoles, a novel class of linear relationships between more than two timeseries. A multipole is a set of time series that have strong linear dependenceamong themselves, with the requirement that each time series makes asignificant contribution to the linear dependence. We demonstrate that mostinteresting multipoles can be identified as cliques of negative correlations ina correlation network. Such cliques are typically rare in a real-worldcorrelation network, which allows us to find almost all multipoles efficientlyusing a clique-enumeration approach. Using our proposed framework, wedemonstrate the utility of multipoles in discovering new physical phenomena intwo scientific domains: climate science and neuroscience. In particular, wediscovered several multipole relationships that are reproducible in multipleother independent datasets and lead to novel domain insights.

An End-to-End Deep Learning Histochemical Scoring System for Breast  Cancer Tissue Microarray

  One of the methods for stratifying different molecular classes of breastcancer is the Nottingham Prognostic Index Plus (NPI+) which uses breast cancerrelevant biomarkers to stain tumour tissues prepared on tissue microarray(TMA). To determine the molecular class of the tumour, pathologists will haveto manually mark the nuclei activity biomarkers through a microscope and use asemi-quantitative assessment method to assign a histochemical score (H-Score)to each TMA core. Manually marking positively stained nuclei is a timeconsuming, imprecise and subjective process which will lead to inter-observerand intra-observer discrepancies. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deeplearning system which directly predicts the H-Score automatically. Our systemimitates the pathologists' decision process and uses one fully convolutionalnetwork (FCN) to extract all nuclei region (tumour and non-tumour), a secondFCN to extract tumour nuclei region, and a multi-column convolutional neuralnetwork which takes the outputs of the first two FCNs and the stain intensitydescription image as input and acts as the high-level decision making mechanismto directly output the H-Score of the input TMA image. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that takes a TMA image as inputand directly outputs a clinical score. We will present experimental resultswhich demonstrate that the H-Scores predicted by our model have very high andstatistically significant correlation with experienced pathologists' scores andthat the H-Score discrepancy between our algorithm and the pathologists is onpar with the inter-subject discrepancy between the pathologists.
