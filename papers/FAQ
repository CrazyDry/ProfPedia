Semi-Automatically Extracting FAQs to Improve Accessibility of Software  Development Knowledge

  Frequently asked questions (FAQs) are a popular way to document softwaredevelopment knowledge. As creating such documents is expensive, this paperpresents an approach for automatically extracting FAQs from sources of softwaredevelopment discussion, such as mailing lists and Internet forums, by combiningtechniques of text mining and natural language processing. We apply theapproach to popular mailing lists and carry out a survey among softwaredevelopers to show that it is able to extract high-quality FAQs that may befurther improved by experts.

On Functional Aggregate Queries with Additive Inequalities

  Motivated by fundamental applications in databases and relational machinelearning, we formulate and study the problem of answering functional aggregatequeries (FAQ) in which some of the input factors are defined by a collection ofadditive inequalities between variables. We refer to these queries as FAQ-AIfor short.  To answer FAQ-AI in the Boolean semiring, we define relaxed treedecompositions and relaxed submodular and fractional hypertree widthparameters. We show that an extension of the InsideOut algorithm usingChazelle's geometric data structure for solving the semigroup range searchproblem can answer Boolean FAQ-AI in time given by these new width parameters.This new algorithm achieves lower complexity than known solutions for FAQ-AI.It also recovers some known results in database query answering.  Our second contribution is a relaxation of the set of polymatroids that givesrise to the counting version of the submodular width, denoted by #subw. Thisnew width is sandwiched between the submodular and the fractional hypertreewidths. Any FAQ and FAQ-AI over one semiring can be answered in timeproportional to #subw and respectively to the relaxed version of #subw.  We present three applications of our FAQ-AI framework to relational machinelearning: k-means clustering, training linear support vector machines, andtraining models using non-polynomial loss. These optimization problems can besolved over a database asymptotically faster than computing the join of thedatabase relations.

FAQ about the "contextual objectivity" point of view

  We discuss some Frequently Asked Questions about the ``contextualobjectivity" point of view on quantum mechanics introduced in two previouspreprints quant-ph/0012122 and quant-ph/0111154.

FAQ: Questions Asked Frequently

  We define and study the Functional Aggregate Query (FAQ) problem, whichencompasses many frequently asked questions in constraint satisfaction,databases, matrix operations, probabilistic graphical models and logic. This isour main conceptual contribution.  We then present a simple algorithm called "InsideOut" to solve this generalproblem. InsideOut is a variation of the traditional dynamic programmingapproach for constraint programming based on variable elimination. Ourvariation adds a couple of simple twists to basic variable elimination in orderto deal with the generality of FAQ, to take full advantage of Grohe and Marx'sfractional edge cover framework, and of the analysis of recent worst-caseoptimal relational join algorithms.  As is the case with constraint programming and graphical model inference, tomake InsideOut run efficiently we need to solve an optimization problem tocompute an appropriate 'variable ordering'. The main technical contribution ofthis work is a precise characterization of when a variable ordering is'semantically equivalent' to the variable ordering given by the input FAQexpression. Then, we design an approximation algorithm to find an equivalentvariable ordering that has the best 'fractional FAQ-width'. Our results imply ahost of known and a few new results in graphical model inference, matrixoperations, relational joins, and logic.  We also briefly explain how recent algorithms on beyond worst-case analysisfor joins and those for solving SAT and #SAT can be viewed as variableelimination to solve FAQ over compactly represented input functions.

The FIRST-APM QSOs Survey in the SBS sky region

  The main goal of the FIRST-APM QSO Survey (FAQS) survey is to compile themost complete sample of Bright QSOs, located in the well optically investigatedarea of the sky covered by the Second Byurakan Survey (SBS). We do that throughthe combination of both radio and optical surveys, down to the magnitude limitB<18.5. We report here the first results of our ongoing study, that is basedupon the cross-identification of the FIRST radio catalog and the AutomatedPlate Measuring Machine (APM) optical catalog. The overlapping sky area betweenthe FIRST and the SBS surveys is about 700 sq. deg. Our compiled list ofsources for this overlapping region contains ~400 quasar candidates brighterthan B=18.5. Of which, about 90 objects are already spectroscopicallyclassified. These objects have been discovered maynly by the SBS survey. During1999, we have carried out spectroscopic observations for more than 100 FAQSobjects with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Astrophysical Observatory(GHO). So far, in the studied subsample, we have found 33 new QSOs, 2 SeyfertGalaxies, 15 emission line galaxies, 1 BL Lac, and 45 high galactic latitudestars. Amongst the 33 QSOs, we have found two broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs,namely, FAQS 151113.7+490557 and FAQS 161744.4+515054. These two BAL QSOs areradio-loud, and have radio-to-optical flux ratios (log R) with values of 1.1and 2.5 respectively. The last object being the brightest radio-loud BAL QSOknown, with a flux density of 99.8 mJy at 1.4 Ghz.

The FIRST-APM QSO survey (FAQS) in the SBS Region. Preliminary Results

  The main goal of the FIRST-APM QSO Survey (FAQS) survey is to compile themost complete sample of Bright QSOs, located in the area covered by the SecondByurakan Survey (SBS). Here we report the first results of an ongoing studybased on the cross-identification of the FIRST radio catalog and the APMoptical catalog. The overlapping sky area between FIRST and SBS is about 700deg$^{2}$. The compiled list of sources for this overlapping region contains$\sim 400$ quasar candidates brighter than $B=18\fm5$. About 90 objects werealready spectroscopically classified. During 1999-2000, we observedspectroscopically more than 150 FAQS objects with the 2.1m telescope of theGuillermo Haro Observatory (GHO).We have found 51 new QSOs (4 BAL QSOs), 13Seyfert Galaxies (5 NLSy1's), 23 emission line galaxies, 3 BL Lac objects and57 stars.

Frozen time in hyperbolic spacetime motion

  According to the Lorentz transformation and clearly seen from the Minkowskidiagram, hyperbolic spacetime motion of a test object relative to a stationaryreference frame can be performed in a specific way such that time becomesfrozen in the moving frame of the test object. In that case, time can bearranged to become frozen even at moderate relativistic velocities, in contrastto the minute traditional relativistic time dilation at such velocities. Anappendix gives a simple illustration in Minkowski form of how time in a framein hyperbolic motion can become frozen to a complete standstill relative to astationary frame. (Published in Phys. Scr. 84 (2011) 035004)  In addition to the paper, the arXiv file also contains a discussion ofFrequently Asked Questions from readers. Further questions not adequately dealtwith in the existing FAQ are welcome.

Tractable Graph Matching via Soft Seeding

  The graph matching problem aims to discover a latent correspondence betweenthe vertex sets of two observed graphs. This problem has proven to be quitechallenging, with few satisfying methods that are computationally tractable andwidely applicable. The FAQ algorithm has proven to have good performance onbenchmark problems and works with a indefinite relaxation of the problem. Dueto the indefinite relaxation, FAQ is not guaranteed to find the global maximum.However, if prior information is known about the true correspondence, this canbe leveraged to initialize the algorithm near the truth. We show that givencertain properties of this initial matrix, with high probability the FAQalgorithm will converge in two steps to the truth under a flexible model forpairs of random graphs. Importantly, this result implies that there will be nolocal optima near the global optima, providing a method to assess performance.

Juggling Functions Inside a Database

  We define and study the Functional Aggregate Query (FAQ) problem, whichcaptures common computational tasks across a very wide range of domainsincluding relational databases, logic, matrix and tensor computation,probabilistic graphical models, constraint satisfaction, and signal processing.Simply put, an FAQ is a declarative way of defining a new function from adatabase of input functions.  We present "InsideOut", a dynamic programming algorithm, to evaluate an FAQ.The algorithm rewrites the input query into a set of easier-to-compute FAQsub-queries. Each sub-query is then evaluated using a worst-case optimalrelational join algorithm. The topic of designing algorithms to optimallyevaluate the classic multiway join problem has seen exciting developments inthe past few years. Our framework tightly connects these new ideas in databasetheory with a vast number of application areas in a coherent manner, showingpotentially that a good database engine can be a general-purpose constraintsolver, relational data store, graphical model inference engine, andmatrix/tensor computation processor all at once.  The InsideOut algorithm is very simple, as shall be described in this paper.Yet, in spite of solving an extremely general problem, its runtime either is asgood as or improves upon the best known algorithm for the applications that FAQspecializes to. These corollaries include computational tasks in graphicalmodel inference, matrix/tensor operations, relational joins, and logic. Betteryet, InsideOut can be used within any database engine, because it is basicallya principled way of rewriting queries. Indeed, it is already part of theLogicBlox database engine, helping efficiently answer traditional databasequeries, graphical model inference queries, and train a large class of machinelearning models inside the database itself.

Fast Approximate Quadratic Programming for Large (Brain) Graph Matching

  Quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) arise in a wide variety of domains,ranging from operations research to graph theory to computer vision toneuroscience. In the age of big data, graph valued data is becoming moreprominent, and with it, a desire to run algorithms on ever larger graphs.Because QAP is NP-hard, exact algorithms are intractable. Approximatealgorithms necessarily employ an accuracy/efficiency trade-off. We developed afast approximate quadratic assignment algorithm (FAQ). FAQ finds a local optimain (worst case) time cubic in the number of vertices, similar to otherapproximate QAP algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm isfaster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80% of the suite of QAPbenchmarks, compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying thealgorithms to our motivating example, matching C. elegans connectomes(brain-graphs), we find that FAQ achieves the optimal performance in recordtime, whereas none of the others even find the optimum.

  We outline the basic ideas and techniques underpinning the simulation ofstochastic differential equations. In particular we focus on strong simulationand its context. We also provide illustratory examples and sample matlabalgorithms for the reader to use and follow.

'Which Multiverse?': Some FAQ

  Recently, we pointed out the possible inconsistency in the very foundationsof the Everett MWI (or a Multiverse) theory. Here, we place some emphasis onthe very basic notions underlying our conclusion yet motivated by certain,recently raised clever observations in this regard.

FAQ-based Question Answering via Word Alignment

  In this paper, we propose a novel word-alignment-based method to solve theFAQ-based question answering task. First, we employ a neural network model tocalculate question similarity, where the word alignment between two questionsis used for extracting features. Second, we design a bootstrap-based featureextraction method to extract a small set of effective lexical features. Third,we propose a learning-to-rank algorithm to train parameters more suitable forthe ranking tasks. Experimental results, conducted on three languages (English,Spanish and Japanese), demonstrate that the question similarity model is moreeffective than baseline systems, the sparse features bring 5% improvements ontop-1 accuracy, and the learning-to-rank algorithm works significantly betterthan the traditional method. We further evaluate our method on the answersentence selection task. Our method outperforms all the previous systems on thestandard TREC data set.

Mass of perfect fluid black shells

  The spherically symmetric singular perfect fluid shells are considered forthe case of their radii being equal to the event horizon (the black shells). Westudy their observable masses, depending at least on the three parameters,viz., the square speed of sound in the shell, instantaneous radial velocity ofthe shell at a moment when it reaches the horizon, and integration constantrelated to surface mass density. We discuss the features of black shellsdepending on an equation of state.

Target Space Duality II: Applications

  We apply the framework developed in Target Space Duality I: General Theory.We show that both nonabelian duality and Poisson-Lie duality are examples ofthe general theory. We propose how the formalism leads to a systematic study ofduality by studying few scenarios that lead to open questions in the theory ofLie algebras. We present evidence that there are probably new examples ofirreducible target space duality.

  We provide a short and non-technical summary of our current knowledge andsome possible perspectives on the group field theory formalism for quantumgravity, in the form of a (partial) FAQ (with answers). Some of the questionsand answers relate to aspects of the formalism that concern loop quantumgravity. This summary also aims at giving a brief, rough guide to the recentliterature on group field theory (and tensor models).

Frequently Asked Questions for: The Atoms of Neural Computation

  Based on a survey of the literature, we attempt to answer Frequently AskedQuestions on issues of cortical uniformity vs. non-uniformity, the neuralmechanisms of symbolic variable binding, and other issues highlighted in(Marcus, Marblestone and Dean. "The Atoms of Neural Computation". Science. 31October 2014. Vol 346. Issue 6209).

Preprint Déjà Vu: an FAQ

  I give a brief overview of arXiv history, and describe the current state ofarXiv practice, both technical and sociological. This commentary originallyappeared in the EMBO Journal, 19 Oct 2016. It was intended as an update oncomments from the late 1990s regarding use of preprints by biologists (or lackthereof), but may be of interest to practitioners of other disciplines. It isbased largely on a keynote presentation I gave to the ASAPbio inaugural meetingin Feb 2016, and responds as well to some follow-up questions.

CCPs, Central Clearing, CSA, Credit Collateral and Funding Costs  Valuation FAQ: Re-hypothecation, CVA, Closeout, Netting, WWR, Gap-Risk,  Initial and Variation Margins, Multiple Discount Curves, FVA?

  We present a dialogue on Funding Costs and Counterparty Credit Risk modeling,inclusive of collateral, wrong way risk, gap risk and possible Central Clearingimplementation through CCPs. This framework is important following the factthat derivatives valuation and risk analysis has moved from exotic derivativesmanaged on simple single asset classes to simple derivatives embedding the newor previously neglected types of complex and interconnected nonlinear risks weaddress here. This dialogue is the continuation of the "Counterparty Risk,Collateral and Funding FAQ" by Brigo (2011). In this dialogue we focus more onfunding costs for the hedging strategy of a portfolio of trades, on thenon-linearities emerging from assuming borrowing and lending rates to bedifferent, on the resulting aggregation-dependent valuation process and itsoperational challenges, on the implications of the onset of central clearing,on the macro and micro effects on valuation and risk of the onset of CCPs, oninitial and variation margins impact on valuation, and on multiple discountcurves. Through questions and answers (Q&A) between a senior expert and ajunior colleague, and by referring to the growing body of literature on thesubject, we present a unified view of valuation (and risk) that takes all suchaspects into account.

Caenorhabditis elegans and the network control framework - FAQs

  Control is essential to the functioning of any neural system. Indeed, underhealthy conditions the brain must be able to continuously maintain a tightfunctional control between the system's inputs and outputs. One may thereforehypothesise that the brain's wiring is predetermined by the need to maintaincontrol across multiple scales, maintaining the stability of key internalvariables, and producing behaviour in response to environmental cues. Recentadvances in network control have offered a powerful mathematical framework toexplore the structure-function relationship in complex biological, social, andtechnological networks, and are beginning to yield important and preciseinsights for neuronal systems. The network control paradigm promises apredictive, quantitative framework to unite the distinct datasets necessary tofully describe a nervous system, and provide mechanistic explanations for theobserved structure and function relationships. Here, we provide a thoroughreview of the network control framework as applied to C. elegans, in the styleof a FAQ. We present the theoretical, computational, and experimental aspectsof network control, and discuss its current capabilities and limitations,together with the next likely advances and improvements. We further present thePython code to enable exploration of control principles in a manner specific tothis prototypical organism.

Proof of Riemann's zeta-hypothesis

  Make an exponential transformation in the integral formulation of Riemann'szeta-function zeta(s) for Re(s) > 0. Separately, in addition make thesubstitution s -> 1 - s and then transform back to s again using the functionalequation. Using residue calculus, we can in this way get two alternative,equivalent series expansions for zeta(s) of order N, both valid inside the"critical strip", i e for 0 < Re(s) < 1. Together, these two expansions embodyimportant characteristics of the zeta-function in this range, and theirdetailed behavior as N tends to infinity can be used to prove Riemann'szeta-hypothesis that the nontrivial zeros of the zeta-function must all havereal part 1/2.  In addition to the preprint, the arXiv file also contains a discussion ofsome forty Frequently Asked Questions from readers. Further questions notadequately dealt with in the existing FAQ are welcome.

Brout-Englert-Higgs physics: From foundations to phenomenology

  The aim of this review is to describe the field-theoretical foundations ofBrout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) physics, and to show how the usual phenomenologyarises from it. This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning tothe underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like theHiggs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and theBEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed bycarefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phasediagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms ofgauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states. Using gauge-invariant perturbationtheory, as developed by Froehlich, Morchio, and Strocchi, it is possible torederive conventional perturbation theory. This derivation explicitly shows whythe description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,gauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, butalso of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful. These areunavoidable consequences of the field theory underlying the standard model,from which the usual picture emerges. The validity of this emergence can onlybe tested non-perturbatively. Such tests, in particular using lattice gaugetheory, will be reviewed as well. They fully confirm the underlying mechanisms.It will be seen that the structure of the standard model is very special, andqualitative changes occur beyond it. The extension beyond the standard modelwill therefore also be reviewed. Particular attention will be given tostructural differences arising for phenomenology. Again, non-perturbative testsof these results will be reviewed. Finally, to make this review self-containeda brief discussion of issues like the triviality and hierarchy problem, and howthey fit into a fundamental field-theoretical formulation, is included.

Target Space Duality I: General Theory

  We develop a systematic framework for studying target space duality at theclassical level. We show that target space duality between manifolds M andMtilde arises because of the existence of a very special symplectic manifold.This manifold locally looks like M x Mtilde and admits a double fibration. Weanalyze the local geometric requirements necessary for target space duality andprove that both manifolds must admit flat orthogonal connections. We show howabelian duality, nonabelian duality and Poisson-Lie duality are all specialcases of a more general framework. As an example we exhibit new (nonlinear)dualities in the case M = Mtilde = R^n.

No extension of quantum theory can have improved predictive power

  According to quantum theory, measurements generate random outcomes, in starkcontrast with classical mechanics. This raises the question of whether therecould exist an extension of the theory which removes this indeterminism, assuspected by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR). Although this has been shownto be impossible, existing results do not imply that the current theory ismaximally informative. Here we ask the more general question of whether anyimproved predictions can be achieved by any extension of quantum theory. Underthe assumption that measurements can be chosen freely, we answer this questionin the negative: no extension of quantum theory can give more information aboutthe outcomes of future measurements than quantum theory itself. Our result hassignificance for the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as applicationsto tasks that exploit the inherent randomness in quantum theory, such asquantum cryptography.

Seeded Graph Matching

  Given two graphs, the graph matching problem is to align the two vertex setsso as to minimize the number of adjacency disagreements between the two graphs.The seeded graph matching problem is the graph matching problem when we arefirst given a partial alignment that we are tasked with completing. In thispaper, we modify the state-of-the-art approximate graph matching algorithm"FAQ" of Vogelstein et al. (2015) to make it a fast approximate seeded graphmatching algorithm, adapt its applicability to include graphs with differentlysized vertex sets, and extend the algorithm so as to provide, for eachindividual vertex, a nomination list of likely matches. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our algorithm via simulation and real data experiments;indeed, knowledge of even a few seeds can be extremely effective when ourseeded graph matching algorithm is used to recover a naturally existingalignment that is only partially observed.

Toward incremental FIB aggregation with quick selections (FAQS)

  Several approaches to mitigating the Forwarding Information Base (FIB)overflow problem were developed and software solutions using FIB aggregationare of particular interest. One of the greatest concerns to deploy thesealgorithms to real networks is their high running time and heavy computationaloverhead to handle thousands of FIB updates every second. In this work, wemanage to use a single tree traversal to implement faster aggregation andupdate handling algorithm with much lower memory footprint than other existingwork. We utilize 6-year realistic IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables from 2011 to2016 to evaluate the performance of our algorithm with various metrics. To thebest of our knowledge, it is the first time that IPv6 FIB aggregation has beenperformed. Our new solution is 2.53 and 1.75 times as fast asthe-state-of-the-art FIB aggregation algorithm for IPv4 and IPv6 FIBs,respectively, while achieving a near-optimal FIB aggregation ratio.

Excitons in soliton and bipolaron lattice states of doped Peierls  systems

  Exciton effects on soliton and bipolaron lattice states are investigatedusing an electron-lattice Peierls model with long-range Coulomb interactions.The Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation and the single-excitationconfiguration-interaction (single-CI) method are used to obtain opticalabsorption spectra. We discuss the following properties: (1) The attractionbetween the excited electron and the remaining hole makes the excitation energysmaller when the correlations are taken into account by the single-CI. Theoscillator strengths of the lower excited states become relatively larger thanin the HF calculations. (2) We look at variations of relative oscillatorstrengths of two or three kinds of excitons described by the single-CI. Whilethe excess-electron concentration is small, the ratio of the oscillatorstrengths of the exciton with the lowest energy, which is calculated againstthe total electronic excitation oscillator strengths, increases almostlinearly. The oscillator strengths accumulate at this exciton as theconcentration increases.

Lorentz-covariant quantum transport and the origin of dark energy

  A possible explanation for the enigma of dark energy, responsible for about76 % of the mass-energy of the universe, is obtained by requiring only that therigorous continuity equation (the Boltzmann transport equation) for quantapropagating through space should have the form of a Lorentz-covariant anddispersion-free wave equation. This requirement implies (i) properties ofspace-time which an observer would describe as uniform expansion in agreementwith Hubble's law, and (ii) that the quantum transport behaves like in amultiplicative medium with multiplication factor = 2. This inherent,essentially explosive multiplicity of vacuum, thus caused by the requirement ofLorentz-covariance, is suggested as a potential origin of dark energy. Inaddition, it is shown (iii) that this requirement of Lorentz-covariant quantumtransport leads to an apparent accelerated expansion of the universe.  In addition to the updated manuscript for Phys. Scr., the arXiv file alsocontains a discussion of about a dozen Frequently Asked Questions from readers.Further questions not adequately dealt with in the existing FAQ are welcome.

A Cancer Biotherapy Resource

  Cancer Biotherapy (CB), as opposed to cancer chemotherapy, is the use ofmacromolecular, biological agents instead of organic chemicals or drugs totreat cancer. Biological agents usually have higher selectivity and have lesstoxic side effects than chemical agents. The I.S.B.T.C., being the only majorinformation database for CB, seems lacking in some crucial information onvarious cancer biotherapy regimens. It is thus necessary to have acomprehensive curated CB database. The database accessible to cancer patientsand also should be a sounding board for scientific ideas by cancer researchers.The database/web server has information about main families of cancerbiotherapy regimens to date, namely, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Ras PathwayInhibitors, Cell-Cycle Active Agents, MAbs (monoclonal antibodies), ADEPT(Antibody-Directed Enzyme Pro-Drug Therapy), Cytokines, Anti-AngiogenesisAgents, Cancer Vaccines, Cell-based Immunotherapeutics, Gene Therapy,Hematopoietic Growth Factors, Retinoids, and CAAT. For each biotherapy regimen,we will extract the following attributes in populating the database: Cancertype, Gene/s and gene product/s involved, Gene sequence, Organs affected,Reference papers, Clinical phase/stage, Survival rate, Clinical test centerlocations, Cost, Patient blogs, Researcher blogs, and Future work. The databasewill be accessible to public through a website and had FAQs for making itunderstandable to the laymen and discussion page for researchers to expresstheir views and ideas. In addition to information about the biotherapyregimens, the website will link to other biologically significant databaseslike structural proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and lipidomics databases,as well as to news around the world regarding cancer therapy results. Thedatabase attributes would be regularly updated for novel attributes asdiscoveries are made.

Quantum Multiverses

  A quantum theory of the universe consists of a theory of its quantum dynamicsand a theory of its quantum state The theory predicts quantum multiverses inthe form of decoherent sets of alternative histories describing the evolutionof the universe's spacetime geometry and matter content. These consequencesfollow: (a) The universe generally exhibits different quantum multiverses atdifferent levels and kinds of coarse graining. (b) Quantum multiverses are nota choice or an assumption but are consequences of the theory or not. (c)Quantum multiverses are generic for simple theories (d) Anthropic selection isautomatic because observers are physical systems within the universe notsomehow outside it. (e) Quantum multiverses can provide different mechanismsfor the variation constants in effective theories (like the cosmologicalconstant) enabling anthropic selection. (f) Different levels of coarse grainedmultiverses provide different routes to calculation as a consequence ofdecoherence. We support these conclusions by analyzing the quantum multiversesof a variety of quantum cosmological models aimed at the prediction ofobservable properties of our universe. In particular we show how the example ofa multiverse consisting of a vast classical spacetime containing many pocketuniverses arises automatically as part of a quantum multiverse describing aneternally inflating false vacuum that decays by the quantum nucleation of truevacuum bubbles. In a FAQ we argue that the quantum multiverses of the universeare scientific, real, testable, falsifiable, and similar to those in otherareas of science even if they are not directly observable on arbitrarily largescales.
