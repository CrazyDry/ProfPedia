Patterns of Scalable Bayesian Inference

  Datasets are growing not just in size but in complexity, creating a demand
for rich models and quantification of uncertainty. Bayesian methods are an
excellent fit for this demand, but scaling Bayesian inference is a challenge.
In response to this challenge, there has been considerable recent work based on
varying assumptions about model structure, underlying computational resources,
and the importance of asymptotic correctness. As a result, there is a zoo of
ideas with few clear overarching principles.
  In this paper, we seek to identify unifying principles, patterns, and
intuitions for scaling Bayesian inference. We review existing work on utilizing
modern computing resources with both MCMC and variational approximation
techniques. From this taxonomy of ideas, we characterize the general principles
that have proven successful for designing scalable inference procedures and
comment on the path forward.


Deciding the Closure of Inconsistent Rooted Triples is NP-Complete

  Interpreting three-leaf binary trees or {\em rooted triples} as constraints
yields an entailment relation, whereby binary trees satisfying some rooted
triples must also thus satisfy others, and thence a closure operator, which is
known to be polynomial-time computable. This is extended to inconsistent triple
sets by defining that a triple is entailed by such a set if it is entailed by
any consistent subset of it.
  Determining whether the closure of an inconsistent rooted triple set can be
computed in polynomial time was posed as an open problem in the Isaac Newton
Institute's "Phylogenetics" program in 2007. It appears (as NC4) in a
collection of such open problems maintained by Mike Steel, and it is the last
of that collection's five problems concerning computational complexity to have
remained open. We resolve the complexity of computing this closure, proving
that its decision version is NP-Complete.
  In the process, we also prove that detecting the existence of {\em any}
acyclic B-hyperpath (from specified source to destination) is NP-Complete, in a
significantly narrower special case than the version whose {\em minimization}
problem was recently proven NP-hard by Ritz et al. This implies it is NP-hard
to approximate (our special case of) their minimization problem to within {\em
any} factor.


Red-Blue-Partitioned MST, TSP, and Matching

  Arkin et al.~\cite{ArkinBCCJKMM17} recently introduced \textit{partitioned
pairs} network optimization problems: given a metric-weighted graph on $n$
pairs of nodes, the task is to color one node from each pair red and the other
blue, and then to compute two separate \textit{network structures} or disjoint
(node-covering) subgraphs of a specified sort, one on the graph induced by the
red nodes and the other on the blue nodes. Three structures have been
investigated by \cite{ArkinBCCJKMM17}---\textit{spanning trees},
\textit{traveling salesperson tours}, and \textit{perfect matchings}---and the
three objectives to optimize for when computing such pairs of structures:
\textit{min-sum}, \textit{min-max}, and \textit{bottleneck}. We provide
improved approximation guarantees and/or strengthened hardness results for
these nine NP-hard problem settings.


Finding a Small Number of Colourful Components

  A partition $(V_1,\ldots,V_k)$ of the vertex set of a graph $G$ with a (not
necessarily proper) colouring $c$ is colourful if no two vertices in any $V_i$
have the same colour and every set $V_i$ induces a connected graph. The
COLOURFUL PARTITION problem is to decide whether a coloured graph $(G,c)$ has a
colourful partition of size at most $k$. This problem is closely related to the
COLOURFUL COMPONENTS problem, which is to decide whether a graph can be
modified into a graph whose connected components form a colourful partition by
deleting at most $p$ edges. Nevertheless we show that COLOURFUL PARTITION and
COLOURFUL COMPONENTS may have different complexities for restricted instances.
We tighten known NP-hardness results for both problems and in addition we prove
new hardness and tractability results for COLOURFUL PARTITION. Using these
results we complete our paper with a thorough parameterized study of COLOURFUL
PARTITION.


Composing graphical models with neural networks for structured
  representations and fast inference

  We propose a general modeling and inference framework that composes
probabilistic graphical models with deep learning methods and combines their
respective strengths. Our model family augments graphical structure in latent
variables with neural network observation models. For inference, we extend
variational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributions
with recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components of
these models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving a
scalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, natural
gradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick.
We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application to
mouse behavioral phenotyping.


Multimodal Prediction and Personalization of Photo Edits with Deep
  Generative Models

  Professional-grade software applications are powerful but
complicated$-$expert users can achieve impressive results, but novices often
struggle to complete even basic tasks. Photo editing is a prime example: after
loading a photo, the user is confronted with an array of cryptic sliders like
"clarity", "temp", and "highlights". An automatically generated suggestion
could help, but there is no single "correct" edit for a given image$-$different
experts may make very different aesthetic decisions when faced with the same
image, and a single expert may make different choices depending on the intended
use of the image (or on a whim). We therefore want a system that can propose
multiple diverse, high-quality edits while also learning from and adapting to a
user's aesthetic preferences. In this work, we develop a statistical model that
meets these objectives. Our model builds on recent advances in neural network
generative modeling and scalable inference, and uses hierarchical structure to
learn editing patterns across many diverse users. Empirically, we find that our
model outperforms other approaches on this challenging multimodal prediction
task.


MIMIC-CXR: A large publicly available database of labeled chest
  radiographs

  Chest radiography is an extremely powerful imaging modality, allowing for a
detailed inspection of a patient's thorax, but requiring specialized training
for proper interpretation. With the advent of high performance general purpose
computer vision algorithms, the accurate automated analysis of chest
radiographs is becoming increasingly of interest to researchers. However, a key
challenge in the development of these techniques is the lack of sufficient
data. Here we describe MIMIC-CXR, a large dataset of 371,920 chest x-rays
associated with 227,943 imaging studies sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center between 2011 - 2016. Each imaging study can pertain to one or
more images, but most often are associated with two images: a frontal view and
a lateral view. Images are provided with 14 labels derived from a natural
language processing tool applied to the corresponding free-text radiology
reports. All images have been de-identified to protect patient privacy. The
dataset is made freely available to facilitate and encourage a wide range of
research in medical computer vision.


Dependent Multinomial Models Made Easy: Stick Breaking with the
  PÃ³lya-Gamma Augmentation

  Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best
represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions. For
example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children's names in a given state and
year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial
distributions. In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency between
the draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the
preceding nucleotides, children's names are highly correlated from year to
year, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic. These dependencies are
not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here,
we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in
P\'olya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in terms
of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take
advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with
minimal overhead.


Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Galaxies at z~0.1: the Effect of
  Star Formation and AGN

  We present the analysis of the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) spectra
of a sample of 92 typical star forming galaxies at 0.03 < z < 0.2 observed with
the Spitzer IRS. We compare the relative strengths of PAH emission features
with SDSS optical diagnostics to probe the relationship between PAH grain
properties and star formation and AGN activity. Short-to-long wavelength PAH
ratios, and in particular the 7.7-to-11.3 micron feature ratio, are strongly
correlated with the star formation diagnostics D_n(4000) and H-alpha equivalent
width, increasing with younger stellar populations. This ratio also shows a
significant difference between active and non-active galaxies, with the active
galaxies exhibiting weaker 7.7 micron emission. A hard radiation field as
measured by [OIII]/H-beta and [NeIII]_15.6/[NeII]_12.8 affects PAH ratios
differently depending on whether this field results from starburst activity or
an AGN. Our results are consistent with a picture in which larger PAH molecules
grow more efficiently in richer media and in which smaller PAH molecules are
preferentially destroyed by AGN.


Winning versus losing during gambling and its neural correlates

  Humans often make decisions which maximize an internal utility function. For
example, humans often maximize their expected reward when gambling and this is
considered as a "rational" decision. However, humans tend to change their
betting strategies depending on how they "feel". If someone has experienced a
losing streak, they may "feel" that they are more likely to win on the next
hand even though the odds of the game have not changed. That is, their
decisions are driven by their emotional state. In this paper, we investigate
how the human brain responds to wins and losses during gambling. Using a
combination of local field potential recordings in human subjects performing a
financial decision-making task, spectral analyses, and non-parametric cluster
statistics, we investigated whether neural responses in different cognitive and
limbic brain areas differ between wins and losses after decisions are made. In
eleven subjects, the neural activity modulated significantly between win and
loss trials in one brain region: the anterior insula ($p=0.01$). In particular,
gamma activity (30-70 Hz) increased in the anterior insula when subjects just
realized that they won. Modulation of metabolic activity in the anterior insula
has been observed previously in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
during decision making and when emotions are elicited. However, our study is
able to characterize temporal dynamics of electrical activity in this brain
region at the millisecond resolution while decisions are made and after
outcomes are revealed.


Comet 322P/SOHO 1: An asteroid with the smallest perihelion distance?

  We observed comet 322P/SOHO 1 (P/1999 R1) from the ground and with the
Spitzer Space Telescope when it was between 2.2 and 1.2 AU from the Sun. These
are the first observations of any SOHO-discovered periodic comet by a non-solar
observatory, and allow us to investigate its behavior under typical cometary
circumstances. 322P appeared inactive in all images. Its lightcurve suggests a
rotation period of 2.8+/-0.3 hr and has an amplitude greater than ~0.3 mag,
implying a density of at least 1000 kg m$^{-3}$, considerably higher than that
of any known comet. It has average colors of g'-r' = 0.52+/-0.04 and r'-i' =
0.04+/-0.09. We converted these to Johnson colors and found that the V-R color
is consistent with average cometary colors, but R-I is somewhat bluer; these
colors are most similar to V- and Q-type asteroids. Modeling of the optical and
IR photometry suggests it has a diameter of 150-320 m and a geometric albedo of
0.09-0.42, with diameter and albedo inversely related. Our upper limits to any
undetected coma are still consistent with a sublimation lifetime shorter than
the typical dynamical lifetimes for Jupiter Family Comets. These results
suggest that it may be of asteroidal origin and only active in the SOHO fields
of view via processes different from the volatile-driven activity of
traditional comets. If so, it has the smallest perihelion distance of any known
asteroid.


Funding Games: the Truth but not the Whole Truth

  We introduce the Funding Game, in which $m$ identical resources are to be
allocated among $n$ selfish agents. Each agent requests a number of resources
$x_i$ and reports a valuation $\tilde{v}_i(x_i)$, which verifiably {\em
lower}-bounds $i$'s true value for receiving $x_i$ items. The pairs $(x_i,
\tilde{v}_i(x_i))$ can be thought of as size-value pairs defining a knapsack
problem with capacity $m$. A publicly-known algorithm is used to solve this
knapsack problem, deciding which requests to satisfy in order to maximize the
social welfare.
  We show that a simple mechanism based on the knapsack {\it highest ratio
greedy} algorithm provides a Bayesian Price of Anarchy of 2, and for the
complete information version of the game we give an algorithm that computes a
Nash equilibrium strategy profile in $O(n^2 \log^2 m)$ time. Our primary
algorithmic result shows that an extension of the mechanism to $k$ rounds has a
Price of Anarchy of $1 + \frac{1}{k}$, yielding a graceful tradeoff between
communication complexity and the social welfare.


Computing the obstacle number of a plane graph

  An obstacle representation of a plane graph G is V(G) together with a set of
opaque polygonal obstacles such that G is the visibility graph on V(G)
determined by the obstacles. We investigate the problem of computing an
obstacle representation of a plane graph (ORPG) with a minimum number of
obstacles. We call this minimum size the obstacle number of G.
  First, we show that ORPG is NP-hard by reduction from planar vertex cover,
resolving a question posed by [8]. Second, we give a reduction from ORPG to
maximum degree 3 planar vertex cover. Since this reduction preserves solution
values, it follows that ORPG is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) and admits a
polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS).


Evader Interdiction and Collateral Damage

  In network interdiction problems, evaders (e.g., hostile agents or data
packets) may be moving through a network towards targets and we wish to choose
locations for sensors in order to intercept the evaders before they reach their
destinations. The evaders might follow deterministic routes or Markov chains,
or they may be reactive}, i.e., able to change their routes in order to avoid
sensors placed to detect them. The challenge in such problems is to choose
sensor locations economically, balancing security gains with costs, including
the inconvenience sensors inflict upon innocent travelers. We study the
objectives of 1) maximizing the number of evaders captured when limited by a
budget on sensing cost and 2) capturing all evaders as cheaply as possible. We
give optimal sensor placement algorithms for several classes of special graphs
and hardness and approximation results for general graphs, including for
deterministic or Markov chain-based and reactive or oblivious evaders. In a
similar-sounding but fundamentally different problem setting posed by
Rubinstein and Glazer where both evaders and innocent travelers are reactive,
we again give optimal algorithms for special cases and hardness and
approximation results on general graphs.


Computing Traversal Times on Dynamic Markovian Paths

  In source routing, a complete path is chosen for a packet to travel from
source to destination. While computing the time to traverse such a path may be
straightforward in a fixed, static graph, doing so becomes much more
challenging in dynamic graphs, in which the state of an edge in one time slot
(i.e., its presence or absence) is random, and may depend on its state in the
previous time step. The traversal time is due to both time spent waiting for
edges to appear and time spent crossing them once they become available. We
compute the expected traversal time (ETT) for a dynamic path in a number of
special cases of stochastic edge dynamics models, and for three edge failure
models, culminating in a surprisingly challenging yet realistic setting in
which the initial configuration of edge states for the entire path is known. We
show that the ETT for this "initial configuration" setting can be computed in
quadratic time, by an algorithm based on probability generating functions. We
also give several linear-time upper and lower bounds on the ETT.


Using Photometry to Probe the Circumstellar Environment of delta Scorpii

  We acquired Johnson BV photometry of the binary Be disk system delta~Scorpii
during its 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 observing seasons and used it to probe
the innermost regions of the disk. We found that several disk building events
have occurred during this time, resulting in an overall brightening in the
V-band and reddening of the system. In addition to these long-term trends, we
found cyclical variability in each observing season on timescales between 60
and 100 days. We were able to reproduce the changes in the magnitude and colour
of delta Sco using our theoretical models and found that variable mass-loss
rates in the range 2.5-7.0x10^{-9} M_{sun}/yr over ~35 days can reproduce the
observed increase in brightness.


High-throughput screening for modulators of cellular contractile force

  When cellular contractile forces are central to pathophysiology, these forces
comprise a logical target of therapy. Nevertheless, existing high-throughput
screens are limited to upstream signaling intermediates with poorly defined
relationship to such a physiological endpoint. Using cellular force as the
target, here we screened libraries to identify novel drug candidates in the
case of human airway smooth muscle cells in the context of asthma, and also in
the case of Schlemm's canal endothelial cells in the context of glaucoma. This
approach identified several drug candidates for both asthma and glaucoma. We
attained rates of 1000 compounds per screening day, thus establishing a
force-based cellular platform for high-throughput drug discovery.


Recurrent switching linear dynamical systems

  Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams
traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear
dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into
segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on
switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that
not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching
behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These "recurrent"
switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the
conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS
models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate
inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable.


Correlations Between the WMAP and MAXIMA Cosmic Microwave Background
  Anisotropy Maps

  We cross-correlate the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy
maps from the WMAP, MAXIMA-I, and MAXIMA-II experiments. We use the
cross-spectrum, which is the spherical harmonic transform of the angular
two-point correlation function, to quantify the correlation as a function of
angular scale. We find that the three possible pairs of cross-spectra are in
close agreement with each other and with the power spectra of the individual
maps. The probability that there is no correlation between the maps is smaller
than 1 * 10^(-8). We also calculate power spectra for maps made of differences
between pairs of maps, and show that they are consistent with no signal. The
results conclusively show that the three experiments not only display the same
statistical properties of the CMB anisotropy, but also detect the same features
wherever the observed sky areas overlap. We conclude that the contribution of
systematic errors to these maps is negligible and that MAXIMA and WMAP have
accurately mapped the cosmic microwave background anisotropy.


Five New Millisecond Pulsars From a Radio Survey of 14 Unidentified
  Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Sources

  We have discovered five millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in a survey of 14
unidentified Fermi-LAT sources in the southern sky using the Parkes radio
telescope. PSRs J0101-6422, J1514-4946, and J1902-5105 reside in binaries,
while PSRs J1658-5324 and J1747-4036 are isolated. Using an ephemeris derived
from timing observations of PSR J0101-6422 (P =2.57 ms, DM=12 pc cm-3), we have
detected {\gamma}-ray pulsations and measured its proper motion. Its
{\gamma}-ray spectrum (a power law of {\Gamma} = 0.9 with a cutoff at 1.6 GeV)
and efficiency are typical of other MSPs, but its radio and {\gamma}-ray light
curves challenge simple geometric models of emission. The high success rate of
this survey-enabled by selecting {\gamma}-ray sources based on their detailed
spectral characteristics-and other similarly successful searches indicate that
a substantial fraction of the local population of MSPs may soon be known.


The Physical Conditions, Metallicity and Metal Abundance Ratios In a
  Highly Magnified Galaxy at z = 3.6252

  We present optical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy of SGAS
J105039.6$+$001730, a strongly lensed galaxy at z $=$ 3.6252 magnified by
$>$30$\times$, and derive its physical properties. We measure a stellar mass of
log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) $=$ 9.5 $\pm$ 0.35, star formation rates from [O
II]$\lambda$$\lambda$3727 and H-$\beta$ of 55 $\pm$ 20 and 84 $\pm$ 17
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, an electron density of n$_{e} \leq$
10$^{3}$ cm$^{-2}$, an electron temperature of T$_{e} \leq$ 14000 K, and a
metallicity of 12+log(O/H) $=$ 8.3 $\pm$ 0.1. The strong C
III]$\lambda$$\lambda$1907,1909 emission and abundance ratios of C, N, O and Si
are consistent with well-studied starbursts at z $\sim$ 0 with similar
metallicities. Strong P Cygni lines and He II$\lambda$1640 emission indicate a
significant population of Wolf-Rayet stars, but synthetic spectra of individual
populations of young, hot stars do not reproduce the observed integrated P
Cygni absorption features. The rest-frame UV spectral features are indicative
of a young starburst with high ionization, implying either 1) an ionization
parameter significantly higher than suggest by rest-frame optical nebular
lines, or 2) differences in one or both of the initial mass function and the
properties of ionizing spectra of massive stars. We argue that the observed
features are likely the result of a superposition of star forming regions with
different physical properties. These results demonstrate the complexity of star
formation on scales smaller than individual galaxies, and highlight the
importance of systematic effects that result from smearing together the
signatures of individual star forming regions within galaxies.


Retired A Stars and Their Companions VI. A Pair of Interacting Exoplanet
  Pairs Around the Subgiants 24 Sextanis and HD200964

  We report radial velocity measurements of the G-type subgiants 24 Sextanis
(=HD90043) and HD200964. Both are massive, evolved stars that exhibit periodic
variations due to the presence of a pair of Jovian planets. Photometric
monitoring with the T12 0.80m APT at Fairborn Observatory demonstrates both
stars to be constant in brightness to <= 0.002 mag, thus strengthening the
planetary interpretation of the radial velocity variations. 24 Sex b,c have
orbital periods of 453.8 days and 883~days, corresponding to semimajor axes
1.333 AU and 2.08 AU, and minimum masses (Msini) 1.99 Mjup and 0.86 Mjup,
assuming a stellar mass 1.54 Msun. HD200964 b,c have orbital periods of 613.8
days and 825 days, corresponding to semimajor axes 1.601 AU and 1.95 AU, and
minimum masses 1.85 Mjup and 0.90 Mjup, assuming M* = 1.44 Msun. We also carry
out dynamical simulations to properly account for gravitational interactions
between the planets. Most, if not all, of the dynamically stable solutions
include crossing orbits, suggesting that each system is locked in a mean motion
resonance that prevents close encounters and provides long-term stability. The
planets in the 24 Sex system likely have a period ratio near 2:1, while the
HD200964 system is even more tightly packed with a period ratio close to 4:3.
However, we caution that further radial velocity observations and more detailed
dynamical modelling will be required to provide definitive and unique orbital
solutions for both cases, and to determine whether the two systems are truly
resonant.


The NASA-UC Eta-Earth Program: I. A Super-Earth Orbiting HD 7924

  We report the discovery of the first low-mass planet to emerge from the
NASA-UC Eta-Earth Program, a super-Earth orbiting the K0 dwarf HD 7924.
Keplerian modeling of precise Doppler radial velocities reveals a planet with
minimum mass M_P sin i = 9.26 M_Earth in a P = 5.398 d orbit. Based on
Keck-HIRES measurements from 2001 to 2008, the planet is robustly detected with
an estimated false alarm probability of less than 0.001. Photometric
observations using the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn Observatory
show that HD 7924 is photometrically constant over the radial velocity period
to 0.19 mmag, supporting the existence of the planetary companion. No transits
were detected down to a photometric limit of ~0.5 mmag, eliminating transiting
planets with a variety of compositions. HD 7924b is one of only eight planets
known with M_P sin i < 10 M_Earth and as such is a member of an emerging family
of low-mass planets that together constrain theories of planet formation.


Modeling and Analysis of Time-Varying Graphs

  We live in a world increasingly dominated by networks -- communications,
social, information, biological etc. A central attribute of many of these
networks is that they are dynamic, that is, they exhibit structural changes
over time. While the practice of dynamic networks has proliferated, we lag
behind in the fundamental, mathematical understanding of network dynamism.
Existing research on time-varying graphs ranges from preliminary algorithmic
studies (e.g., Ferreira's work on evolving graphs) to analysis of specific
properties such as flooding time in dynamic random graphs. A popular model for
studying dynamic graphs is a sequence of graphs arranged by increasing
snapshots of time. In this paper, we study the fundamental property of
reachability in a time-varying graph over time and characterize the latency
with respect to two metrics, namely store-or-advance latency and cut-through
latency. Instead of expected value analysis, we concentrate on characterizing
the exact probability distribution of routing latency along a randomly
intermittent path in two popular dynamic random graph models. Using this
analysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting)
between multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all the
temporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graph
properties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operation
called smashing), with multiple intermediate variants. We also show how some
other traditional graph theoretic properties can be extended to the temporal
domain. Finally, we propose algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet
in single-copy adaptive routing schemes in various dynamic random graphs.


Testing Inflation with Large Scale Structure: Connecting Hopes with
  Reality

  The statistics of primordial curvature fluctuations are our window into the
period of inflation, where these fluctuations were generated. To date, the
cosmic microwave background has been the dominant source of information about
these perturbations. Large scale structure is however from where drastic
improvements should originate. In this paper, we explain the theoretical
motivations for pursuing such measurements and the challenges that lie ahead.
In particular, we discuss and identify theoretical targets regarding the
measurement of primordial non-Gaussianity. We argue that when quantified in
terms of the local (equilateral) template amplitude $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$
($f_{\rm NL}^{\rm eq}$), natural target levels of sensitivity are $\Delta
f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc, eq.} \simeq 1$. We highlight that such levels are within
reach of future surveys by measuring 2-, 3- and 4-point statistics of the
galaxy spatial distribution. This paper summarizes a workshop held at CITA
(University of Toronto) on October 23-24, 2014.


Selfish Knapsack

  We consider a selfish variant of the knapsack problem. In our version, the
items are owned by agents, and each agent can misrepresent the set of items she
owns---either by avoiding reporting some of them (understating), or by
reporting additional ones that do not exist (overstating). Each agent's
objective is to maximize, within the items chosen for inclusion in the
knapsack, the total valuation of her own chosen items. The knapsack problem, in
this context, seeks to minimize the worst-case approximation ratio for social
welfare at equilibrium. We show that a randomized greedy mechanism has
attractive strategic properties: in general, it has a correlated price of
anarchy of $2$ (subject to a mild assumption). For overstating-only agents, it
becomes strategyproof; we also provide a matching lower bound of $2$ on the
(worst-case) approximation ratio attainable by randomized strategyproof
mechanisms, and show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism can provide
any constant approximation ratio. We also deal with more specialized
environments. For the case of $2$ understating-only agents, we provide a
randomized strategyproof $\frac{5+4\sqrt{2}}{7} \approx 1.522$-approximate
mechanism, and a lower bound of $\frac{5\sqrt{5}-9}{2} \approx 1.09$. When all
agents but one are honest, we provide a deterministic strategyproof
$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$-approximate mechanism with a matching
lower bound. Finally, we consider a model where agents can misreport their
items' properties rather than existence. Specifically, each agent owns a single
item, whose value-to-size ratio is publicly known, but whose actual value and
size are not. We show that an adaptation of the greedy mechanism is
strategyproof and $2$-approximate, and provide a matching lower bound; we also
show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism can provide a constant
approximation ratio.


Estimating the Spectral Density of Large Implicit Matrices

  Many important problems are characterized by the eigenvalues of a large
matrix. For example, the difficulty of many optimization problems, such as
those arising from the fitting of large models in statistics and machine
learning, can be investigated via the spectrum of the Hessian of the empirical
loss function. Network data can be understood via the eigenstructure of a graph
Laplacian matrix using spectral graph theory. Quantum simulations and other
many-body problems are often characterized via the eigenvalues of the solution
space, as are various dynamic systems. However, naive eigenvalue estimation is
computationally expensive even when the matrix can be represented; in many of
these situations the matrix is so large as to only be available implicitly via
products with vectors. Even worse, one may only have noisy estimates of such
matrix vector products. In this work, we combine several different techniques
for randomized estimation and show that it is possible to construct unbiased
estimators to answer a broad class of questions about the spectra of such
implicit matrices, even in the presence of noise. We validate these methods on
large-scale problems in which graph theory and random matrix theory provide
ground truth.


Experimental demonstration of Pauli-frame randomization on a
  superconducting qubit

  The realization of quantum computing's promise despite noisy imperfect qubits
relies, at its core, on the ability to scale cheaply through error correction
and fault-tolerance. While fault-tolerance requires relatively mild assumptions
about the nature of the errors, the overhead associated with coherent and
non-Markovian errors can be orders of magnitude larger than the overhead
associated with purely stochastic Markovian errors. One proposal, known as
Pauli frame randomization, addresses this challenge by randomizing the circuits
so that the errors are rendered incoherent, while the computation remains
unaffected. Similarly, randomization can suppress couplings to slow degrees of
freedom associated with non-Markovian evolution. Here we demonstrate the
implementation of circuit randomization in a superconducting circuit system,
exploiting a flexible programming and control infrastructure to achieve this
with low effort. We use high-accuracy gate-set tomography to demonstrate that
without randomization the natural errors experienced by our experiment have
coherent character, and that with randomization these errors are rendered
incoherent. We also demonstrate that randomization suppresses signatures of
non-Markovianity evolution to statistically insignificant levels. This
demonstrates how noise models can be shaped into more benign forms for improved
performance.


SSGSS: The Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey

  The Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey (SSGSS) provides a new sample of
101 star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2 with unprecedented multi-wavelength
coverage. New mid- to far-infrared spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space
Telescope is added to a rich suite of previous imaging and spectroscopy,
including ROSAT, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Two
Micron All Sky Survey, and Spitzer/SWIRE. Sample selection ensures an even
coverage of the full range of normal galaxy properties, spanning two orders of
magnitude in stellar mass, color, and dust attenuation. In this paper we
present the SSGSS data set, describe the science drivers, and detail the sample
selection, observations, data reduction, and quality assessment. Also in this
paper, we compare the shape of the thermal continuum and the degree of silicate
absorption of these typical, star-forming galaxies to those of starburst
galaxies. We investigate the link between star formation rate, infrared
luminosity, and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosity, with a view
to calibrating the latter for spectral energy distribution models in
photometric samples and at high redshift. Last, we take advantage of the 5-40
micron spectroscopic and far-infrared photometric coverage of this sample to
perform detailed fitting of the Draine et al. dust models, and investigate the
link between dust mass and star formation history and active galactic nucleus
properties.


Chemical Cartography with APOGEE: Multi-element abundance ratios

  We map the trends of elemental abundance ratios across the Galactic disk,
spanning R = 3-15 kpc and midplane distance |Z|= 0-2 kpc, for 15 elements in a
sample of 20,485 stars measured by the SDSS/APOGEE survey (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si,
P, S, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Adopting Mg rather than Fe as our
reference element, and separating stars into two populations based on [Fe/Mg],
we find that the median trends of [X/Mg] vs. [Mg/H] in each population are
nearly independent of location in the Galaxy. The full multi-element
cartography can be summarized by combining these nearly universal median
sequences with our measured metallicity distribution functions and the relative
proportions of the low-[Fe/Mg] (high-alpha) and high-[Fe/Mg] (low-alpha)
populations, which depend strongly on R and |Z|. We interpret the median
sequences with a semi-empirical "2-process" model that describes both the ratio
of core collapse and Type Ia supernova contributions to each element and the
metallicity dependence of the supernova yields. These observationally inferred
trends can provide strong tests of supernova nucleosynthesis calculations. Our
results lead to a relatively simple picture of abundance ratio variations in
the Milky Way, in which the trends at any location can be described as the sum
of two components with relative contributions that change systematically and
smoothly across the Galaxy. Deviations from this picture and future extensions
to other elements can provide further insights into the physics of stellar
nucleosynthesis and unusual events in the Galaxy's history.


The Open Cluster Chemical Analysis and Mapping Survey: Local Galactic
  Metallicity Gradient with APOGEE using SDSS DR10

  The Open Cluster Chemical Analysis and Mapping (OCCAM) Survey aims to produce
a comprehensive, uniform, infrared-based dataset for hundreds of open clusters,
and constrain key Galactic dynamical and chemical parameters from this sample.
This first contribution from the OCCAM survey presents analysis of 141 members
stars in 28 open clusters with high-resolution metallicities derived from a
large uniform sample collected as part of the SDSS-III/Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). This sample includes the first
high-resolution metallicity measurements for 22 open clusters. With this
largest ever uniformly observed sample of open cluster stars we investigate the
Galactic disk gradients of both [M/H] and [alpha/M]. We find basically no
gradient across this range in [alpha/M], but [M/H] does show a gradient for
R_{GC} < 10 kpc and a significant flattening beyond R_{GC} = 10 kpc. In
particular, whereas fitting a single linear trend yields an [M/H] gradient of
-0.09 +/- 0.03$ dex/kpc --- similar to previously measure gradients inside 13
kpc --- by independently fitting inside and outside 10 kpc separately we find a
significantly steeper gradient near the Sun (7.9 <= R_{GC} <= 10) than
previously found (-0.20 +/- 0.08 dex/kpc) and a nearly flat trend beyond 10 kpc
(-0.02 +/- 0.09 dex/kpc).


The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment: First
  Detection of High Velocity Milky Way Bar Stars

  Commissioning observations with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III, have
produced radial velocities (RVs) for ~4700 K/M-giant stars in the Milky Way
bulge. These high-resolution (R \sim 22,500), high-S/N (>100 per resolution
element), near-infrared (1.51-1.70 um; NIR) spectra provide accurate RVs
(epsilon_v~0.2 km/s) for the sample of stars in 18 Galactic bulge fields
spanning -1<l<20 deg, |b|<20 deg, and dec>-32 deg. This represents the largest
NIR high-resolution spectroscopic sample of giant stars ever assembled in this
region of the Galaxy. A cold (sigma_v~30 km/s), high-velocity peak (V_GSR \sim
+200 km/s) is found to comprise a significant fraction (~10%) of stars in many
of these fields. These high RVs have not been detected in previous MW surveys
and are not expected for a simple, circularly rotating disk. Preliminary
distance estimates rule out an origin from the background Sagittarius tidal
stream or a new stream in the MW disk. Comparison to various Galactic models
suggests that these high RVs are best explained by stars in orbits of the
Galactic bar potential, although some observational features remain
unexplained.


Young alpha-enriched giant stars in the solar neighbourhood

  We derive age constraints for 1639 red giants in the APOKASC sample for which
seismic parameters from Kepler, as well as effective temperatures,
metallicities and [alpha/Fe] values from APOGEE DR12 are available. We
investigate the relation between age and chemical abundances for these stars,
using a simple and robust approach to obtain ages. We first derive stellar
masses using standard seismic scaling relations, then determine the maximum
possible age for each star as function of its mass and metallicity,
independently of its evolutionary stage. While the overall trend between
maximum age and chemical abundances is a declining fraction of young stars with
increasing [alpha/Fe], at least 14 out of 241 stars with [alpha/Fe]>0.13 are
younger than 6 Gyr. Five stars with [alpha/Fe]>0.2 have ages below 4 Gyr. We
examine the effect of modifications in the standard seismic scaling relations,
as well as the effect of very low helium fractions, but these changes are not
enough to make these stars as old as usually expected for alpha-rich stars
(i.e., ages greater than 8-9 Gyr). Such unusual alpha-rich young stars have
also been detected by other surveys, but defy simple explanations in a galaxy
evolution context.


Sodium and Oxygen Abundances in the Open Cluster NGC 6791 from APOGEE
  H-Band Spectroscopy

  The open cluster NGC 6791 is among the oldest, most massive and metal-rich
open clusters in the Galaxy. High-resolution $H$-band spectra from the Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) of 11 red giants in
NGC 6791 are analyzed for their chemical abundances of iron, oxygen, and
sodium. The abundances of these three elements are found to be homogeneous
(with abundance dispersions at the level of $\sim$ 0.05 - 0.07 dex) in these
cluster red giants, which span much of the red-giant branch (T$_{\rm eff}$
$\sim$ 3500K - 4600K), and include two red-clump giants. From the infrared
spectra, this cluster is confirmed to be among the most metal-rich clusters in
the Galaxy ($<$[Fe/H]$>$ = 0.34 $\pm$ 0.06), and is found to have a roughly
solar value of [O/Fe] and slightly enhanced [Na/Fe]. Non-LTE calculations for
the studied Na I lines in the APOGEE spectral region ($\lambda$16373.86\AA\ and
$\lambda$16388.85\AA) indicate only small departures from LTE ($\leq$ 0.04 dex)
for the parameter range and metallicity of the studied stars. The previously
reported double population of cluster members with different Na abundances is
not found among the studied sample.


ASPCAP: The Apogee Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline

  The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has built
the largest moderately high-resolution (R=22, 500) spectroscopic map of the
stars across the Milky Way, and including dust-obscured areas. The APOGEE
Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software
developed for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines
atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra by
comparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using chi-2
minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of a
fortran90 code that does the actual minimization, and a wrapper IDL code for
book-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP
components and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests
designed to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effective
temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2%, 0.1 dex, and
0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants.
It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels
of precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000
stars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.


Enabling New ALMA Science with Improved Support for Time-Domain
  Observations

  While the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a uniquely
powerful telescope, its impact in certain fields of astrophysics has been
limited by observatory policies rather than the telescope's innate technical
capabilities. In particular, several observatory policies present challenges
for observations of variable, mobile, and/or transient sources --- collectively
referred to here as "time-domain" observations. In this whitepaper we identify
some of these policies, describe the scientific applications they impair, and
suggest changes that would increase ALMA's science impact in Cycle 6 and
beyond.
  Parties interested in time-domain science with ALMA are encouraged to join

mailing list at https://groups.google.com/group/alma-td-sig .


Rapid Rotation of Low-Mass Red Giants Using APOKASC: A Measure of
  Interaction Rates on the Post-main-sequence

  We investigate the occurrence rate of rapidly rotating ($v\sin i$$>$10 km
s$^{-1}$), low-mass giant stars in the APOGEE-Kepler (APOKASC) fields with
asteroseismic mass and surface gravity measurements. Such stars are likely
merger products and their frequency places interesting constraints on stellar
population models. We also identify anomalous rotators, i.e. stars with 5 km
s$^{-1}$$<$$v\sin i$$<$10 km s$^{-1}$ that are rotating significantly faster
than both angular momentum evolution predictions and the measured rates of
similar stars. Our data set contains fewer rapid rotators than one would expect
given measurements of the Galactic field star population, which likely
indicates that asteroseismic detections are less common in rapidly rotating red
giants. The number of low-mass moderate (5-10 km s$^{-1}$) rotators in our
sample gives a lower limit of 7% for the rate at which low-mass stars interact
on the upper red giant branch because single stars in this mass range are
expected to rotate slowly. Finally, we classify the likely origin of the rapid
or anomalous rotation where possible. KIC 10293335 is identified as a merger
product and KIC 6501237 is a possible binary system of two oscillating red
giants.


Chemical abundance gradients from open clusters in the Milky Way disk:
  results from the APOGEE survey

  Metallicity gradients provide strong constraints for understanding the
chemical evolution of the Galaxy. We report on radial abundance gradients of
Fe, Ni, Ca, Si, and Mg obtained from a sample of 304 red-giant members of 29
disk open clusters, mostly concentrated at galactocentric distances between ~8
- 15 kpc, but including two open clusters in the outer disk. The observations
are from the APOGEE survey. The chemical abundances were derived automatically
by the ASPCAP pipeline and these are part of the SDSS III Data Release 12. The
gradients, obtained from least squares fits to the data, are relatively flat,
with slopes ranging from -0.026 to -0.033 dex/kpc for the alpha-elements [O/H],
[Ca/H], [Si/H] and [Mg/H] and -0.035 dex/kpc and -0.040 dex/kpc for [Fe/H] and
[Ni/H], respectively. Our results are not at odds with the possibility that
metallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients are steeper in the inner disk (R_GC ~7 - 12 kpc)
and flatter towards the outer disk. The open cluster sample studied spans a
significant range in age. When breaking the sample into age bins, there is some
indication that the younger open cluster population in our sample (log age <
8.7) has a flatter metallicity gradient when compared with the gradients
obtained from older open clusters.


The roAp star $Î±$ Circini as seen by BRITE-Constellation

  We report on an analysis of high-precision, multi-colour photometric
observations of the rapidly-oscillating Ap (roAp) star $\alpha$ Cir. These
observations were obtained with the BRITE-Constellation, which is a coordinated
mission of five nanosatellites that collects continuous
millimagnitude-precision photometry of dozens of bright stars for up to 180
days at a time in two colours (Johnson B and R). BRITE stands for BRight Target
Explorer. The object $\alpha$ Cir is the brightest roAp star and an ideal
target for such investigations, facilitating the determination of oscillation
frequencies with high resolution. This star is bright enough for complementary
interferometry and time-resolved spectroscopy. Four BRITE satellites observed
$\alpha$ Cir for 146 d or 33 rotational cycles. Phasing the photometry
according to the 4.4790 d rotational period reveals qualitatively different
light variations in the two photometric bands. The phased red-band photometry
is in good agreement with previously-published WIRE data, showing a light curve
symmetric about phase 0.5 with a strong contribution from the first harmonic.
The phased blue-band data, in contrast, show an essentially sinusoidal
variation. We model both light curves with Bayesian Photometric Imaging, which
suggests the presence of two large-scale, photometrically bright (relative to
the surrounding photosphere) spots. We also examine the high-frequency
pulsation spectrum as encoded in the BRITE photometry. Our analysis establishes
the stability of the main pulsation frequency over the last 20 years, confirms
the presence of frequency f7, which was not detected (or the mode not excited)
prior to 2006, and excludes quadrupolar modes for the main pulsation frequency.


Excess Optical Enhancement Observed with ARCONS for Early Crab Giant
  Pulses

  We observe an extraordinary link in the Crab pulsar between the enhancement
of an optical pulse and the timing of the corresponding giant radio pulse. At
optical through infrared wavelengths, our observations use the high time
resolution of ARCONS, a unique superconducting energy-resolving photon-counting
array at the Palomar 200-inch telescope. At radio wavelengths, we observe with
the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope and the GUPPI backend. We see an
$11.3\pm2.5\%$ increase in peak optical flux for pulses that have an
accompanying giant radio pulse arriving near the peak of the optical main
pulse, in contrast to a $3.2\pm0.5\%$ increase when an accompanying giant radio
pulse arrives soon after the optical peak. We also observe that the peak of the
optical main pulse is $2.8\pm0.8\%$ enhanced when there is a giant radio pulse
accompanying the optical interpulse. We observe no statistically significant
spectral differences between optical pulses accompanied by and not accompanied
by giant radio pulses. Our results extend previous observations of
optical-radio correlation to the time and spectral domains. Our refined
temporal correlation suggests that optical and radio emission are indeed
causally linked, and the lack of spectral differences suggests that the same
mechanism is responsible for all optical emission.


Kepler Flares II: The Temporal Morphology of White-Light Flares on GJ
  1243

  We present the largest sample of flares ever compiled for a single M dwarf,
the active M4 star GJ 1243. Over 6100 individual flare events, with energies
ranging from $10^{29}$ to $10^{33}$ erg, are found in 11 months of 1-minute
cadence data from Kepler. This sample is unique for its completeness and
dynamic range. We have developed automated tools for finding flares in
short-cadence Kepler light curves, and performed extensive validation and
classification of the sample by eye. From this pristine sample of flares we
generate a median flare template. This template shows that two exponential
cooling phases are present during the white-light flare decay, providing
fundamental constraints for models of flare physics. The template is also used
as a basis function to decompose complex multi-peaked flares, allowing us to
study the energy distribution of these events. Only a small number of flare
events are not well fit by our template. We find that complex, multi-peaked
flares occur in over 80% of flares with a duration of 50 minutes or greater.
The underlying distribution of flare durations for events 10 minutes and longer
appears to follow a broken power law. Our results support the idea that
sympathetic flaring may be responsible for some complex flare events.


RELICS: Strong-lensing analysis of the massive clusters MACS
  J0308.9+2645 and PLCK G171.9-40.7

  Strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has become a powerful tool
for probing the high-redshift Universe, magnifying distant and faint background
galaxies. Reliable strong lensing (SL) models are crucial for determining the
intrinsic properties of distant, magnified sources and for constructing their
luminosity function. We present here the first SL analysis of MACS J0308.9+2645
and PLCK G171.9-40.7, two massive galaxy clusters imaged with the Hubble Space
Telescope in the framework of the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS).
We use the Light-Traces-Mass modeling technique to uncover sets of multiply
imaged galaxies and constrain the mass distribution of the clusters. Our SL
analysis reveals that both clusters have particularly large Einstein radii
($\theta_E>30"$ for a source redshift of $z_s=2$), providing fairly large areas
with high magnifications, useful for high-redshift galaxy searches ($\sim2$
arcmin$^{2}$ with $\mu>5$ to $\sim1$ arcmin$^{2}$ with $\mu>10$, similar to a
typical \textit{Hubble Frontier Fields} cluster). We also find that MACS
J0308.9+2645 hosts a promising, apparently bright (J$\sim23.2-24.6$ AB),
multiply imaged high-redshift candidate at $z\sim6.4$. These images are amongst
the brightest high-redshift candidates found in RELICS. Our mass models,
including magnification maps, are made publicly available for the community
through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.


RELICS: A Strong Lens Model for SPT-CLJ0615-5746, a z=0.972 Cluster

  We present a lens model for the cluster SPT-CLJ0615$-$5746, which is the
highest redshift ($z=0.972$) system in the Reionization of Lensing Clusters
Survey (RELICS), making it the highest redshift cluster for which a full strong
lens model is published. We identify three systems of multiply-imaged lensed
galaxies, two of which we spectroscopically confirm at $z=1.358$ and $z=4.013$,
which we use as constraints for the model. We find a foreground structure at
$z\sim0.4$, which we include as a second cluster-sized halo in one of our
models; however two different statistical tests find the best-fit model
consists of one cluster-sized halo combined with three individually optimized
galaxy-sized halos, as well as contributions from the cluster galaxies
themselves. We find the total projected mass density within $r=26.7"$ (the
region where the strong lensing constraints exist) to be
$M=2.51^{+0.15}_{-0.09}\times 10^{14}$~M$_{\odot}$. If we extrapolate out to
$r_{500}$, our projected mass density is consistent with the mass inferred from
weak lensing and from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
($M\sim10^{15}$~M$_{\odot}$). This cluster is lensing a previously reported
$z\sim10$ galaxy, which, if spectroscopically confirmed, will be the
highest-redshift strongly lensed galaxy known.


RELICS: High-Resolution Constraints on the Inner Mass Distribution of
  the z=0.83 Merging Cluster RXJ0152.7-1357 from strong lensing

  Strong gravitational lensing (SL) is a powerful means to map the distribution
of dark matter. In this work, we perform a SL analysis of the prominent X-ray
cluster RXJ0152.7-1357 (z=0.83, also known as CL 0152.7-1357) in \textit{Hubble
Space Telescope} images, taken in the framework of the Reionization Lensing
Cluster Survey (RELICS). On top of a previously known $z=3.93$ galaxy multiply
imaged by RXJ0152.7-1357, for which we identify an additional multiple image,
guided by a light-traces-mass approach we identify seven new sets of multiply
imaged background sources lensed by this cluster, spanning the redshift range
[1.79-3.93]. A total of 25 multiple images are seen over a small area of ~0.4
$arcmin^2$, allowing us to put relatively high-resolution constraints on the
inner matter distribution. Although modestly massive, the high degree of
substructure together with its very elongated shape make RXJ0152.7-1357 a very
efficient lens for its size. This cluster also comprises the third-largest
sample of z~6-7 candidates in the RELICS survey. Finally, we present a
comparison of our resulting mass distribution and magnification estimates with
those from a Lenstool model. These models are made publicly available through
the MAST archive.


Wide-Orbit Exoplanet Demographics

  The Kepler, K2 and TESS transit surveys are revolutionizing our understanding
of planets orbiting close to their host stars and our understanding of
exoplanet systems in general, but there remains a gap in our understanding of
wide-orbit planets. This gap in our understanding must be filled if we are to
understand planet formation and how it affects exoplanet habitability. We
summarize current and planned exoplanet detection programs using a variety of
methods: microlensing (including WFIRST), radial velocities, Gaia astrometry,
and direct imaging. Finally, we discuss the prospects for joint analyses using
results from multiple methods and obstacles that could hinder such analyses.
  We endorse the findings and recommendations published in the 2018 National
Academy report on Exoplanet Science Strategy. This white paper extends and
complements the material presented therein.


An RF-only ion-funnel for extraction from high-pressure gases

  An RF ion-funnel technique has been developed to extract ions from a
high-pressure (10 bar) noble-gas environment into vacuum ($10^{-6}$ mbar).
Detailed simulations have been performed and a prototype has been developed for
the purpose of extracting $^{136}$Ba ions from Xe gas with high efficiency.
With this prototype, ions have been extracted for the first time from
high-pressure xenon gas and argon gas. Systematic studies have been carried out
and compared to the simulations. This demonstration of extraction of ions with
mass comparable to that of the gas generating the high-pressure into vacuum has
applications to Ba tagging from a Xe-gas time-projection chamber (TPC) for
double beta decay as well as to the general problem of recovering trace amounts
of an ionized element in a heavy (m$>40$ u) carrier gas.


The Size, Shape, and Scattering of Sagittarius A* at 86 GHz: First VLBI
  with ALMA

  The Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is one of
the most promising targets to study the dynamics of black hole accretion and
outflow via direct imaging with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). At
3.5 mm (86 GHz), the emission from Sgr A* is resolvable with the Global
Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). We present the first observations of Sgr A* with
the phased Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) joining the
GMVA. Our observations achieve an angular resolution of ~87{\mu}as, improving
upon previous experiments by a factor of two. We reconstruct a first image of
the unscattered source structure of Sgr A* at 3.5 mm, mitigating effects of
interstellar scattering. The unscattered source has a major axis size of 120
$\pm$ 34{\mu}as (12 $\pm$ 3.4 Schwarzschild radii), and a symmetrical
morphology (axial ratio of 1.2$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$), which is further supported by
closure phases consistent with zero within 3{\sigma}. We show that multiple
disk-dominated models of Sgr A* match our observational constraints, while the
two jet-dominated models considered are constrained to small viewing angles.
Our long-baseline detections to ALMA also provide new constraints on the
scattering of Sgr A*, and we show that refractive scattering effects are likely
to be weak for images of Sgr A* at 1.3 mm with the Event Horizon Telescope. Our
results provide the most stringent constraints to date for the intrinsic
morphology and refractive scattering of Sgr A*, demonstrating the exceptional
contribution of ALMA to millimeter VLBI.


KELT-19Ab: A P~4.6 Day Hot Jupiter Transiting a Likely Am Star with a
  Distant Stellar Companion

  We present the discovery of the giant planet KELT-19Ab, which transits the
moderately bright $(\mathrm{V} \sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with an
orbital period of 4.61 days. We confirm the planetary nature of the companion
via a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<
4.1\,\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which
indicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda =
-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\rm{T_{eff}}
=7500 \pm 110\,\mathrm{K}$ host star has $\mathrm{M_*} =
1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\mathrm{R_*} = 1.83 \pm
0.10\,\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $\mathrm{R_P}=1.91 \pm
0.11\,\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times
10^{9}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibrium
temperature of $\rm{T_{EQ}} = \sim 1935\,\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo and
complete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm
2.0\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared to
other stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced
in metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely an
Am star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transiting
planet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system reveal
the existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at a
projected separation of $\approx 160\,\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocity
measurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to
have stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slow
rotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely to
have caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced the
transiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.


KELT-22Ab: A Massive Hot Jupiter Transiting a Near Solar Twin

  We present the discovery of KELT-22Ab, a hot Jupiter from the KELT-South
survey. KELT-22Ab transits the moderately bright ($V\sim 11.1$) Sun-like G2V
star TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 1.3866529 \pm
0.0000027 $ days, a radius of $R_{P} = 1.285_{-0.071}^{+0.12}~R_{J}$, and a
relatively large mass of $M_{P} = 3.47_{-0.14}^{+0.15}~ M_{J}$. The star has
$R_{\star} = 1.099_{-0.046}^{+0.079}~ R_{\odot}$, $M_{\star} =
1.092_{-0.041}^{+0.045}~ M_{\odot}$, ${T_{\rm eff}\,} = 5767_{-49}^{+50}~$ K,
${\log{g_\star}} = 4.393_{-0.060}^{+0.039}~$ (cgs), and [m/H] =
$+0.259_{-0.083}^{+0.085}~$, and thus, other than its slightly super-solar
metallicity, appears to be a near solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibits
kinematics and a Galactic orbit that are somewhat atypical for thin disk stars.
Nevertheless, the star is rotating quite rapidly for its estimated age, shows
evidence of chromospheric activity, and is somewhat metal rich. Imaging reveals
a slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projected
separation of 6\arcsec ($\sim$1400 AU). In addition to the orbital motion
caused by the transiting planet, we detect a possible linear trend in the
radial velocity of KELT-22A suggesting the presence of another relatively
nearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as a
consequence of the small semi-major axis of $a/R_{\star} = 4.97$), and is
mildly inflated. At such small separations, tidal forces become significant.
The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the rate of tidal
dissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces,
the semi-major axis of KELT-22Ab is decreasing rapidly, and is thus predicted
to spiral into the star within the next Gyr.


KELT-6b: A P~7.9 d Hot Saturn Transiting a Metal-Poor Star with a
  Long-Period Companion

  We report the discovery of KELT-6b, a mildly-inflated Saturn-mass planet
transiting a metal-poor host. The initial transit signal was identified in
KELT-North survey data, and the planetary nature of the occulter was
established using a combination of follow-up photometry, high-resolution
imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and precise radial velocity
measurements. The fiducial model from a global analysis including constraints
from isochrones indicates that the V=10.38 host star (BD+31 2447) is a mildly
evolved, late-F star with T_eff=6102 \pm 43 K, log(g_*)=4.07_{-0.07}^{+0.04}
and [Fe/H]=-0.28 \pm 0.04, with an inferred mass M_*=1.09 \pm 0.04 M_sun and
radius R_star=1.58_{-0.09}^{+0.16} R_sun. The planetary companion has mass
M_P=0.43 \pm 0.05 M_J, radius R_P=1.19_{-0.08}^{+0.13} R_J, surface gravity
log(g_P)=2.86_{-0.08}^{+0.06}, and density rho_P=0.31_{-0.08}^{+0.07}
g~cm^{-3}. The planet is on an orbit with semimajor axis a=0.079 \pm 0.001 AU
and eccentricity e=0.22_{-0.10}^{+0.12}, which is roughly consistent with
circular, and has ephemeris of T_c(BJD_TDB)=2456347.79679 \pm 0.00036 and
P=7.845631 \pm 0.000046 d. Equally plausible fits that employ empirical
constraints on the host star parameters rather than isochrones yield a larger
planet mass and radius by ~4-7%. KELT-6b has surface gravity and incident flux
similar to HD209458b, but orbits a host that is more metal poor than HD209458
by ~0.3 dex. Thus, the KELT-6 system offers an opportunity to perform a
comparative measurement of two similar planets in similar environments around
stars of very different metallicities. The precise radial velocity data also
reveal an acceleration indicative of a longer-period third body in the system,
although the companion is not detected in Keck adaptive optics images.
