IPED2: Inheritance Path based Pedigree Reconstruction Algorithm for  Complicated Pedigrees

  Reconstruction of family trees, or pedigree reconstruction, for a group ofindividuals is a fundamental problem in genetics. The problem is known to beNP-hard even for datasets known to only contain siblings. Some recent methodshave been developed to accurately and efficiently reconstruct pedigrees. Thesemethods, however, still consider relatively simple pedigrees, for example, theyare not able to handle half-sibling situations where a pair of individuals onlyshare one parent. In this work, we propose an efficient method, IPED2, based onour previous work, which specifically targets reconstruction of complicatedpedigrees that include half-siblings. We note that the presence ofhalf-siblings makes the reconstruction problem significantly more challengingwhich is why previous methods exclude the possibility of half-siblings. Weproposed a novel model as well as an efficient graph algorithm and experimentsshow that our algorithm achieves relatively accurate reconstruction. To ourknowledge, this is the first method that is able to handle pedigreereconstruction based on genotype data only when half-sibling exists in anygeneration of the pedigree.

A general framework for meta-analyzing dependent studies with  overlapping subjects in association mapping

  Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies is increasingly popular andmany meta-analytic methods have been recently proposed. A majority ofmeta-analytic methods combine information from multiple studies by assumingthat studies are independent since individuals collected in one study areunlikely to be collected again by another study. However, it has becomeincreasingly common to utilize the same control individuals among multiplestudies to reduce genotyping or sequencing cost. This causes those studies thatshare the same individuals to be dependent, and spurious associations may ariseif overlapping subjects are not taken into account in a meta-analysis. In thispaper, we propose a general framework for meta-analyzing dependent studies withoverlapping subjects. Given dependent studies, our approach "decouples" thestudies into independent studies such that meta-analysis methods assumingindependent studies can be applied. This enables many meta-analysis methods,such as the random effects model, to account for overlapping subjects. Anotheradvantage is that one can continue to use preferred software in the analysispipeline which may not support overlapping subjects. Using simulations and theWellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data, we show that our decouplingapproach allows both the fixed and the random effects models to account foroverlapping subjects while retaining desirable false positive rate and power.
