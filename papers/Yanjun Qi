Memory Matching Networks for Genomic Sequence Classification

  When analyzing the genome, researchers have discovered that proteins bind toDNA based on certain patterns of the DNA sequence known as "motifs". However,it is difficult to manually construct motifs due to their complexity. Recently,externally learned memory models have proven to be effective methods forreasoning over inputs and supporting sets. In this work, we present memorymatching networks (MMN) for classifying DNA sequences as protein binding sites.Our model learns a memory bank of encoded motifs, which are dynamic memorymodules, and then matches a new test sequence to each of the motifs to classifythe sequence as a binding or nonbinding site.

Style Transfer Generative Adversarial Networks: Learning to Play Chess  Differently

  The idea of style transfer has largely only been explored in image-basedtasks, which we attribute in part to the specific nature of loss functions usedfor style transfer. We propose a general formulation of style transfer as anextension of generative adversarial networks, by using a discriminator toregularize a generator with an otherwise separate loss function. We apply ourapproach to the task of learning to play chess in the style of a specificplayer, and present empirical evidence for the viability of our approach.

Feature Squeezing Mitigates and Detects Carlini/Wagner Adversarial  Examples

  Feature squeezing is a recently-introduced framework for mitigating anddetecting adversarial examples. In previous work, we showed that it iseffective against several earlier methods for generating adversarial examples.In this short note, we report on recent results showing that simple featuresqueezing techniques also make deep learning models significantly more robustagainst the Carlini/Wagner attacks, which are the best known adversarialmethods discovered to date.

MUST-CNN: A Multilayer Shift-and-Stitch Deep Convolutional Architecture  for Sequence-based Protein Structure Prediction

  Predicting protein properties such as solvent accessibility and secondarystructure from its primary amino acid sequence is an important task inbioinformatics. Recently, a few deep learning models have surpassed thetraditional window based multilayer perceptron. Taking inspiration from theimage classification domain we propose a deep convolutional neural networkarchitecture, MUST-CNN, to predict protein properties. This architecture uses anovel multilayer shift-and-stitch (MUST) technique to generate fully denseper-position predictions on protein sequences. Our model is significantlysimpler than the state-of-the-art, yet achieves better results. By combiningMUST and the efficient convolution operation, we can consider far moreparameters while retaining very fast prediction speeds. We beat thestate-of-the-art performance on two large protein property prediction datasets.

A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Learning Multiple Related Sparse  Gaussian Graphical Models

  Estimating multiple sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (sGGMs) jointly for manyrelated tasks (large $K$) under a high-dimensional (large $p$) situation is animportant task. Most previous studies for the joint estimation of multiplesGGMs rely on penalized log-likelihood estimators that involve expensive anddifficult non-smooth optimizations. We propose a novel approach, FASJEM for\underline{fa}st and \underline{s}calable \underline{j}ointstructure-\underline{e}stimation of \underline{m}ultiple sGGMs at a largescale. As the first study of joint sGGM using the Elementary Estimatorframework, our work has three major contributions: (1) We solve FASJEM throughan entry-wise manner which is parallelizable. (2) We choose a proximalalgorithm to optimize FASJEM. This improves the computational efficiency from$O(Kp^3)$ to $O(Kp^2)$ and reduces the memory requirement from $O(Kp^2)$ to$O(K)$. (3) We theoretically prove that FASJEM achieves a consistent estimationwith a convergence rate of $O(\log(Kp)/n_{tot})$. On several synthetic and fourreal-world datasets, FASJEM shows significant improvements over baselines onaccuracy, computational complexity, and memory costs.

Adversarial-Playground: A Visualization Suite for Adversarial Sample  Generation

  With growing interest in adversarial machine learning, it is important formachine learning practitioners and users to understand how their models may beattacked. We propose a web-based visualization tool, Adversarial-Playground, todemonstrate the efficacy of common adversarial methods against a deep neuralnetwork (DNN) model, built on top of the TensorFlow library.Adversarial-Playground provides users an efficient and effective experience inexploring techniques generating adversarial examples, which are inputs craftedby an adversary to fool a machine learning system. To enableAdversarial-Playground to generate quick and accurate responses for users, weuse two primary tactics: (1) We propose a faster variant of thestate-of-the-art Jacobian saliency map approach that maintains a comparableevasion rate. (2) Our visualization does not transmit the generated adversarialimages to the client, but rather only the matrix describing the sample and thevector representing classification likelihoods.  The source code along with the data from all of our experiments are availableat \url{https://github.com/QData/AdversarialDNN-Playground}.

A Constrained, Weighted-L1 Minimization Approach for Joint Discovery of  Heterogeneous Neural Connectivity Graphs

  Determining functional brain connectivity is crucial to understanding thebrain and neural differences underlying disorders such as autism. Recentstudies have used Gaussian graphical models to learn brain connectivity viastatistical dependencies across brain regions from neuroimaging. However,previous studies often fail to properly incorporate priors tailored toneuroscience, such as preferring shorter connections. To remedy this problem,the paper here introduces a novel, weighted-$\ell_1$, multi-task graphicalmodel (W-SIMULE). This model elegantly incorporates a flexible prior, alongwith a parallelizable formulation. Additionally, W-SIMULE extends theoften-used Gaussian assumption, leading to considerable performance increases.Here, applications to fMRI data show that W-SIMULE succeeds in determiningfunctional connectivity in terms of (1) log-likelihood, (2) finding edges thatdifferentiate groups, and (3) classifying different groups based on theirconnectivity, achieving 58.6\% accuracy on the ABIDE dataset. Havingestablished W-SIMULE's effectiveness, it links four key areas to autism, all ofwhich are consistent with the literature. Due to its elegant domain adaptivity,W-SIMULE can be readily applied to various data types to effectively estimateconnectivity.

Fast and Scalable Learning of Sparse Changes in High-Dimensional  Gaussian Graphical Model Structure

  We focus on the problem of estimating the change in the dependency structuresof two $p$-dimensional Gaussian Graphical models (GGMs). Previous studies forsparse change estimation in GGMs involve expensive and difficult non-smoothoptimization. We propose a novel method, DIFFEE for estimating DIFFerentialnetworks via an Elementary Estimator under a high-dimensional situation. DIFFEEis solved through a faster and closed form solution that enables it to work inlarge-scale settings. We conduct a rigorous statistical analysis showing thatsurprisingly DIFFEE achieves the same asymptotic convergence rates as thestate-of-the-art estimators that are much more difficult to compute. Ourexperimental results on multiple synthetic datasets and one real-world dataabout brain connectivity show strong performance improvements over baselines,as well as significant computational benefits.

Deep Motif: Visualizing Genomic Sequence Classifications

  This paper applies a deep convolutional/highway MLP framework to classifygenomic sequences on the transcription factor binding site task. To make themodel understandable, we propose an optimization driven strategy to extract"motifs", or symbolic patterns which visualize the positive class learned bythe network. We show that our system, Deep Motif (DeMo), extracts motifs thatare similar to, and in some cases outperform the current well known motifs. Inaddition, we find that a deeper model consisting of multiple convolutional andhighway layers can outperform a single convolutional and fully connected layerin the previous state-of-the-art.

A constrained L1 minimization approach for estimating multiple Sparse  Gaussian or Nonparanormal Graphical Models

  Identifying context-specific entity networks from aggregated data is animportant task, arising often in bioinformatics and neuroimaging.Computationally, this task can be formulated as jointly estimating multipledifferent, but related, sparse Undirected Graphical Models (UGM) fromaggregated samples across several contexts. Previous joint-UGM studies havemostly focused on sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (sGGMs) and can't identifycontext-specific edge patterns directly. We, therefore, propose a novelapproach, SIMULE (detecting Shared and Individual parts of MULtiple graphsExplicitly) to learn multi-UGM via a constrained L1 minimization. SIMULEautomatically infers both specific edge patterns that are unique to eachcontext and shared interactions preserved among all the contexts. Through theL1 constrained formulation, this problem is cast as multiple independentsubtasks of linear programming that can be solved efficiently in parallel. Inaddition to Gaussian data, SIMULE can also handle multivariate Nonparanormaldata that greatly relaxes the normality assumption that many real-worldapplications do not follow. We provide a novel theoretical proof showing thatSIMULE achieves a consistent result at the rate O(log(Kp)/n_{tot}). On multiplesynthetic datasets and two biomedical datasets, SIMULE shows significantimprovement over state-of-the-art multi-sGGM and single-UGM baselines.

Deep Motif Dashboard: Visualizing and Understanding Genomic Sequences  Using Deep Neural Networks

  Deep neural network (DNN) models have recently obtained state-of-the-artprediction accuracy for the transcription factor binding (TFBS) siteclassification task. However, it remains unclear how these approaches identifymeaningful DNA sequence signals and give insights as to why TFs bind to certainlocations. In this paper, we propose a toolkit called the Deep Motif Dashboard(DeMo Dashboard) which provides a suite of visualization strategies to extractmotifs, or sequence patterns from deep neural network models for TFBSclassification. We demonstrate how to visualize and understand three importantDNN models: convolutional, recurrent, and convolutional-recurrent networks. Ourfirst visualization method is finding a test sequence's saliency map which usesfirst-order derivatives to describe the importance of each nucleotide in makingthe final prediction. Second, considering recurrent models make predictions ina temporal manner (from one end of a TFBS sequence to the other), we introducetemporal output scores, indicating the prediction score of a model over timefor a sequential input. Lastly, a class-specific visualization strategy findsthe optimal input sequence for a given TFBS positive class via stochasticgradient optimization. Our experimental results indicate that aconvolutional-recurrent architecture performs the best among the threearchitectures. The visualization techniques indicate that CNN-RNN makespredictions by modeling both motifs as well as dependencies among them.

A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against  Adversarial Examples

  Most machine learning classifiers, including deep neural networks, arevulnerable to adversarial examples. Such inputs are typically generated byadding small but purposeful modifications that lead to incorrect outputs whileimperceptible to human eyes. The goal of this paper is not to introduce asingle method, but to make theoretical steps towards fully understandingadversarial examples. By using concepts from topology, our theoretical analysisbrings forth the key reasons why an adversarial example can fool a classifier($f_1$) and adds its oracle ($f_2$, like human eyes) in such analysis. Byinvestigating the topological relationship between two (pseudo)metric spacescorresponding to predictor $f_1$ and oracle $f_2$, we develop necessary andsufficient conditions that can determine if $f_1$ is always robust(strong-robust) against adversarial examples according to $f_2$. Interestinglyour theorems indicate that just one unnecessary feature can make $f_1$ notstrong-robust, and the right feature representation learning is the key togetting a classifier that is both accurate and strong-robust.

GaKCo: a Fast GApped k-mer string Kernel using COunting

  String Kernel (SK) techniques, especially those using gapped $k$-mers asfeatures (gk), have obtained great success in classifying sequences like DNA,protein, and text. However, the state-of-the-art gk-SK runs extremely slow whenwe increase the dictionary size ($\Sigma$) or allow more mismatches ($M$). Thisis because current gk-SK uses a trie-based algorithm to calculate co-occurrenceof mismatched substrings resulting in a time cost proportional to$O(\Sigma^{M})$. We propose a \textbf{fast} algorithm for calculating\underline{Ga}pped $k$-mer \underline{K}ernel using \underline{Co}unting(GaKCo). GaKCo uses associative arrays to calculate the co-occurrence ofsubstrings using cumulative counting. This algorithm is fast, scalable tolarger $\Sigma$ and $M$, and naturally parallelizable. We provide a rigorousasymptotic analysis that compares GaKCo with the state-of-the-art gk-SK.Theoretically, the time cost of GaKCo is independent of the $\Sigma^{M}$ termthat slows down the trie-based approach. Experimentally, we observe that GaKCoachieves the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art and outperforms its speed byfactors of 2, 100, and 4, on classifying sequences of DNA (5 datasets), protein(12 datasets), and character-based English text (2 datasets), respectively.  GaKCo is shared as an open source tool at\url{https://github.com/QData/GaKCo-SVM}

Attend and Predict: Understanding Gene Regulation by Selective Attention  on Chromatin

  The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enable aflood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried tounderstand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scalechromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learningtasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured,high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand whatare the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies eitherfailed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separatefeature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents anattention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses aunified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatinfactors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy ofmultiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals andto model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrometrains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling itto attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positionsper mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) inhuman. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attentionscores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art featurevisualization methods such as saliency map.

Adversarial-Playground: A Visualization Suite Showing How Adversarial  Examples Fool Deep Learning

  Recent studies have shown that attackers can force deep learning models tomisclassify so-called "adversarial examples": maliciously generated imagesformed by making imperceptible modifications to pixel values. With growinginterest in deep learning for security applications, it is important forsecurity experts and users of machine learning to recognize how learningsystems may be attacked. Due to the complex nature of deep learning, it ischallenging to understand how deep models can be fooled by adversarialexamples. Thus, we present a web-based visualization tool,Adversarial-Playground, to demonstrate the efficacy of common adversarialmethods against a convolutional neural network (CNN) system.Adversarial-Playground is educational, modular and interactive. (1) It enablesnon-experts to compare examples visually and to understand why an adversarialexample can fool a CNN-based image classifier. (2) It can help security expertsexplore more vulnerability of deep learning as a software module. (3) Buildingan interactive visualization is challenging in this domain due to the largefeature space of image classification (generating adversarial examples is slowin general and visualizing images are costly). Through multiple novel designchoices, our tool can provide fast and accurate responses to user requests.Empirically, we find that our client-server division strategy reduced theresponse time by an average of 1.5 seconds per sample. Our other innovation, afaster variant of JSMA evasion algorithm, empirically performed twice as fastas JSMA and yet maintains a comparable evasion rate.

Prototype Matching Networks for Large-Scale Multi-label Genomic Sequence  Classification

  One of the fundamental tasks in understanding genomics is the problem ofpredicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). With more than hundredsof Transcription Factors (TFs) as labels, genomic-sequence based TFBSprediction is a challenging multi-label classification task. There are twomajor biological mechanisms for TF binding: (1) sequence-specific bindingpatterns on genomes known as "motifs" and (2) interactions among TFs known asco-binding effects. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, thePrototype Matching Network (PMN) to mimic the TF binding mechanisms. Our PMNmodel automatically extracts prototypes ("motif"-like features) for each TFthrough a novel prototype-matching loss. Borrowing ideas from few-shot matchingmodels, we use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn howTFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with$2.1$ $million$ genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines andvalidates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the firstdeep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considersTF-TF interactions for large-scale TFBS prediction. Not only is the proposedarchitecture accurate, but it also models the underlying biology.

Black-box Generation of Adversarial Text Sequences to Evade Deep  Learning Classifiers

  Although various techniques have been proposed to generate adversarialsamples for white-box attacks on text, little attention has been paid toblack-box attacks, which are more realistic scenarios. In this paper, wepresent a novel algorithm, DeepWordBug, to effectively generate small textperturbations in a black-box setting that forces a deep-learning classifier tomisclassify a text input. We employ novel scoring strategies to identify thecritical tokens that, if modified, cause the classifier to make an incorrectprediction. Simple character-level transformations are applied to thehighest-ranked tokens in order to minimize the edit distance of theperturbation, yet change the original classification. We evaluated DeepWordBugon eight real-world text datasets, including text classification, sentimentanalysis, and spam detection. We compare the result of DeepWordBug with twobaselines: Random (Black-box) and Gradient (White-box). Our experimentalresults indicate that DeepWordBug reduces the prediction accuracy of currentstate-of-the-art deep-learning models, including a decrease of 68\% on averagefor a Word-LSTM model and 48\% on average for a Char-CNN model.

A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Integrating Additional Knowledge  in Learning Multiple Related Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models

  We consider the problem of including additional knowledge in estimatingsparse Gaussian graphical models (sGGMs) from aggregated samples, arising oftenin bioinformatics and neuroimaging applications. Previous joint sGGM estimatorseither fail to use existing knowledge or cannot scale-up to many tasks (large$K$) under a high-dimensional (large $p$) situation. In this paper, we proposea novel \underline{J}oint \underline{E}lementary \underline{E}stimatorincorporating additional \underline{K}nowledge (JEEK) to infer multiple relatedsparse Gaussian Graphical models from large-scale heterogeneous data. Usingdomain knowledge as weights, we design a novel hybrid norm as the minimizationobjective to enforce the superposition of two weighted sparsity constraints,one on the shared interactions and the other on the task-specific structuralpatterns. This enables JEEK to elegantly consider various forms of existingknowledge based on the domain at hand and avoid the need to designknowledge-specific optimization. JEEK is solved through a fast and entry-wiseparallelizable solution that largely improves the computational efficiency ofthe state-of-the-art $O(p^5K^4)$ to $O(p^2K^4)$. We conduct a rigorousstatistical analysis showing that JEEK achieves the same convergence rate$O(\log(Kp)/n_{tot})$ as the state-of-the-art estimators that are much harderto compute. Empirically, on multiple synthetic datasets and two real-worlddata, JEEK outperforms the speed of the state-of-arts significantly whileachieving the same level of prediction accuracy.

DeepDiff: Deep-learning for predicting Differential gene expression from  histone modifications

  Computational methods that predict differential gene expression from histonemodification signals are highly desirable for understanding how histonemodifications control the functional heterogeneity of cells through influencingdifferential gene regulation. Recent studies either failed to capturecombinatorial effects on differential prediction or primarily only focused oncell type-specific analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel attention-baseddeep learning architecture, DeepDiff, that provides a unified and end-to-endsolution to model and to interpret how dependencies among histone modificationscontrol the differential patterns of gene regulation. DeepDiff uses a hierarchyof multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the spatialstructure of input signals and to model how various histone modificationscooperate automatically. We introduce and train two levels of attention jointlywith the target prediction, enabling DeepDiff to attend differentially torelevant modifications and to locate important genome positions for eachmodification. Additionally, DeepDiff introduces a novel deep-learning basedmulti-task formulation to use the cell-type-specific gene expressionpredictions as auxiliary tasks, encouraging richer feature embeddings in ourprimary task of differential expression prediction. Using data from RoadmapEpigenomics Project (REMC) for ten different pairs of cell types, we show thatDeepDiff significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines fordifferential gene expression prediction. The learned attention weights arevalidated by observations from previous studies about how epigenetic mechanismsconnect to differential gene expression. Codes and results are available at\url{deepchrome.org}

Unsupervised Feature Learning by Deep Sparse Coding

  In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised feature learning framework,namely Deep Sparse Coding (DeepSC), that extends sparse coding to a multi-layerarchitecture for visual object recognition tasks. The main innovation of theframework is that it connects the sparse-encoders from different layers by asparse-to-dense module. The sparse-to-dense module is a composition of a localspatial pooling step and a low-dimensional embedding process, which takesadvantage of the spatial smoothness information in the image. As a result, thenew method is able to learn several levels of sparse representation of theimage which capture features at a variety of abstraction levels andsimultaneously preserve the spatial smoothness between the neighboring imagepatches. Combining the feature representations from multiple layers, DeepSCachieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple object recognition tasks.

Electrical Oscillation in Pt/VO2 Bilayer Strips

  We report on the observation of stable electrical oscillation in Pt/VO2bilayer strips, in which the Pt overlayer serves the dual purposes of heatingup the VO2 and weakening the electric field in the VO2 layer. Systematicmeasurements in an ultrahigh vacuum nanoprobe system show that the oscillationfrequency increases with the bias current and/or with decreasing devicedimension. In contrast to most VO2-based oscillators reported to date, whichare electrically triggered, current-induced Joule heating in the Pt overlayeris found to play a dominant role in the generation of oscillation in Pt/VO2bilayers. A simple model involving thermally triggered transition of VO2 on aheat sink is able to account for the experimental observations. The results inthis work provide an alternative view of the triggering mechanism in VO2-basedoscillators.

Transfer String Kernel for Cross-Context DNA-Protein Binding Prediction

  Through sequence-based classification, this paper tries to accurately predictthe DNA binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) in an unannotated cellularcontext. Related methods in the literature fail to perform such predictionsaccurately, since they do not consider sample distribution shift of sequencesegments from an annotated (source) context to an unannotated (target) context.We, therefore, propose a method called "Transfer String Kernel" (TSK) thatachieves improved prediction of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) usingknowledge transfer via cross-context sample adaptation. TSK maps sequencesegments to a high-dimensional feature space using a discriminative mismatchstring kernel framework. In this high-dimensional space, labeled examples ofthe source context are re-weighted so that the revised sample distributionmatches the target context more closely. We have experimentally verified TSKfor TFBS identifications on fourteen different TFs under a cross-organismsetting. We find that TSK consistently outperforms the state-of the-art TFBStools, especially when working with TFs whose binding sequences are notconserved across contexts. We also demonstrate the generalizability of TSK byshowing its cutting-edge performance on a different set of cross-context tasksfor the MHC peptide binding predictions.

DeepCloak: Masking Deep Neural Network Models for Robustness Against  Adversarial Samples

  Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable toadversarial samples: maliciously-perturbed samples crafted to yield incorrectmodel outputs. Such attacks can severely undermine DNN systems, particularly insecurity-sensitive settings. It was observed that an adversary could easilygenerate adversarial samples by making a small perturbation on irrelevantfeature dimensions that are unnecessary for the current classification task. Toovercome this problem, we introduce a defensive mechanism called DeepCloak. Byidentifying and removing unnecessary features in a DNN model, DeepCloak limitsthe capacity an attacker can use generating adversarial samples and thereforeincrease the robustness against such inputs. Comparing with other defensiveapproaches, DeepCloak is easy to implement and computationally efficient.Experimental results show that DeepCloak can increase the performance ofstate-of-the-art DNN models against adversarial samples.

Unveiling the role of Co-O-Mg bond in magnetic anisotropy of Pt/Co/MgO  using atomically controlled deposition and in-situ electrical measurement

  Despite the crucial role of interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy inCo(Fe)/MgO based magnetic tunnel junction, the underlying mechanism is stillbeing debated. Here, we report an anatomical study of oxygen and Mg effect onPt/Co bilayers through repeated in-situ anomalous Hall effect measurements,controlled oxygen exposure and Mg deposition in an ultrahigh vacuum system. Wefound that chemisorbed oxygen not only quenches the effective magnetic momentof the Co surface layer, but also softens its magnetic anisotropy. However, asubsequent Mg dusting on the oxygen pre-exposed Pt/Co surface can recover themagnetic anisotropy. The ab initio calculations on the exchange splitting andorbital hybridization near the Fermi level give a clear physical explanation ofthe experimental observations. Our results suggest that Co(Fe)-O-M bond plays amore important role than the widely perceived Co(Fe)-O bond does in realizinginterfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Co(Fe)/MgO heterostructures.

Feature Squeezing: Detecting Adversarial Examples in Deep Neural  Networks

  Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in manytasks, they can often be fooled by \emph{adversarial examples} that aregenerated by adding small but purposeful distortions to natural examples.Previous studies to defend against adversarial examples mostly focused onrefining the DNN models, but have either shown limited success or requiredexpensive computation. We propose a new strategy, \emph{feature squeezing},that can be used to harden DNN models by detecting adversarial examples.Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary bycoalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in theoriginal space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction onthe original input with that on squeezed inputs, feature squeezing detectsadversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paperexplores two feature squeezing methods: reducing the color bit depth of eachpixel and spatial smoothing. These simple strategies are inexpensive andcomplementary to other defenses, and can be combined in a joint detectionframework to achieve high detection rates against state-of-the-art attacks.

Reconciling Enumerative and Symbolic Search in Syntax-Guided Synthesis

  Syntax-guided synthesis aims to find a program satisfying semanticspecification as well as user-provided structural hypothesis. For syntax-guidedsynthesis there are two main search strategies: concrete search, whichsystematically or stochastically enumerates all possible solutions, andsymbolic search, which interacts with a constraint solver to solve thesynthesis problem. In this paper, we propose a concolic synthesis frameworkwhich combines the best of the two worlds. Based on a decision treerepresentation, our framework works by enumerating tree heights from thesmallest possible one to larger ones. For each fixed height, the frameworksymbolically searches a solution through the counterexample-guided inductivesynthesis approach. To compensate the exponential blow-up problem with theconcolic synthesis framework, we identify two fragments of synthesis problemsand develop purely symbolic and more efficient procedures. The two fragmentsare decidable as these procedures are terminating and complete. We implementedour synthesis procedures and compared with state-of-the-art synthesizers on arange of benchmarks. Experiments show that our algorithms are promising.

Cancer Diagnosis with QUIRE: QUadratic Interactions among infoRmative  fEatures

  Responsible for many complex human diseases including cancers, disrupted orabnormal gene interactions can be identified through their expression changescorrelating with the progression of a disease. However, the examination of allpossible combinatorial interactions between gene features in a genome-widecase-control study is computationally infeasible as the search space isexponential in nature.  In this paper, we propose a novel computational approach, QUIRE, to identifydiscriminative complex interactions among informative gene features for cancerdiagnosis. QUIRE works in two stages, where it first identifies functionallyrelevant feature groups for the disease and, then explores the search spacecapturing the combinatorial relationships among the genes from the selectedinformative groups. Using QUIRE, we explore the differential patterns and theinteractions among informative gene features in three different types ofcancers, Renal Cell Carcinoma(RCC), Ovarian Cancer(OVC) and Colorectal Cancer(CRC). Our experimental results show that QUIRE identifies gene-geneinteractions that can better identify the different cancer stages of samplesand can predict CRC recurrence and death from CRC more successfully, ascompared to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods. A literaturesurvey shows that many of the interactions identified by QUIRE play importantroles in the development of cancer.

DeepChrome: Deep-learning for predicting gene expression from histone  modifications

  Motivation: Histone modifications are among the most important factors thatcontrol gene regulation. Computational methods that predict gene expressionfrom histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding theircombinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifyingthe relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levelseither failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methodsthat separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops aunified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network toclassify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system,called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions amongimportant features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactionsamong histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based techniquethat generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This providesan intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulategenes. Results: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art modelslike Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expressionclassification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database. The outputof our visualization technique not only validates the previous observations butalso allows novel insights about combinatorial interactions among histonemodification marks, some of which have recently been observed by experimentalstudies.

Data Priming Network for Automatic Check-Out

  Automatic Check-Out (ACO) receives increased interests in recent years. Animportant component of the ACO system is the visual item counting, whichrecognize the categories and counts of the items chosen by the customers.However, the training of such a system is challenged by the domain adaptationproblem, in which the training data are images from isolated items while thetesting images are for collections of items. Existing methods solve thisproblem with data augmentation using synthesized images, but the imagesynthesis leads to unreal images that affect the training process. In thispaper, we propose a new data priming method to solve the domain adaptationproblem. Specifically, we first use pre-augmentation data priming, in which weremove distracting background from the training images and select images withrealistic view angles by the pose pruning method. In the post-augmentationstep, we train a data priming network using detection and countingcollaborative learning, and select more reliable images from testing data totrain the final visual item tallying network. Experiments on the large scaleRetail Product Checkout (RPC) dataset demonstrate the superiority of theproposed method, i.e., we achieve 80.51% checkout accuracy compared with 56.68%of the baseline methods.
