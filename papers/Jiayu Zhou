The Multilevel Finite Element Discretizations Based on Local  Defect-Correction for Nonsymmetric Eigenvalue Problems

  Based on the work of Xu and Zhou [Math.Comput., 69(2000), pp.881-909], weestablish new three-level and multilevel finite element discretizations bylocal defect-correction technique. Theoretical analysis and numericalexperiments show that the schemes are simple and easy to carry out, and can beused to solve singular nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems efficiently. We alsodiscuss the local error estimates of finite element approximations; it's a newfeature here that the estimates apply to the local domains containing cornerpoints.

Decentralized Recommender Systems

  This paper proposes a decentralized recommender system by formulating thepopular collaborative filleting (CF) model into a decentralized matrixcompletion form over a set of users. In such a way, data storages andcomputations are fully distributed. Each user could exchange limitedinformation with its local neighborhood, and thus it avoids the centralizedfusion. Advantages of the proposed system include a protection on user privacy,as well as better scalability and robustness. We compare our proposed algorithmwith several state-of-the-art algorithms on the FlickerUserFavor dataset, anddemonstrate that the decentralized algorithm can gain a competitive performanceto others.

Distributed Data Vending on Blockchain

  Recent advances in blockchain technologies have provided excitingopportunities for decentralized applications. Specifically, blockchain-basedsmart contracts enable credible transactions without authorized third parties.The attractive properties of smart contracts facilitate distributed datavending, allowing for proprietary data to be securely exchanged on ablockchain. Distributed data vending can transform domains such as healthcareby encouraging data distribution from owners and enabling large-scale dataaggregation. However, one key challenge in distributed data vending is thetrade-off dilemma between the effectiveness of data retrieval, and the leakagerisk from indexing the data. In this paper, we propose a framework fordistributed data vending through a combination of data embedding and similaritylearning. We illustrate our framework through a practical scenario ofdistributing and aggregating electronic medical records on a blockchain.Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Using Inverse lambda and Generalization to Translate English to Formal  Languages

  We present a system to translate natural language sentences to formulas in aformal or a knowledge representation language. Our system uses two inverselambda-calculus operators and using them can take as input the semanticrepresentation of some words, phrases and sentences and from that derive thesemantic representation of other words and phrases. Our inverse lambda operatorworks on many formal languages including first order logic, database querylanguages and answer set programming. Our system uses a syntactic combinatorialcategorial parser to parse natural language sentences and also to construct thesemantic meaning of the sentences as directed by their parsing. The same parseris used for both. In addition to the inverse lambda-calculus operators, oursystem uses a notion of generalization to learn semantic representation ofwords from the semantic representation of other words that are of the samecategory. Together with this, we use an existing statistical learning approachto assign weights to deal with multiple meanings of words. Our system producesimproved results on standard corpora on natural language interfaces for robotcommand and control and database queries.

A Safe Screening Rule for Sparse Logistic Regression

  The l1-regularized logistic regression (or sparse logistic regression) is awidely used method for simultaneous classification and feature selection.Although many recent efforts have been devoted to its efficient implementation,its application to high dimensional data still poses significant challenges. Inthis paper, we present a fast and effective sparse logistic regressionscreening rule (Slores) to identify the 0 components in the solution vector,which may lead to a substantial reduction in the number of features to beentered to the optimization. An appealing feature of Slores is that the dataset needs to be scanned only once to run the screening and its computationalcost is negligible compared to that of solving the sparse logistic regressionproblem. Moreover, Slores is independent of solvers for sparse logisticregression, thus Slores can be integrated with any existing solver to improvethe efficiency. We have evaluated Slores using high-dimensional data sets fromdifferent applications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Sloresoutperforms the existing state-of-the-art screening rules and the efficiency ofsolving sparse logistic regression is improved by one magnitude in general.

Physical Design and Monte Carlo Simulations of a Space Radiation  Detector onboard the SJ-10 satellite

  A radiation gene box (RGB) onboard the SJ-10 satellite is a device carryingmice and drosophila cells to determine the biological effects of spaceradiation environment. The shielded fluxes of different radioactive sourceswere calculated and the linear energy transfers of gamma-rays, electrons,protons and alpha-particles in tissue were acquired using A-150tissue-equivalent plastic. Then, a conceptual model of a space radiationinstrument employing three semiconductor sub-detectors for deriving the chargedand uncharged radiation environment of the RGB was designed. The energydepositions in the three sub-detectors were classified into fifteen channels(bins) in an algorithm derived from the Monte Carlo method. The physicalfeasibility of the conceptual instrument was also verified by Monte Carlosimulations.

Learning A Task-Specific Deep Architecture For Clustering

  While sparse coding-based clustering methods have shown to be successful,their bottlenecks in both efficiency and scalability limit the practical usage.In recent years, deep learning has been proved to be a highly effective,efficient and scalable feature learning tool. In this paper, we propose toemulate the sparse coding-based clustering pipeline in the context of deeplearning, leading to a carefully crafted deep model benefiting from both. Afeed-forward network structure, named TAGnet, is constructed based on agraph-regularized sparse coding algorithm. It is then trained withtask-specific loss functions from end to end. We discover that connecting deeplearning to sparse coding benefits not only the model performance, but also itsinitialization and interpretation. Moreover, by introducing auxiliaryclustering tasks to the intermediate feature hierarchy, we formulate DTAGnetand obtain a further performance boost. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatthe proposed model gains remarkable margins over several state-of-the-artmethods.

Collaborative Deep Reinforcement Learning

  Besides independent learning, human learning process is highly improved bysummarizing what has been learned, communicating it with peers, andsubsequently fusing knowledge from different sources to assist the currentlearning goal. This collaborative learning procedure ensures that the knowledgeis shared, continuously refined, and concluded from different perspectives toconstruct a more profound understanding. The idea of knowledge transfer has ledto many advances in machine learning and data mining, but significantchallenges remain, especially when it comes to reinforcement learning,heterogeneous model structures, and different learning tasks. Motivated byhuman collaborative learning, in this paper we propose a collaborative deepreinforcement learning (CDRL) framework that performs adaptive knowledgetransfer among heterogeneous learning agents. Specifically, the proposed CDRLconducts a novel deep knowledge distillation method to address theheterogeneity among different learning tasks with a deep alignment network.Furthermore, we present an efficient collaborative Asynchronous AdvantageActor-Critic (cA3C) algorithm to incorporate deep knowledge distillation intothe online training of agents, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the CDRLframework using extensive empirical evaluation on OpenAI gym.

Two Birds with One Stone: Transforming and Generating Facial Images with  Iterative GAN

  Generating high fidelity identity-preserving faces with different facialattributes has a wide range of applications. Although a number of generativemodels have been developed to tackle this problem, there is still much room forfurther improvement.In paticular, the current solutions usually ignore theperceptual information of images, which we argue that it benefits the output ofa high-quality image while preserving the identity information, especially infacial attributes learning area.To this end, we propose to train GANiteratively via regularizing the min-max process with an integrated loss, whichincludes not only the per-pixel loss but also the perceptual loss. In contrastto the existing methods only deal with either image generation ortransformation, our proposed iterative architecture can achieve both of them.Experiments on the multi-label facial dataset CelebA demonstrate that theproposed model has excellent performance on recognizing multiple attributes,generating a high-quality image, and transforming image with controllableattributes.

Efficient Large-Scale Fleet Management via Multi-Agent Deep  Reinforcement Learning

  Large-scale online ride-sharing platforms have substantially transformed ourlives by reallocating transportation resources to alleviate traffic congestionand promote transportation efficiency. An efficient fleet management strategynot only can significantly improve the utilization of transportation resourcesbut also increase the revenue and customer satisfaction. It is a challengingtask to design an effective fleet management strategy that can adapt to anenvironment involving complex dynamics between demand and supply. Existingstudies usually work on a simplified problem setting that can hardly capturethe complicated stochastic demand-supply variations in high-dimensional space.In this paper we propose to tackle the large-scale fleet management problemusing reinforcement learning, and propose a contextual multi-agentreinforcement learning framework including two concrete algorithms, namelycontextual deep Q-learning and contextual multi-agent actor-critic, to achieveexplicit coordination among a large number of agents adaptive to differentcontexts. We show significant improvements of the proposed framework overstate-of-the-art approaches through extensive empirical studies.

Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network

  Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants have recently attractedintensive research interests due to their elegant theoretical foundation andexcellent empirical performance as generative models. These tools provide apromising direction in the studies where data availability is limited. Onecommon issue in GANs is that the density of the learned generative distributioncould concentrate on the training data points, meaning that they can easilyremember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks.This becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to private or sensitive datasuch as patient medical records, and the concentration of distribution maydivulge critical patient information. To address this issue, in this paper wepropose a differentially private GAN (DPGAN) model, in which we achievedifferential privacy in GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradientsduring the learning procedure. We provide rigorous proof for the privacyguarantee, as well as comprehensive empirical evidence to support our analysis,where we demonstrate that our method can generate high quality data points at areasonable privacy level.

Drug Similarity Integration Through Attentive Multi-view Graph  Auto-Encoders

  Drug similarity has been studied to support downstream clinical tasks such asinferring novel properties of drugs (e.g. side effects, indications,interactions) from known properties. The growing availability of new types ofdrug features brings the opportunity of learning a more comprehensive andaccurate drug similarity that represents the full spectrum of underlying drugrelations. However, it is challenging to integrate these heterogeneous, noisy,nonlinear-related information to learn accurate similarity measures especiallywhen labels are scarce. Moreover, there is a trade-off between accuracy andinterpretability. In this paper, we propose to learn accurate and interpretablesimilarity measures from multiple types of drug features. In particular, wemodel the integration using multi-view graph auto-encoders, and add attentivemechanism to determine the weights for each view with respect to correspondingtasks and features for better interpretability. Our model has flexible designfor both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Experimental resultsdemonstrated significant predictive accuracy improvement. Case studies alsoshowed better model capacity (e.g. embed node features) and interpretability.

Multi-View Graph Convolutional Network and Its Applications on  Neuroimage Analysis for Parkinson's Disease

  Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerativediseases that affects tens of millions of Americans. PD is highly progressiveand heterogeneous. Quite a few studies have been conducted in recent years onpredictive or disease progression modeling of PD using clinical and biomarkersdata. Neuroimaging, as another important information source forneurodegenerative disease, has also arisen considerable interests from the PDcommunity. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method based on GraphConvolutional Networks (GCN) for fusing multiple modalities of brain images inrelationship prediction which is useful for distinguishing PD cases fromcontrols. On Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, ourapproach achieved $0.9537\pm 0.0587$ AUC, compared with $0.6443\pm 0.0223$ AUCachieved by traditional approaches such as PCA.

Boosted Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Regression

  We propose a sparse and low-rank tensor regression model to relate aunivariate outcome to a feature tensor, in which each unit-rank tensor from theCP decomposition of the coefficient tensor is assumed to be sparse. Thisstructure is both parsimonious and highly interpretable, as it implies that theoutcome is related to the features through a few distinct pathways, each ofwhich may only involve subsets of feature dimensions. We take adivide-and-conquer strategy to simplify the task into a set of sparse unit-ranktensor regression problems. To make the computation efficient and scalable, forthe unit-rank tensor regression, we propose a stagewise estimation procedure toefficiently trace out its entire solution path. We show that as the step sizegoes to zero, the stagewise solution paths converge exactly to those of thecorresponding regularized regression. The superior performance of our approachis demonstrated on various real-world and synthetic examples.

Asynchronous Multi-Task Learning

  Many real-world machine learning applications involve several learning taskswhich are inter-related. For example, in healthcare domain, we need to learn apredictive model of a certain disease for many hospitals. The models for eachhospital may be different because of the inherent differences in thedistributions of the patient populations. However, the models are also closelyrelated because of the nature of the learning tasks modeling the same disease.By simultaneously learning all the tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) paradigmperforms inductive knowledge transfer among tasks to improve the generalizationperformance. When datasets for the learning tasks are stored at differentlocations, it may not always be feasible to transfer the data to provide adata-centralized computing environment due to various practical issues such ashigh data volume and privacy. In this paper, we propose a principled MTLframework for distributed and asynchronous optimization to address theaforementioned challenges. In our framework, gradient update does not wait forcollecting the gradient information from all the tasks. Therefore, the proposedmethod is very efficient when the communication delay is too high for some tasknodes. We show that many regularized MTL formulations can benefit from thisframework, including the low-rank MTL for shared subspace learning. Empiricalstudies on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiencyand effectiveness of the proposed framework.

EdgeChain: Blockchain-based Multi-vendor Mobile Edge Application  Placement

  The state-of-the-art mobile edge applications are generating intense trafficand posing rigorous latency requirements to service providers. While resourcesharing across multiple service providers can be a way to maximize theutilization of limited resources at the network edge, it requires a centralizedrepository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status.Moreover, service providers have to trust each other for resource allocationfairness, which is difficult because of potential conflicts of interest. Wepropose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to make mobile edgeapplication placement decisions for multiple service providers. We firstformulate a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost formobile edge application placement scenarios. Based on our model, we present aheuristic mobile edge application placement algorithm. As a decentralizedpublic ledger, the blockchain then takes the logic of our algorithm as thesmart contract, with the consideration of resources from all mobile edge hostsparticipating in the system. The algorithm is agreed by all parties and theresults will only be accepted by majority of the mining nodes on theblockchain. When a placement decision is made, an edge host meeting theconsumer's latency and budget requirements will be selected at the lowest cost.All placement transactions are stored on the blockchain and are traceable byevery mobile edge service provider and application vendor who consumesresources at the mobile edge.

Identify Susceptible Locations in Medical Records via Adversarial  Attacks on Deep Predictive Models

  The surging availability of electronic medical records (EHR) leads toincreased research interests in medical predictive modeling. Recently many deeplearning based predicted models are also developed for EHR data anddemonstrated impressive performance. However, a series of recent studies showedthat these deep models are not safe: they suffer from certain vulnerabilities.In short, a well-trained deep network can be extremely sensitive to inputs withnegligible changes. These inputs are referred to as adversarial examples. Inthe context of medical informatics, such attacks could alter the result of ahigh performance deep predictive model by slightly perturbing a patient'smedical records. Such instability not only reflects the weakness of deeparchitectures, more importantly, it offers guide on detecting susceptible partson the inputs. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective frameworkthat learns a time-preferential minimum attack targeting the LSTM model withEHR inputs, and we leverage this attack strategy to screen medical records ofpatients and identify susceptible events and measurements. The efficientscreening procedure can assist decision makers to pay extra attentions to thelocations that can cause severe consequence if not measured correctly. Weconduct extensive empirical studies on a real-world urgent care cohort anddemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed screening approach.

Improving Mild Cognitive Impairment Prediction via Reinforcement  Learning and Dialogue Simulation

  Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal phase in the progression fromnormal aging to dementia, especially Alzheimers disease. Even though there ismild cognitive decline in MCI patients, they have normal overall cognition andthus is challenging to distinguish from normal aging. Using transcribed dataobtained from recorded conversational interactions between participants andtrained interviewers, and applying supervised learning models to these data, arecent clinical trial has shown a promising result in differentiating MCI fromnormal aging. However, the substantial amount of interactions with medicalstaff can still incur significant medical care expenses in practice. In thispaper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train anefficient dialogue agent on existing transcripts from clinical trials.Specifically, the agent is trained to sketch disease-specific lexicalprobability distribution, and thus to converse in a way that maximizes thediagnosis accuracy and minimizes the number of conversation turns. We evaluatethe performance of the proposed reinforcement learning framework on the MCIdiagnosis from a real clinical trial. The results show that while using only afew turns of conversation, our framework can significantly outperformstate-of-the-art supervised learning approaches.

Subspace Network: Deep Multi-Task Censored Regression for Modeling  Neurodegenerative Diseases

  Over the past decade a wide spectrum of machine learning models have beendeveloped to model the neurodegenerative diseases, associating biomarkers,especially non-intrusive neuroimaging markers, with key clinical scoresmeasuring the cognitive status of patients. Multi-task learning (MTL) has beencommonly utilized by these studies to address high dimensionality and smallcohort size challenges. However, most existing MTL approaches are based onlinear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) they cannot explicitlyconsider upper/lower bounds in these clinical scores; 2) they lack thecapability to capture complicated non-linear interactions among the variables.In this paper, we propose Subspace Network, an efficient deep modeling approachfor non-linear multi-task censored regression. Each layer of the subspacenetwork performs a multi-task censored regression to improve upon thepredictions from the last layer via sketching a low-dimensional subspace toperform knowledge transfer among learning tasks. Under mild assumptions, foreach layer the parametric subspace can be recovered using only one pass oftraining data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed subspace networkquickly picks up the correct parameter subspaces, and outperformsstate-of-the-arts in predicting neurodegenerative clinical scores usinginformation in brain imaging.

Model-Protected Multi-Task Learning

  Multi-task learning (MTL) refers to the paradigm of learning multiple relatedtasks together. By contrast, single-task learning (STL) learns each individualtask independently. MTL often leads to better trained models because they canleverage the commonalities among related tasks. However, because MTL algorithmswill "transmit" information on different models across different tasks, MTLposes a potential security risk. Specifically, an adversary may participate inthe MTL process through a participating task, thereby acquiring the modelinformation for another task. Previously proposed privacy-preserving MTLmethods protect data instances rather than models, and some of them mayunderperform in comparison with STL methods. In this paper, we propose aprivacy-preserving MTL framework to prevent the information on each model fromleaking to other models based on a perturbation of the covariance matrix of themodel matrix, and we study two popular MTL approaches for instantiation,namely, MTL approaches for learning the low-rank and group-sparse patterns ofthe model matrix. Our methods are built upon tools for differential privacy.Privacy guarantees and utility bounds are provided. Heterogeneous privacybudgets are considered. Our algorithms can be guaranteed not to underperformcomparing with STL methods. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithmsoutperform existing privacy-preserving MTL methods on the proposedmodel-protection problem.

Study of electron emission from 1D nanomaterials under super high field

  Photoemission driven by a strong electric field of near-infrared or visiblelight, referred to as strong-field photoemission, produces attosecond electronpulses that are synchronized to the waveform of the incident light, and thisprinciple lies at the heart of current attosecond technologies. However, fullaccess to strong-field photoemission regimes at near-infrared wavelengths basedon solid-state materials is restricted by space-charge screening and materialdamage at high optical-field strengths, which significantly hampers therealization of predicted attosecond technologies, such as ultra-sensitiveoptical phase modulation. Here, we demonstrate a new type of strong-fieldphotoemission behaviour with extreme nonlinearity -- photoemission currentscales follow a 40th power law of the optical-field strength, making use ofsub-nanometric carbon nanotubes and 800 nm pulses. As a result, the totalphotoemission current depends on the carrier-envelope phase with a greatlyimproved photoemission current modulation depth of up to 100%, which has notpreviously been achieved. Time-dependent density functional calculations revealthe completely new behaviour of the optical-field induced tunnelling emissionprocess directly from the valence band of the carbon nanotubes, which is anindication of full access to a strong-field photoemission regime. Furthermore,the nonlinear dynamics are observed to be tunable by changing the bindingenergy of the valence-band-maximum, as confirmed by Simpleman modelcalculations. We believe that such extreme nonlinear photoemission fromnanotips offers a new means of producing extreme temporal-spatial resolvedelectron pulses. These results additionally provide a new design philosophy forattosecond electronics and optics by making use of tunable band structures innanomaterials.
