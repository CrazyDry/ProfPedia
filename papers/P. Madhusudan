Horn-ICE Learning for Synthesizing Invariants and Contracts

  We design learning algorithms for synthesizing invariants using Hornimplication counterexamples (Horn-ICE), extending the ICE-learning model. Inparticular, we describe a decision-tree learning algorithm that learns fromHorn-ICE samples, works in polynomial time, and uses statistical heuristics tolearn small trees that satisfy the samples. Since most verification proofs canbe modeled using Horn clauses, Horn-ICE learning is a more robust technique tolearn inductive annotations that prove programs correct. Our experiments showthat an implementation of our algorithm is able to learn adequate inductiveinvariants and contracts efficiently for a variety of sequential and concurrentprograms.

Quantified Data Automata on Skinny Trees: an Abstract Domain for Lists

  We propose a new approach to heap analysis through an abstract domain ofautomata, called automatic shapes. The abstract domain uses a particular kindof automata, called quantified data automata on skinny trees (QSDAs), thatallows to define universally quantified properties of singly-linked lists. Toensure convergence of the abstract fixed-point computation, we introduce asub-class of QSDAs called elastic QSDAs, which also form an abstract domain. Weevaluate our approach on several list manipulating programs and we show thatthe proposed domain is powerful enough to prove a large class of these programscorrect.

Coronal turbulence and the angular broadening of radio sources - the  role of the structure function

  The amplitude of density turbulence in the extended solar corona, especiallynear the dissipation scale, impinges on several problems of current interest.Radio sources observed through the turbulent solar wind are broadened due torefraction by and scattering off density inhomogeneities, and observations ofscatter broadening are often employed to constrain the turbulence amplitude.The extent of such scatter broadening is usually computed using the structurefunction, which gives a measure of the spatial correlation measured by aninterferometer. Most such treatments have employed analytical approximations tothe structure function that are valid in the asymptotic limits $s \gg l_{i}$ or$s \ll l_{i}$, where $s$ is the interferometer spacing and $l_{i}$ is the innerscale of the density turbulence spectrum. We instead use a general structurefunction (GSF) that straddles these regimes, and quantify the errors introducedby the use of these approximations. We have included the effects of anisotropicscattering for distant cosmic sources viewed through the solar wind at smallelongations. We show that the regimes where the GSF predictions are moreaccurate than those of the asymptotic expressions are not only of practicalrelevance, but are where inner scale effects influence estimates of scatterbroadening. Taken together, we argue that the GSF should henceforth be used forscatter broadening calculations and estimates of turbulence amplitudes in thesolar corona and solar wind.

The response of the terrestrial bow shock and magnetopause of the long  term decline in solar polar fields

  The location of the terrestrial magnetopause (MP) and it's subsolar stand-offdistance depends not only on the solar wind dynamic pressure and theinterplanetary magnetic field (IMF), both of which play a crucial role indetermining it's shape, but also on the nature of the processes involved in theinteraction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. The stand-offdistance of the earth's MP and bow shock (BS) also define the extent ofterrestrial magnetic fields into near-earth space on the sunward side and haveimportant consequences for space weather. However, asymmetries due to thedirection of the IMF are hard to account for, making it nearly impossible tofavour any specific model over the other in estimating the extent of the MP orBS. Thus, both numerical and empirical models have been used and compared toestimate the BS and MP stand-off distances as well as the MP shape, in theperiod Jan. 1975-Dec. 2016, covering solar cycles 21-24. The computed MP and BSstand-off distances have been found to be increasing steadily over the past twodecades, since ~1995, spanning solar cycles 23 and 24. The increasing trend isconsistent with earlier reported studies of a long term and steady decline insolar polar magnetic fields and solar wind micro-turbulence levels. The presentstudy, thus, highlights the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere to thelong term global changes in both solar and solar wind activity, through adetailed study of the extent and shape of the terrestrial MP and BS over thepast four solar cycles, a period spanning the last four decades.

Amplitude of solar wind density turbulence from 10--45 $R_{\odot}$

  We report on the amplitude of the density turbulence spectrum ($C_{N}^{2}$)and the density modulation index ($\delta N/N$) in the solar wind between $10$and $45 R_{\odot}$. We derive these quantities using a structure function thatis observationally constrained by occultation observations of the Crab nebulamade in 2011 and 2013 and similar observations published earlier. We use themost general form of the structure function, together with currently usedprescriptions for the inner/dissipation scale of the turbulence spectrum. Ourwork yields a comprehensive picture of a) the manner in which $C_{N}^{2}$ and$\delta N/N$ vary with heliocentric distance in the solar wind and b) of thesolar cycle dependence of these quantities.

Learning Universally Quantified Invariants of Linear Data Structures

  We propose a new automaton model, called quantified data automata over words,that can model quantified invariants over linear data structures, and buildpoly-time active learning algorithms for them, where the learner is allowed toquery the teacher with membership and equivalence queries. In order to expressinvariants in decidable logics, we invent a decidable subclass of QDAs, calledelastic QDAs, and prove that every QDA has a uniqueminimally-over-approximating elastic QDA. We then give an application of thesetheoretically sound and efficient active learning algorithms in a passivelearning framework and show that we can efficiently learn quantified lineardata structure invariants from samples obtained from dynamic runs for a largeclass of programs.

Sequentializing Parameterized Programs

  We exhibit assertion-preserving (reachability preserving) transformationsfrom parameterized concurrent shared-memory programs, under a k-roundscheduling of processes, to sequential programs. The salient feature of thesequential program is that it tracks the local variables of only one thread atany point, and uses only O(k) copies of shared variables (it does not use extracounters, not even one counter to keep track of the number of threads).Sequentialization is achieved using the concept of a linear interface thatcaptures the effect an unbounded block of processes have on the shared state ina k-round schedule. Our transformation utilizes linear interfaces tosequentialize the program, and to ensure the sequential program explores onlyreachable states and preserves local invariants.

Positron Annihilation Study of Biopolymer Inulin for Understanding its  Structural Organization

  Inulins are nano-meter size semi-crystalline particles, composed ofoligomeric fructose units. It has been subjected to fine micro-structuralanalysis under temperature variations using mainly positron annihilationspectroscopy. The results show a non-monotonous temperature sensitive behaviourof the positron parameters, with considerable variation of its free volumesize. The ortho-positronium pick-off component shows a major thermotropictransition at ~320K and a structure loss due to glass transition. Differentialscanning calorimetry confirms the onset of the major molecular transitionaround the same temperature with an enthalpy change of {\Delta}H ~379J /gm andthermo-gravimetric analysis shows mass loss in the said transition. Keywords:Inulin, fructose units, positron annihilation spectroscopy, microstructure,free volume analysis. thermotropic transition, thermal analysis.

Abstract Learning Frameworks for Synthesis

  We develop abstract learning frameworks (ALFs) for synthesis that embody theprinciples of CEGIS (counter-example based inductive synthesis) strategies thathave become widely applicable in recent years. Our framework defines a generalabstract framework of iterative learning, based on a hypothesis space thatcaptures the synthesized objects, a sample space that forms the space on whichinduction is performed, and a concept space that abstractly defines thesemantics of the learning process. We show that a variety of synthesisalgorithms in current literature can be embedded in this general framework.While studying these embeddings, we also generalize some of the synthesisproblems these instances are of, resulting in new ways of looking at synthesisproblems using learning. We also investigate convergence issues for the generalframework, and exhibit three recipes for convergence in finite time. The firsttwo recipes generalize current techniques for convergence used by existingsynthesis engines. The third technique is a more involved technique of which weknow of no existing instantiation, and we instantiate it to concrete synthesisproblems.

A Decidable Fragment of Second Order Logic With Applications to  Synthesis

  We propose a fragment of many-sorted second order logic called EQSMT and showthat checking satisfiability of sentences in this fragment is decidable. EQSMTformulae have an $\exists^*\forall^*$ quantifier prefix (over variables,functions and relations) making EQSMT conducive for modeling synthesisproblems. Moreover, EQSMT allows reasoning using a combination of backgroundtheories provided that they have a decidable satisfiability problem for the$\exists^*\forall^*$ FO-fragment (e.g., linear arithmetic). Our decisionprocedure reduces the satisfiability of EQSMT formulae to satisfiabilityqueries of $\exists^*\forall^*$ formulae of each individual background theory,allowing us to use existing efficient SMT solvers supporting$\exists^*\forall^*$ reasoning for these theories; hence our procedure can beseen as effectively quantified SMT (EQSMT) reasoning.  Errata: We have modified the transformation step-2 (page 9) to correct for aslight error. Also, the description above Theorem 10 is different from thepublished version.

Invariant Synthesis for Incomplete Verification Engines

  We propose a framework for synthesizing inductive invariants for incompleteverification engines, which soundly reduce logical problems in undecidabletheories to decidable theories. Our framework is based on the counter-exampleguided inductive synthesis principle (CEGIS) and allows verification engines tocommunicate non-provability information to guide invariant synthesis. We showprecisely how the verification engine can compute such non-provabilityinformation and how to build effective learning algorithms when invariants areexpressed as Boolean combinations of a fixed set of predicates. Moreover, weevaluate our framework in two verification settings, one in which verificationengines need to handle quantified formulas and one in which verificationengines have to reason about heap properties expressed in an expressive butundecidable separation logic. Our experiments show that our invariant synthesisframework based on non-provability information can both effectively synthesizeinductive invariants and adequately strengthen contracts across a large suiteof programs.

Inferring Formal Properties of Production Key-Value Stores

  Production distributed systems are challenging to formally verify, inparticular when they are based on distributed protocols that are not rigorouslydescribed or fully understood. In this paper, we derive models and propertiesfor two core distributed protocols used in eventually consistent productionkey-value stores such as Riak and Cassandra. We propose a novel modeling calledcertified program models, where complete distributed systems are captured asprograms written in traditional systems languages such as concurrent C.Specifically, we model the read-repair and hinted-handoff recovery protocols asconcurrent C programs, test them for conformance with real systems, and thenverify that they guarantee eventual consistency, modeling precisely thespecification as well as the failure assumptions under which the results hold.

Decidable Verification of Uninterpreted Programs

  We study the problem of completely automatically verifying uninterpretedprograms---programs that work over arbitrary data models that provide aninterpretation for the constants, functions and relations the program uses. Theverification problem asks whether a given program satisfies a postconditionwritten using quantifier-free formulas with equality on the final state, withno loop invariants, contracts, etc. being provided. We show that this problemis undecidable in general. The main contribution of this paper is a subclass ofprograms, called coherent programs that admits decidable verification, and canbe decided in PSPACE. We then extend this class of programs to classes ofprograms that are $k$-coherent, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$, obtained by(automatically) adding $k$ ghost variables and assignments that make themcoherent. We also extend the decidability result to programs with recursivefunction calls and prove several undecidability results that show why ourrestrictions to obtain decidability seem necessary.

A First Order Logic with Frames

  We propose a novel logic, called Frame Logic (FL), that extends first-orderlogic (with recursive definitions) using a construct $Fr(\cdot)$ that capturesthe implicit frames of formulas--- the precise subset of the universe uponwhich their meaning depends. Using such frames, we formulate proof rules thatfacilitate frame reasoning elegantly when the underlying model undergoeschange. We show that the logic is expressive by expressing several propertiesof data-structures and also exhibit a translation from a separation logic thatdefines precise formulas to frame logic. Finally, we design a program logicbased on frame logic for reasoning with programs that dynamically update heapsthat facilitates local specifications and frame reasoning. We present bothlocalized proof rules as well as rules that can derive the weakest tightestpreconditions in FL. We show that verification conditions for recursion-freeprogram blocks can be derived also in pure first-order logic with recursivedefinitions with an appropriate frame rule, facilitating frame reasoning.

Reachability under Contextual Locking

  The pairwise reachability problem for a multi-threaded program asks, givencontrol locations in two threads, whether they can be simultaneously reached inan execution of the program. The problem is important for static analysis andis used to detect statements that are concurrently enabled. This problem is ingeneral undecidable even when data is abstracted and when the threads (withrecursion) synchronize only using a finite set of locks. Popular programmingparadigms that limit the lock usage patterns have been identified under whichthe pairwise reachability problem becomes decidable. In this paper, we considera new natural programming paradigm, called contextual locking, which ties thelock usage to calling patterns in each thread: we assume that locks arereleased in the same context that they were acquired and that every lockacquired by a thread in a procedure call is released before the procedurereturns. Our main result is that the pairwise reachability problem ispolynomial-time decidable for this new programming paradigm as well. Theproblem becomes undecidable if the locks are reentrant; reentrant locking is a\emph{recursive locking} mechanism which allows a thread in a multi-threadedprogram to acquire the reentrant lock multiple times.
