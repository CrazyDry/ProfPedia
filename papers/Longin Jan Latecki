Spherical coverage verification

  We consider the problem of covering hypersphere by a set of sphericalhypercaps. This sort of problem has numerous practical applications such aserror correcting codes and reverse k-nearest neighbor problem. Using thereduction of non degenerated concave quadratic programming (QP) problem, wedemonstrate that spherical coverage verification is NP hard. We propose arecursive algorithm based on reducing the problem to several lower dimensionsubproblems. We test the performance of the proposed algorithm on a number ofgenerated constellations. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, in spiteof its exponential worst-case complexity, is applicable in practice. Incontrast, our results indicate that spherical coverage verification using QPsolvers that utilize heuristics, due to numerical instability, may producefalse positives.

Multidimensional Scaling on Multiple Input Distance Matrices

  Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a classic technique that seeks vectorialrepresentations for data points, given the pairwise distances between them.However, in recent years, data are usually collected from diverse sources orhave multiple heterogeneous representations. How to do multidimensional scalingon multiple input distance matrices is still unsolved to our best knowledge. Inthis paper, we first define this new task formally. Then, we propose a newalgorithm called Multi-View Multidimensional Scaling (MVMDS) by consideringeach input distance matrix as one view. Our algorithm is able to learn theweights of views (i.e., distance matrices) automatically by exploring theconsensus information and complementary nature of views. Experimental resultson synthetic as well as real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MVMDS.We hope that our work encourages a wider consideration in many domains whereMDS is needed.

Advancing Tabu and Restart in Local Search for Maximum Weight Cliques

  The tabu and restart are two fundamental strategies for local search. In thispaper, we improve the local search algorithms for solving the Maximum WeightClique (MWC) problem by introducing new tabu and restart strategies. Both thetabu and restart strategies proposed are based on the notion of a local searchscenario, which involves not only a candidate solution but also the tabu statusand unlocking relationship. Compared to the strategy of configuration checking,our tabu mechanism discourages forming a cycle of unlocking operations. Our newrestart strategy is based on the re-occurrence of a local search scenarioinstead of that of a candidate solution. Experimental results show that theresulting MWC solver outperforms several state-of-the-art solvers on theDIMACS, BHOSLIB, and two benchmarks from practical applications.

Scene Parsing via Dense Recurrent Neural Networks with Attentional  Selection

  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown the ability to improve sceneparsing through capturing long-range dependencies among image units. In thispaper, we propose dense RNNs for scene labeling by exploring various long-rangesemantic dependencies among image units. Different from existing RNN basedapproaches, our dense RNNs are able to capture richer contextual dependenciesfor each image unit by enabling immediate connections between each pair ofimage units, which significantly enhances their discriminative power. Besides,to select relevant dependencies and meanwhile to restrain irrelevant ones foreach unit from dense connections, we introduce an attention model into denseRNNs. The attention model allows automatically assigning more importance tohelpful dependencies while less weight to unconcerned dependencies. Integratingwith convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we develop an end-to-end scenelabeling system. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmarksdemonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the baselines by largemargins and outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms.

Revealing Cluster Structure of Graph by Path Following Replicator  Dynamic

  In this paper, we propose a path following replicator dynamic, andinvestigate its potentials in uncovering the underlying cluster structure of agraph. The proposed dynamic is a generalization of the discrete replicatordynamic. The replicator dynamic has been successfully used to extract denseclusters of graphs; however, it is often sensitive to the degree distributionof a graph, and usually biased by vertices with large degrees, thus may fail todetect the densest cluster. To overcome this problem, we introduce a dynamicparameter, called path parameter, into the evolution process. The pathparameter can be interpreted as the maximal possible probability of a currentcluster containing a vertex, and it monotonically increases as evolutionprocess proceeds. By limiting the maximal probability, the phenomenon of somevertices dominating the early stage of evolution process is suppressed, thusmaking evolution process more robust. To solve the optimization problem with afixed path parameter, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm. The timecomplexity of the path following replicator dynamic is only linear in thenumber of edges of a graph, thus it can analyze graphs with millions ofvertices and tens of millions of edges on a common PC in a few minutes.Besides, it can be naturally generalized to hypergraph and graph with edges ofdifferent orders. We apply it to four important problems: maximum cliqueproblem, densest k-subgraph problem, structure fitting, and discovery ofhigh-density regions. The extensive experimental results clearly demonstrateits advantages, in terms of robustness, scalability and flexility.

GIFT: A Real-time and Scalable 3D Shape Search Engine

  Projective analysis is an important solution for 3D shape retrieval, sincehuman visual perceptions of 3D shapes rely on various 2D observations fromdifferent view points. Although multiple informative and discriminative viewsare utilized, most projection-based retrieval systems suffer from heavycomputational cost, thus cannot satisfy the basic requirement of scalabilityfor search engines. In this paper, we present a real-time 3D shape searchengine based on the projective images of 3D shapes. The real-time property ofour search engine results from the following aspects: (1) efficient projectionand view feature extraction using GPU acceleration; (2) the first invertedfile, referred as F-IF, is utilized to speed up the procedure of multi-viewmatching; (3) the second inverted file (S-IF), which captures a localdistribution of 3D shapes in the feature manifold, is adopted for efficientcontext-based re-ranking. As a result, for each query the retrieval task can befinished within one second despite the necessary cost of IO overhead. We namethe proposed 3D shape search engine, which combines GPU acceleration andInverted File Twice, as GIFT. Besides its high efficiency, GIFT alsooutperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in retrieval accuracy onvarious shape benchmarks and competitions.
