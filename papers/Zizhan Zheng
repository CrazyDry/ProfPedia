Ensuring Predictable Contact Opportunity for Scalable Vehicular Internet  Access On the Go

  With increasing popularity of media enabled hand-helds and their integrationwith the in-vehicle entertainment systems, the need for high data-rate servicesfor mobile users on the go is evident. This ever-increasing demand of data isconstantly surpassing what cellular networks can economically support.Large-scale Wireless LANs (WLANs) can provide such a service, but they areexpensive to deploy and maintain. Open WLAN access-points, on the other hand,need no new deployments, but can offer only opportunistic services, lacking anyperformance guarantees. In contrast, a carefully planned sparse deployment ofroadside WiFi provides an economically scalable infrastructure with quality ofservice assurance to mobile users. In this paper, we present a new metric,called Contact Opportunity, to closely model the quality of data service that amobile user might experience when driving through the system. We then presentefficient deployment algorithms for minimizing the cost for ensuring a requiredlevel of contact opportunity. We further extend this concept and the deploymenttechniques to a more intuitive metric -- the average throughput -- by takingvarious dynamic elements into account. Simulations over a real road network andexperimental results show that our approach achieves significantly better costvs. throughput tradeoff in both the worst case and average case compared withsome commonly used deployment algorithms.

The Impact of Stealthy Attacks on Smart Grid Performance: Tradeoffs and  Implications

  The smart grid is envisioned to significantly enhance the efficiency ofenergy consumption, by utilizing two-way communication channels betweenconsumers and operators. For example, operators can opportunistically leveragethe delay tolerance of energy demands in order to balance the energy load overtime, and hence, reduce the total operational cost. This opportunity, however,comes with security threats, as the grid becomes more vulnerable tocyber-attacks. In this paper, we study the impact of such maliciouscyber-attacks on the energy efficiency of the grid in a simplified setup. Moreprecisely, we consider a simple model where the energy demands of the smartgrid consumers are intercepted and altered by an active attacker before theyarrive at the operator, who is equipped with limited intrusion detectioncapabilities. We formulate the resulting optimization problems faced by theoperator and the attacker and propose several scheduling and attack strategiesfor both parties. Interestingly, our results show that, as opposed tofacilitating cost reduction in the smart grid, increasing the delay toleranceof the energy demands potentially allows the attacker to force increased costson the system. This highlights the need for carefully constructed and robustintrusion detection mechanisms at the operator.

When to Reset Your Keys: Optimal Timing of Security Updates via Learning

  Cybersecurity is increasingly threatened by advanced and persistent attacks.As these attacks are often designed to disable a system (or a criticalresource, e.g., a user account) repeatedly, it is crucial for the defender tokeep updating its security measures to strike a balance between the risk ofbeing compromised and the cost of security updates. Moreover, these decisionsoften need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthynature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimaltiming policy under incomplete information has broad applications incybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application ofpatches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimaltiming are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-definedattack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case inpractice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimaltiming of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We considera variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback andunknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutivesecurity updates. The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associativebandit problem with dependent arms. We derive upper confidence bound basedlearning policies that achieve low regret compared with optimal periodicdefense strategies that can only be derived when attack time distributions areknown.

Maximizing System Throughput by Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio  Networks

  Cognitive Radio Networks allow unlicensed users to opportunistically accessthe licensed spectrum without causing disruptive interference to the primaryusers (PUs). One of the main challenges in CRNs is the ability to detect PUtransmissions. Recent works have suggested the use of secondary user (SU)cooperation over individual sensing to improve sensing accuracy. In this paper,we consider a CRN consisting of a single PU and multiple SUs to study theproblem of maximizing the total expected system throughput. We propose aBayesian decision rule based algorithm to solve the problem optimally with aconstant time complexity. To prioritize PU transmissions, we re-formulate thethroughput maximization problem by adding a constraint on the PU throughput.The constrained optimization problem is shown to be NP-hard and solved via agreedy algorithm with pseudo-polynomial time complexity that achieves strictlygreater than 1/2 of the optimal solution. We also investigate the case forwhich a constraint is put on the sensing time overhead, which limits the numberof SUs that can participate in cooperative sensing. We reveal that the systemthroughput is monotonic over the number of SUs chosen for sensing. Weillustrate the efficacy of the performance of our algorithms via a numericalinvestigation.

Maximizing System Throughput Using Cooperative Sensing in Multi-Channel  Cognitive Radio Networks

  In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), unlicensed users are allowed to accessthe licensed spectrum when it is not currently being used by primary users(PUs). In this paper, we study the throughput maximization problem for amulti-channel CRN where each SU can only sense a limited number of channels. Weshow that this problem is strongly NP-hard, and propose an approximationalgorithm with a factor at least $1/2\mu$ where $\mu \in [1,2]$ is a systemparameter reflecting the sensing capability of SUs across channels and theirsensing budgets. This performance guarantee is achieved by exploiting a nicestructural property of the objective function and constructing a particularmatching. Our numerical results demonstrate the advantage of our algorithmcompared with both a random and a greedy sensing assignment algorithm.

Trust Exploitation and Attention Competition: A Game Theoretical Model

  The proliferation of Social Network Sites (SNSs) has greatly reformed the wayof information dissemination, but also provided a new venue for hosts withimpure motivations to disseminate malicious information. Social trust is thebasis for information dissemination in SNSs. Malicious hosts judiciously anddynamically make the balance between maintaining its social trust and selfishlymaximizing its malicious gain over a long time-span. Studying the optimalresponse strategies for each malicious host could assist to design the bestsystem maneuver so as to achieve the targeted level of overall maliciousactivities. In this paper, we propose an interaction-based social trust model,and formulate the maximization of long-term malicious gains of multiplecompeting hosts as a non-cooperative differential game. Through rigorousanalysis, optimal response strategies are identified and the best systemmaneuver mechanism is presented. Extensive numerical studies further verify theanalytical results.

FlowIntent: Detecting Privacy Leakage from User Intention to Network  Traffic Mapping

  The exponential growth of mobile devices has raised concerns about sensitivedata leakage. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify suspiciouslocation-related HTTP transmission flows from the user's perspective, byanswering the question: Is the transmission user-intended? In contrast toprevious network-level detection schemes that mainly rely on a given set ofsuspicious hostnames, our approach can better adapt to the fast growth of appmarket and the constantly evolving leakage patterns. On the other hand,compared to existing system-level detection schemes built upon program taintanalysis, where all sensitive transmissions as treated as illegal, our approachbetter meets the user needs and is easier to deploy. In particular, ourproof-of-concept implementation (FlowIntent) captures sensitive transmissionsmissed by TaintDroid, the state-of-the-art dynamic taint analysis system onAndroid platforms. Evaluation using 1002 location sharing instances collectedfrom more than 20,000 apps shows that our approach achieves about 91% accuracyin detecting illegitimate location transmissions.

LeakSemantic: Identifying Abnormal Sensitive Network Transmissions in  Mobile Applications

  Mobile applications (apps) often transmit sensitive data through network withvarious intentions. Some transmissions are needed to fulfill the app'sfunctionalities. However, transmissions with malicious receivers may lead toprivacy leakage and tend to behave stealthily to evade detection. The problemis twofold: how does one unveil sensitive transmissions in mobile apps, andgiven a sensitive transmission, how does one determine if it is legitimate?  In this paper, we propose LeakSemantic, a framework that can automaticallylocate abnormal sensitive network transmissions from mobile apps. LeakSemanticconsists of a hybrid program analysis component and a machine learningcomponent. Our program analysis component combines static analysis and dynamicanalysis to precisely identify sensitive transmissions. Compared to existingtaint analysis approaches, LeakSemantic achieves better accuracy with fewerfalse positives and is able to collect runtime data such as network traffic foreach transmission. Based on features derived from the runtime data, machinelearning classifiers are built to further differentiate between the legal andillegal disclosures. Experiments show that LeakSemantic achieves 91% accuracyon 2279 sensitive connections from 1404 apps.

Keeping Context In Mind: Automating Mobile App Access Control with User  Interface Inspection

  Recent studies observe that app foreground is the most striking componentthat influences the access control decisions in mobile platform, as users tendto deny permission requests lacking visible evidence. However, none of theexisting permission models provides a systematic approach that canautomatically answer the question: Is the resource access indicated by appforeground? In this work, we present the design, implementation, and evaluationof COSMOS, a context-aware mediation system that bridges the semantic gapbetween foreground interaction and background access, in order to protectsystem integrity and user privacy. Specifically, COSMOS learns from a large setof apps with similar functionalities and user interfaces to construct genericmodels that detect the outliers at runtime. It can be further customized tosatisfy specific user privacy preference by continuously evolving with userdecisions. Experiments show that COSMOS achieves both high precision and highrecall in detecting malicious requests. We also demonstrate the effectivenessof COSMOS in capturing specific user preferences using the decisions collectedfrom 24 users and illustrate that COSMOS can be easily deployed on smartphonesas a real-time guard with a very low performance overhead.

An Online Algorithm for Power-proportional Data Centers with Switching  Cost

  Recent studies have shown that power-proportional data centers can saveenergy cost by dynamically "right-sizing" the data centers based on real-timeworkload. More servers are activated when the workload increases while someservers can be put into the sleep mode during periods of low load. In thispaper, we revisit the dynamic right-sizing problem for heterogeneous datacenters with various operational cost and switching cost. We propose a newonline algorithm based on a regularization technique, which achieves a bettercompetitive ratio compared to the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm. We furtherintroduce a switching cost offset into the model and extend our algorithm tothis new setting. Simulations based on real workload and renewable energytraces show that our algorithms outperform the greedy algorithm in bothsettings.

Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Graphical Bandits Without the Graphs

  We study multi-armed bandit problems with graph feedback, in which thedecision maker is allowed to observe the neighboring actions of the chosenaction, in a setting where the graph may vary over time and is never fullyrevealed to the decision maker. We show that when the feedback graphs areundirected, the original Thompson Sampling achieves the optimal (withinlogarithmic factors) regret $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\beta_0(G)T}\right)$ overtime horizon $T$, where $\beta_0(G)$ is the average independence number of thelatent graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showingthat the original Thompson Sampling is optimal for graphical bandits in theundirected setting. A slightly weaker regret bound of Thompson Sampling in thedirected setting is also presented. To fill this gap, we propose a variant ofThompson Sampling, that attains the optimal regret in the directed settingwithin a logarithmic factor. Both algorithms can be implemented efficiently anddo not require the knowledge of the feedback graphs at any time.

Maximizing Social Welfare in Operator-based Cognitive Radio Networks  under Spectrum Uncertainty and Sensing Inaccuracy

  In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), secondary users (SUs) are allowed toopportunistically access the unused/under-utilized channels of primary users(PUs). To utilize spectrum resources efficiently, an auction scheme is oftenapplied where an operator serves as an auctioneer and accepts spectrum requestsfrom SUs. Most existing works on spectrum auctions assume that the operator hasperfect knowledge of PU activities. In practice, however, it is more likelythat the operator only has statistical information of the PU traffic when it istrading a spectrum hole, and it is acquiring more accurate information in realtime. In this paper, we distinguish PU channels that are under the control ofthe operator, where accurate channel states are revealed in real-time, andchannels that the operator acquires from PUs out of its control, where asense-before-use paradigm has to be followed. Considering both spectrumuncertainty and sensing inaccuracy, we study the social welfare maximizationproblem for serving SUs with various levels of delay tolerance. We first modelthe problem as a finite horizon Markov decision process when the operator knowsall spectrum requests in advance, and propose an optimal dynamic programmingbased algorithm. We then investigate the case when spectrum requests aresubmitted online, and propose a greedy algorithm that is 1/2-competitive forhomogeneous channels and is comparable to the offline algorithm for moregeneral settings. We further show that the online algorithm together with apayment scheme achieves incentive compatibility for the SUs while guaranteeinga non-negative revenue for the operator.

Provably Delay Efficient Data Retrieving in Storage Clouds

  One key requirement for storage clouds is to be able to retrieve dataquickly. Recent system measurements have shown that the data retrieving delayin storage clouds is highly variable, which may result in a long latency tail.One crucial idea to improve the delay performance is to retrieve multiple datacopies by using parallel downloading threads. However, how to optimallyschedule these downloading threads to minimize the data retrieving delayremains to be an important open problem. In this paper, we developlow-complexity thread scheduling policies for several important classes of datadownloading time distributions, and prove that these policies are eitherdelay-optimal or within a constant gap from the optimum delay performance.These theoretical results hold for an arbitrary arrival process of readrequests that may contain finite or infinite read requests, and forheterogeneous MDS storage codes that can support diverse storage redundancy andreliability requirements for different data files. Our numerical results showthat the delay performance of the proposed policies is significantly betterthan that of First-Come- First-Served (FCFS) policies considered in prior work.

Defending Against Stealthy Attacks on Multiple Nodes with Limited  Resources: A Game-Theoretic Analysis

  Stealthy attacks are a major cyber-security threat. In practice, bothattackers and defenders have resource constraints that could limit theircapabilities. Hence, to develop robust defense strategies, a promising approachis to utilize game theory to understand the fundamental trade-offs involved.Previous works in this direction, however, mainly focus on the single-node casewithout considering strict resource constraints. In this paper, agame-theoretic model for protecting a system of multiple nodes against stealthyattacks is proposed. We consider the practical setting where the frequencies ofboth attack and defense are constrained by limited resources, and an asymmetricfeedback structure where the attacker can fully observe the states of nodeswhile largely hiding its actions from the defender. We characterize the bestresponse strategies for both attacker and defender in the space of bothnon-adaptive and adaptive strategies, and study the Nash Equilibria of thegame. We further study a sequential game where the defender first announces itsstrategy and the attacker then responds accordingly, and design an algorithmthat finds a nearly optimal strategy for the defender to commit to.

Structure-Preserving Transformation: Generating Diverse and Transferable  Adversarial Examples

  Adversarial examples are perturbed inputs designed to fool machine learningmodels. Most recent works on adversarial examples for image classificationfocus on directly modifying pixels with minor perturbations. A commonrequirement in all these works is that the malicious perturbations should besmall enough (measured by an L_p norm for some p) so that they areimperceptible to humans. However, small perturbations can be unnecessarilyrestrictive and limit the diversity of adversarial examples generated. Further,an L_p norm based distance metric ignores important structure patterns hiddenin images that are important to human perception. Consequently, even the minorperturbation introduced in recent works often makes the adversarial examplesless natural to humans. More importantly, they often do not transfer well andare therefore less effective when attacking black-box models especially forthose protected by a defense mechanism. In this paper, we propose astructure-preserving transformation (SPT) for generating natural and diverseadversarial examples with extremely high transferability. The key idea of ourapproach is to allow perceptible deviation in adversarial examples whilekeeping structure patterns that are central to a human classifier. Empiricalresults on the MNIST and the fashion-MNIST datasets show that adversarialexamples generated by our approach can easily bypass strong adversarialtraining. Further, they transfer well to other target models with no loss orlittle loss of successful attack rate.

Concurrent Channel Probing and Data Transmission in Full-duplex MIMO  Systems

  An essential step for achieving multiplexing gain in MIMO downlink systems isto collect accurate channel state information (CSI) from the users.Traditionally, CSIs have to be collected before any data can be transmitted.Such a sequential scheme incurs a large feedback overhead, which substantiallylimits the multiplexing gain especially in a network with a large number ofusers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate the feedbackoverhead by leveraging the recently developed Full-duplex radios. Our approachis based on the key observation that using Full-duplex radios, when thebase-station (BS) is collecting CSI of one user through the uplink channel, itcan use the downlink channel to simultaneously transmit data to other(non-interfering) users for which CSIs are already known. By allowingconcurrent channel probing and data transmission, our scheme can potentiallyachieve a higher throughput compared to traditional schemes using Half-duplexradios. The new flexibility introduced by our scheme, however, also leads tofundamental challenges in achieving throughout optimal scheduling. In thispaper, we make an initial effort to this important problem by considering asimplified group interference model. We develop a throughput optimal schedulingpolicy with complexity $O((N/I)^I)$, where $N$ is the number of users and $I$is the number of user groups. To further reduce the complexity, we propose agreedy policy with complexity $O(N\log N)$ that not only achieves at least 2/3of the optimal throughput region, but also outperforms any feasible Half-duplexsolutions. We derive the throughput gain offered by Full-duplex under differentsystem parameters and show the advantage of our algorithms through numericalstudies.
