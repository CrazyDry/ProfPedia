Tests show the detectionefficiency@25.3 meV thermal neutron is 34% for this nMCP detector.

The dual Minkowski problem for negative indices

  Recently, the duals of Federer's curvature measures, called dual curvaturemeasures, were discovered by Huang, Lutwak, Yang, and Zhang (ACTA, 2016). Inthe same paper, they posed the dual Minkowski problem, the characterizationproblem for dual curvature measures, and proved existence results when theindex, q, is in (0,n). The dual Minkowski problem includes the Aleksandrovproblem (q = 0) and the logarithmic Minkowski problem (q = n) as special cases.In the current work, a complete solution to the dual Minkowski problem wheneverq < 0, including both existence and uniqueness, is presented.

Broadband Quantum Efficiency Enhancement in High Index Nanowires  Resonators

  Light trapping in sub-wavelength semiconductor nanowires (NWs) offers apromising approach to simultaneously reducing material consumption andenhancing photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, the absorption efficiency ofa NW, defined by the ratio of optical absorption cross section to the NWdiameter, lingers around 1 in existing NW photonic devices, and the absorptionenhancement suffers from a narrow spectral width. Here, we show that theabsorption efficiency can be significantly improved in NWs with higherrefractive indices, by an experimental observation of up to 350% externalquantum efficiency (EQE) in lead sulfide (PbS) NW resonators, a 3-fold increasecompared to Si NWs. Furthermore, broadband absorption enhancement is achievedin single tapered NWs, where light of various wavelengths is absorbed atsegments with different diameters analogous to a tandem solar cell. Overall,the single NW Schottky junction solar cells benefit from optical resonance,near bandgap open circuit voltage, and long minority carrier diffusion length,demonstrating power conversion efficiency (PCE) comparable to single Si NWcoaxial p-n junction cells11, but with much simpler fabrication processes.

iDRM: Humanoid Motion Planning with Real-Time End-Pose Selection in  Complex Environments

  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse Dynamic Reachability Map (iDRM)that allows a floating base system to find valid end-poses in complex anddynamically changing environments in real-time. End-pose planning for validstance pose and collision-free configuration is an essential problem forhumanoid applications, such as providing goal states for walking and motionplanners. However, this is non-trivial in complex environments, where standinglocations and reaching postures are restricted by obstacles. Our proposed iDRMcustomizes the robot-to-workspace occupation list and uses an online updatealgorithm to enable efficient reconstruction of the reachability map toguarantee that the selected end-poses are always collision-free. The iDRM wasevaluated in a variety of reaching tasks using the 38 degree-of-freedom (DoF)humanoid robot Valkyrie. Our results show that the approach is capable offinding valid end-poses in a fraction of a second. Significantly, we alsodemonstrate that motion planning algorithms integrating our end-pose planningmethod are more efficient than those not utilizing this technique.

Scaling Sampling-based Motion Planning to Humanoid Robots

  Planning balanced and collision-free motion for humanoid robots isnon-trivial, especially when they are operated in complex environments, such asreaching targets behind obstacles or through narrow passages. We propose amethod that allows us to apply existing sampling--based algorithms to plantrajectories for humanoids by utilizing a customized state spacerepresentation, biased sampling strategies, and a steering function based on arobust inverse kinematics solver. Our approach requires no prior offlinecomputation, thus one can easily transfer the work to new robot platforms. Wetested the proposed method solving practical reaching tasks on a 38degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot, NASA Valkyrie, showing that our method isable to generate valid motion plans that can be executed on advanced full-sizehumanoid robots. We also present a benchmark between different motion planningalgorithms evaluated on a variety of reaching motion problems. This allows usto find suitable algorithms for solving humanoid motion planning problems, andto identify the limitations of these algorithms.

Engineering zero modes, Fano resonance and Tamm surface states of 'bound  states in the gapped continuum'

  In this article, we developed a generalized coupled-mode theory for mixing anisolated state with the gapped continuum to unify the engineering mechanism ofgap-protected zero modes, Fano resonance and Tamm surface states, even thoughthose phenomena are diverse in numerous branches of physics and optics. Bytuning the on-site potential and coupling strength of/with the isolated state,we found the operating characteristics from zero modes, Fano resonance and toTamm modes, with explicitly demonstrating their localization, transmissionspectra and distinct evolution dynamics of the 'bound states in the gappedcontinuum' (BIGC). As an extent, we designed two sandwich-like structures inthe BIGC framework: (1) the 'isolated-continuous-isolated' (ICI), which leadsto adiabatic elimination technique and topologically-protected edge states, and(2) the 'continuous-isolated-continuous' (CIC), which results into the domainwall dynamics. Finally, we proposed the optical waveguide array (WA) modellingof the modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger dimerized lattice to achieve thoseinteresting engineering processes, and meanwhile to shed light on thegeneralization of bound states in the continuum into photonics and condensedmatters.

Flexible Representation and Manipulation of Audio Signals on Quantum  Computers

  By analyzing the numerical representation of amplitude values in audiosignals and integrating the time component, a representation for audio signalson quantum computers, FRQA, is proposed. The FRQA representation is anormalized state that facilitates basic audio signal operations targeting theseparameters. The preparation and retrieval for FRQA are discussed and, based onthe FRQA state, we realize the circuits to accomplish basic audio signaloperations such as signal addition, signal inversion, signal delay, and signalreversal. These operations can be employed as the major components to buildadvanced operations for particular applications in the quantum computingdomain.

Co-Clustering for Multitask Learning

  This paper presents a new multitask learning framework that learns a sharedrepresentation among the tasks, incorporating both task and feature clusters.The jointly-induced clusters yield a shared latent subspace where taskrelationships are learned more effectively and more generally than instate-of-the-art multitask learning methods. The proposed general frameworkenables the derivation of more specific or restricted state-of-the-artmultitask methods. The paper also proposes a highly-scalable multitask learningalgorithm, based on the new framework, using conjugate gradient descent andgeneralized \textit{Sylvester equations}. Experimental results on synthetic andbenchmark datasets show that the proposed method systematically outperformsseveral state-of-the-art multitask learning methods.

DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search

  This paper addresses the scalability challenge of architecture search byformulating the task in a differentiable manner. Unlike conventional approachesof applying evolution or reinforcement learning over a discrete andnon-differentiable search space, our method is based on the continuousrelaxation of the architecture representation, allowing efficient search of thearchitecture using gradient descent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10,ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels indiscovering high-performance convolutional architectures for imageclassification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while beingorders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques.

The calibration and electron energy reconstruction of the BGO ECAL of  the DAMPE detector

  The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space experiment designed tosearch for dark matter indirectly by measuring the spectra of photons,electrons, and positrons up to 10 TeV. The BGO electromagnetic calorimeter(ECAL) is its main sub-detector for energy measurement. In this paper, theinstrumentation and development of the BGO ECAL is briefly described. Thecalibration on the ground, including the pedestal, minimum ionizing particle(MIP) peak, dynode ratio, and attenuation length with the cosmic rays and beamparticles is discussed in detail. Also, the energy reconstruction results ofthe electrons from the beam test are presented.

The dual Minkowski problem for symmetric convex bodies

  The dual Minkowski problem for even data asks what are the necessary andsufficient conditions on an even prescribed measure on the unit sphere for itto be the $q$-th dual curvature measure of an origin-symmetric convex body in$\mathbb{R}^n$. A full solution to this is given when $1 < q < n$.  The necessary and sufficient condition is an explicit measure concentrationcondition. A variational approach is used, where the functional is the sum of adual quermassintegral and an entropy integral. The proof requires two crucialestimates. The first is an estimate of the entropy integral proved using aspherical partition. The second is a sharp estimate of the dualquermassintegrals for a carefully chosen barrier convex body.

Data-driven Random Fourier Features using Stein Effect

  Large-scale kernel approximation is an important problem in machine learningresearch. Approaches using random Fourier features have become increasinglypopular [Rahimi and Recht, 2007], where kernel approximation is treated asempirical mean estimation via Monte Carlo (MC) or Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC)integration [Yang et al., 2014]. A limitation of the current approaches is thatall the features receive an equal weight summing to 1. In this paper, wepropose a novel shrinkage estimator from "Stein effect", which provides adata-driven weighting strategy for random features and enjoys theoreticaljustifications in terms of lowering the empirical risk. We further present anefficient randomized algorithm for large-scale applications of the proposedmethod. Our empirical results on six benchmark data sets demonstrate theadvantageous performance of this approach over representative baselines in bothkernel approximation and supervised learning tasks.

Low Rank Variation Dictionary and Inverse Projection Group Sparse  Representation Model for Breast Tumor Classification

  Sparse representation classification achieves good results by addressingrecognition problem with sufficient training samples per subject. However, SRCperforms not very well for small sample data. In this paper, aninverse-projection group sparse representation model is presented for breasttumor classification, which is based on constructing low-rank variationdictionary. The proposed low-rank variation dictionary tackles tumorrecognition problem from the viewpoint of detecting and using variations ingene expression profiles of normal and patients, rather than directly usingthese samples. The inverse projection group sparsity representation model isconstructed based on taking full using of exist samples and group effect ofmicroarray gene data. Extensive experiments on public breast tumor microarraygene expression datasets demonstrate the proposed technique is competitive withstate-of-the-art methods. The results of Breast-1, Breast-2 and Breast-3databases are 80.81%, 89.10% and 100% respectively, which are better than thelatest literature.

Meta Reinforcement Learning with Distribution of Exploration Parameters  Learned by Evolution Strategies

  In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning method in a reinforcementlearning setting, based on evolution strategies (ES), exploration in parameterspace and deterministic policy gradients. ES methods are easy to parallelize,which is desirable for modern training architectures; however, such methodstypically require a huge number of samples for effective training. We usedeterministic policy gradients during adaptation and other techniques tocompensate for the sample-efficiency problem while maintaining the inherentscalability of ES methods. We demonstrate that our method achieves good resultscompared to gradient-based meta-learning in high-dimensional control tasks inthe MuJoCo simulator. In addition, because of gradient-free methods in themeta-training phase, which do not need information about gradients and policiesin adaptation training, we predict and confirm our algorithm performs better intasks that need multi-step adaptation.

Spin Gap and Resonance at the Nesting Wavevector in Superconducting  FeSe0.4Te0.6

  Neutron scattering is used to probe magnetic excitations inFeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} (T_c=14 K). Low energy spin fluctuations are found with acharacteristic wave vector $(0.5,0.5,L)$ that corresponds to Fermi surfacenesting and differs from Q_m=(\delta,0,0.5) for magnetic ordering inFe_{1+y}Te. A spin resonance with \hbar\Omega_0=6.5 meV \approx 5.3 k_BT_c and\hbar\Gamma=1.25 meV develops in the superconducting state from a normal statecontinuum. We show that the resonance is consistent with a bound stateassociated with s+/- superconductivity and imperfect quasi-2D Fermi surfacenesting.

Strong and nonmonotonic temperature dependence of Hall coefficient in  superconducting K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ single crystals

  In-plane resistivity, magnetoresistance and Hall effect measurements havebeen conducted on quenched K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ single crystals in order toanalysis the normal-state transport properties. It is found that the Kohler'srule is well obeyed below about 80 K, but clearly violated above 80 K.Measurements of the Hall coefficient reveal a strong but non-monotonictemperature dependence with a maximum at about 80 K, in contrast to any otherFeAs-based superconductors. With the two-band model analysis on the Hallcoefficient, we conclude that a gap may open below 65 K. The data above 65 Kare interpreted as a temperature induced crossover from a metallic state at alow temperature to an orbital-selective Mott phase at a high temperature. Thisis consistent with the recent data of angle resolved photoemissionspectroscopy. These results call for a refined theoretical understanding,especially when the hole pockets are absent or become trivial inK$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ superconductors.

Polaron-mediated spin correlations in metallic and insulating  La$_{1-x}A_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, or Ba)

  Neutron spectroscopy measurements reveal short-range spin correlations nearand above the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition in manganitematerials of the form La$_{1-x}A_{x}$MnO$_{3}$, including samples with aninsulating ground state as well as colossal magnetoresistive samples with ametallic ground state. Quasielastic magnetic scattering is revealed that formsclear ridges running along the [100]-type directions in momentum space. Asimple model consisting of a conduction electron hopping between spin polarizedMn ions that becomes self-trapped after a few hops captures the essentialphysics of this magnetic component of the scattering. We associate thisscattering component with the magnetic part of diffuse polarons, as we observea temperature dependence similar to that of the diffuse structural scatteringarising from individual polarons.

Spin Generation Via Bulk Spin Current in Three Dimensional Topological  Insulators

  To date, spin generation in three-dimensional topological insulators isprimarily modeled as a single-surface phenomenon, attributed to themomentum-spin locking on each individual surface. In this article we propose amechanism of spin generation where the role of the insulating yet topologicallynon-trivial bulk becomes explicit: an external electric field creates atransverse pure spin current through the bulk of a three-dimensionaltopological insulator, which transports spins between the top and bottomsurfaces. Under sufficiently high surface disorder, the spin relaxation timecan be extended via the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism. Consequently both the spingeneration efficiency and surface conductivity are largely enhanced. Numericalsimulation confirms that this spin generation mechanism originates from theunique topological connection of the top and bottom surfaces and is absent inother two dimensional systems such as graphene, even though they possess asimilar Dirac cone-type dispersion.

High-Performance Monolayer WS2 Field-effect Transistors on High-k  Dielectrics

  The combination of high-quality Al2O3 dielectric and thiol chemistrypassivation can effectively reduce the density of interface traps and Coulombimpurities of WS2, leading to a significant improvement of the mobility and atransition of the charge transport from the insulating to the metallic regime.A record high mobility of 83 cm2/Vs (337 cm2/Vs) is reached at room temperature(low temperature) for monolayer WS2. A theoretical model for electron transportis also developed.

Realization of Room-Temperature Phonon-limited Carrier Transport in  Monolayer MoS2 by Dielectric and Carrier Screening

  We show that by combining high-k dielectric substrate and high density ofcharge carriers, Coulomb impurity can be effectively screened, leading to anunprecedented room-temperature mobility of ~150cm2/Vs in monolayer MoS2. Thehigh sample quality enables us to quantitatively extract the mobilitycomponents limited by Coulomb impurities, intrinsic and surface opticalphonons, and study their scaling with temperature, carrier density anddielectric constant. The excellent agreement between our theoretical analysisand experimental data demonstrates unambiguously that room-temperaturephonon-limited transport is achieved in monolayer MoS2, which is a necessaryfactor for electronic device applications.

Hot Carrier Trapping Induced Negative Photoconductance in InAs Nanowires  toward Novel Nonvolatile Memory

  We report a novel negative photoconductivity (NPC) mechanism in n-type indiumarsenide nanowires (NWs). Photoexcitation significantly suppresses theconductivity with a gain up to 10^5. The origin of NPC is attributed to thedepletion of conduction channels by light assisted hot electron trapping,supported by gate voltage threshold shift and wavelength dependentphotoconductance measurements. Scanning photocurrent microscopy excludes thepossibility that NPC originates from the NW/metal contacts and reveals acompeting positive photoconductivity. The conductivity recovery afterillumination substantially slows down at low temperature, indicating athermally activated detrapping mechanism. At 78 K, the spontaneous recovery ofthe conductance is completely quenched, resulting in a reversible memory devicewhich can be switched by light and gate voltage pulses. The novel NPC basedoptoelectronics may find exciting applications in photodetection andnonvolatile memory with low power consumption.

Gate-tunable superconducting quantum interference devices of PbS  nanowires

  We report on the fabrication and electrical transport properties ofgate-tunable superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), made ofsemiconducting PbS nanowire contacted with PbIn superconducting electrodes.Applied with a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the nano-hybridSQUID, periodic oscillations of the critical current due to the fluxquantization in SQUID are observed up to T = 4.0 K. Nonsinusoidal current-phaserelationship is obtained as a function of temperature and gate voltage, whichis consistent with a short and diffusive junction model.

Cross-Graph Learning of Multi-Relational Associations

  Cross-graph Relational Learning (CGRL) refers to the problem of predictingthe strengths or labels of multi-relational tuples of heterogeneous objecttypes, through the joint inference over multiple graphs which specify theinternal connections among each type of objects. CGRL is an open challenge inmachine learning due to the daunting number of all possible tuples to deal withwhen the numbers of nodes in multiple graphs are large, and because the labeledtraining instances are extremely sparse as typical. Existing methods such astensor factorization or tensor-kernel machines do not work well because of thelack of convex formulation for the optimization of CGRL models, the poorscalability of the algorithms in handling combinatorial numbers of tuples,and/or the non-transductive nature of the learning methods which limits theirability to leverage unlabeled data in training. This paper proposes a novelframework which formulates CGRL as a convex optimization problem, enablestransductive learning using both labeled and unlabeled tuples, and offers ascalable algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution and enjoys a lineartime complexity with respect to the sizes of input graphs. In our experimentswith a subset of DBLP publication records and an Enzyme multi-source dataset,the proposed method successfully scaled to the large cross-graph inferenceproblem, and outperformed other representative approaches significantly.

Very Strong Superconducting Proximity Effects in PbS Semiconductor  Nanowires

  We report the fabrication of strongly coupled nanohybrid superconductingjunctions using PbS semiconductor nanowires and Pb0.5In0.5 superconductingelectrodes. The maximum supercurrent in the junction reaches up to ~15 \mu A at0.3 K, which is the highest value ever observed in semiconductor-nanowire-basedsuperconducting junctions. The observation of microwave-induced constantvoltage steps confirms the existence of genuine Josephson coupling through thenanowire. Monotonic suppression of the critical current under an externalmagnetic field is also in good agreement with the narrow junction model. Thetemperature-dependent stochastic distribution of the switching current exhibitsa crossover from phase diffusion to a thermal activation process as thetemperature decreases. These strongly coupled nanohybrid superconductingjunctions would be advantageous to the development of gate-tunablesuperconducting quantum information devices.

Modeling Long- and Short-Term Temporal Patterns with Deep Neural  Networks

  Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problemacross many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output,electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise inthese real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term andshort-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressivemodels and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deeplearning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet),to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term localdependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for timeseries trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model totackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In ourevaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns,LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of severalstate-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes areavailable online.

RACE: Large-scale ReAding Comprehension Dataset From Examinations

  We present RACE, a new dataset for benchmark evaluation of methods in thereading comprehension task. Collected from the English exams for middle andhigh school Chinese students in the age range between 12 to 18, RACE consistsof near 28,000 passages and near 100,000 questions generated by human experts(English instructors), and covers a variety of topics which are carefullydesigned for evaluating the students' ability in understanding and reasoning.In particular, the proportion of questions that requires reasoning is muchlarger in RACE than that in other benchmark datasets for reading comprehension,and there is a significant gap between the performance of the state-of-the-artmodels (43%) and the ceiling human performance (95%). We hope this new datasetcan serve as a valuable resource for research and evaluation in machinecomprehension. The dataset is freely available athttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~glai1/data/race/ and the code is available athttps://github.com/qizhex/RACE_AR_baselines.

Cross-lingual Distillation for Text Classification

  Cross-lingual text classification(CLTC) is the task of classifying documentswritten in different languages into the same taxonomy of categories. This paperpresents a novel approach to CLTC that builds on model distillation, whichadapts and extends a framework originally proposed for model compression. Usingsoft probabilistic predictions for the documents in a label-rich language asthe (induced) supervisory labels in a parallel corpus of documents, we trainclassifiers successfully for new languages in which labeled training data arenot available. An adversarial feature adaptation technique is also appliedduring the model training to reduce distribution mismatch. We conductedexperiments on two benchmark CLTC datasets, treating English as the sourcelanguage and German, French, Japan and Chinese as the unlabeled targetlanguages. The proposed approach had the advantageous or comparable performanceof the other state-of-art methods.

Analogical Inference for Multi-Relational Embeddings

  Large-scale multi-relational embedding refers to the task of learning thelatent representations for entities and relations in large knowledge graphs. Aneffective and scalable solution for this problem is crucial for the truesuccess of knowledge-based inference in a broad range of applications. Thispaper proposes a novel framework for optimizing the latent representations withrespect to the \textit{analogical} properties of the embedded entities andrelations. By formulating the learning objective in a differentiable fashion,our model enjoys both theoretical power and computational scalability, andsignificantly outperformed a large number of representative baseline methods onbenchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model offers an elegant unification ofseveral well-known methods in multi-relational embedding, which can be provento be special instantiations of our framework.

Learning Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution from Data Manifold

  Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has gained tremendous success in computervision tasks with its outstanding ability to capture the local latent features.Recently, there has been an increasing interest in extending convolutionoperations to the non-Euclidean geometry. Although various types of convolutionoperations have been proposed for graphs or manifolds, their connections withtraditional convolution over grid-structured data are not well-understood. Inthis paper, we show that depthwise separable convolution can be successfullygeneralized for the unification of both graph-based and grid-based convolutionmethods. Based on this insight we propose a novel Depthwise Separable GraphConvolution (DSGC) approach which is compatible with the tradition convolutionnetwork and subsumes existing convolution methods as special cases. It isequipped with the combined strengths in model expressiveness, compatibility(relatively small number of parameters), modularity and computationalefficiency in training. Extensive experiments show the outstanding performanceof DSGC in comparison with strong baselines on multi-domain benchmark datasets.

Convolutional Normalizing Flows

  Bayesian posterior inference is prevalent in various machine learningproblems. Variational inference provides one way to approximate the posteriordistribution, however its expressive power is limited and so is the accuracy ofresulting approximation. Recently, there has a trend of using neural networksto approximate the variational posterior distribution due to the flexibility ofneural network architecture. One way to construct flexible variationaldistribution is to warp a simple density into a complex by normalizing flows,where the resulting density can be analytically evaluated. However, there is atrade-off between the flexibility of normalizing flow and computation cost forefficient transformation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effectivearchitecture of normalizing flows, ConvFlow, based on convolution over thedimensions of random input vector. Experiments on synthetic and real worldposterior inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency ofthe proposed method.

Asymmetric Variational Autoencoders

  Variational inference for latent variable models is prevalent in variousmachine learning problems, typically solved by maximizing the Evidence LowerBound (ELBO) of the true data likelihood with respect to a variationaldistribution. However, freely enriching the family of variational distributionis challenging since the ELBO requires variational likelihood evaluations ofthe latent variables. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to enrich thevariational family by incorporating auxiliary variables to the variationalfamily. The resulting inference network doesn't require density evaluations forthe auxiliary variables and thus complex implicit densities over the auxiliaryvariables can be constructed by neural networks. It can be shown that theactual variational posterior of the proposed approach is essentially modeling arich probabilistic mixture of simple variational posterior indexed by auxiliaryvariables, thus a flexible inference model can be built. Empirical evaluationson several density estimation tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of theproposed method.

Cooperative Transmission for Physical Layer Security by Exploring Social  Awareness

  Social awareness and social ties are becoming increasingly fashionable withemerging mobile and handheld devices. Social trust degree describing thestrength of the social ties has drawn lots of research interests in many fieldsincluding secure cooperative communications. Such trust degree reflects theusers' willingness for cooperation, which impacts the selection of thecooperative users in the practical networks. In this paper, we propose acooperative relay and jamming selection scheme to secure communication based onthe social trust degree under a stochastic geometry framework. We aim toanalyze the involved secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the system'sperformance. To achieve this target, we propose a double Gamma ratio (DGR)approach through Gamma approximation. Based on this, the SOP is tractablyobtained in closed form. The simulation results verify our theoreticalfindings, and validate that the social trust degree has dramatic influences onthe network's secrecy performance.

Fabrication and Characterization of Superconducting Quantum Interference  Device using (Bi_{1-x}Sb_x)_2Se_3 Topological Insulator Nanoribbons

  We report on the fabrication and electrical transport properties ofsuperconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) made from a(Bi_{1-x}Sb_x)_2Se_3 topological insulator (TI) nanoribbon (NR) connected withPb0.5In0.5 superconducting electrodes. Below the transition temperature of thesuperconducting Pb0.5In0.5 electrodes, periodic oscillations of the criticalcurrent are observed in the TI NR SQUID under a magnetic field appliedperpendicular to the plane owing to flux quantization. Also the output voltagemodulates as a function of the external magnetic field. Moreover, the SQUID theSQUID shows a voltage modulation envelope, which is considered to represent theFraunhofer-like patterns of each single junction. These properties of the TI NRSQUID would provide a useful method to explore Majorana fermions.

Quantum critical behavior in Ce(Fe$_{0.76}$Ru$_{0.24}$)$_2$Ge$_2$: the  full story

  Systems with embedded magnetic ions that exhibit a competition betweenmagnetic order and disorder down to absolute zero can display unusual lowtemperature behaviors of the resistivity, susceptibility, and specific heat.Moreover, the dynamic response of such a system can display hyperscalingbehavior in which the relaxation back to equilibrium when an amount of energy Eis given to the system at temperature T only depends on the ratio E/T.Ce(Fe$_{0.755}$Ru$_{0.245}$)$_2$Ge$_2$ is a system that displays thesebehaviors. We show that these complex behaviors are rooted in a fragmentationof the magnetic lattice upon cooling caused by a distribution of local Kondoscreening temperatures, and that the hyperscaling behavior can be attributed tothe flipping of the total magnetic moment of magnetic clusters thatspontaneously form and order upon cooling. We present our arguments based onthe review of two-decades worth of neutron scattering and transport data onthis system, augmented with new polarized neutron scattering experiments.

Full 3D Reconstruction of Transparent Objects

  Numerous techniques have been proposed for reconstructing 3D models foropaque objects in past decades. However, none of them can be directly appliedto transparent objects. This paper presents a fully automatic approach forreconstructing complete 3D shapes of transparent objects. Through positioningan object on a turntable, its silhouettes and light refraction paths underdifferent viewing directions are captured. Then, starting from an initial roughmodel generated from space carving, our algorithm progressively optimizes themodel under three constraints: surface and refraction normal consistency,surface projection and silhouette consistency, and surface smoothness.Experimental results on both synthetic and real objects demonstrate that ourmethod can successfully recover the complex shapes of transparent objects andfaithfully reproduce their light refraction properties.

Stochastic WaveNet: A Generative Latent Variable Model for Sequential  Data

  How to model distribution of sequential data, including but not limited tospeech and human motions, is an important ongoing research problem. It has beendemonstrated that model capacity can be significantly enhanced by introducingstochastic latent variables in the hidden states of recurrent neural networks.Simultaneously, WaveNet, equipped with dilated convolutions, achievesastonishing empirical performance in natural speech generation task. In thispaper, we combine the ideas from both stochastic latent variables and dilatedconvolutions, and propose a new architecture to model sequential data, termedas Stochastic WaveNet, where stochastic latent variables are injected into theWaveNet structure. We argue that Stochastic WaveNet enjoys powerfuldistribution modeling capacity and the advantage of parallel training fromdilated convolutions. In order to efficiently infer the posterior distributionof the latent variables, a novel inference network structure is designed basedon the characteristics of WaveNet architecture. State-of-the-art performanceson benchmark datasets are obtained by Stochastic WaveNet on natural speechmodeling and high quality human handwriting samples can be generated as well.

Unsupervised Cross-lingual Transfer of Word Embedding Spaces

  Cross-lingual transfer of word embeddings aims to establish the semanticmappings among words in different languages by learning the transformationfunctions over the corresponding word embedding spaces. Successfully solvingthis problem would benefit many downstream tasks such as to translate textclassification models from resource-rich languages (e.g. English) tolow-resource languages. Supervised methods for this problem rely on theavailability of cross-lingual supervision, either using parallel corpora orbilingual lexicons as the labeled data for training, which may not be availablefor many low resource languages. This paper proposes an unsupervised learningapproach that does not require any cross-lingual labeled data. Given twomonolingual word embedding spaces for any language pair, our algorithmoptimizes the transformation functions in both directions simultaneously basedon distributional matching as well as minimizing the back-translation losses.We use a neural network implementation to calculate the Sinkhorn distance, awell-defined distributional similarity measure, and optimize our objectivethrough back-propagation. Our evaluation on benchmark datasets for bilinguallexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity prediction shows strongeror competitive performance of the proposed method compared to otherstate-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised baseline methods over manylanguage pairs.

Switch-based Active Deep Dyna-Q: Efficient Adaptive Planning for  Task-Completion Dialogue Policy Learning

  Training task-completion dialogue agents with reinforcement learning usuallyrequires a large number of real user experiences. The Dyna-Q algorithm extendsQ-learning by integrating a world model, and thus can effectively boosttraining efficiency using simulated experiences generated by the world model.The effectiveness of Dyna-Q, however, depends on the quality of the world model- or implicitly, the pre-specified ratio of real vs. simulated experiences usedfor Q-learning. To this end, we extend the recently proposed Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ)framework by integrating a switcher that automatically determines whether touse a real or simulated experience for Q-learning. Furthermore, we explore theuse of active learning for improving sample efficiency, by encouraging theworld model to generate simulated experiences in the state-action space wherethe agent has not (fully) explored. Our results show that by combining switcherand active learning, the new framework named as Switch-based Active Deep Dyna-Q(Switch-DDQ), leads to significant improvement over DDQ and Q-learningbaselines in both simulation and human evaluations.

Kernel Change-point Detection with Auxiliary Deep Generative Models

  Detecting the emergence of abrupt property changes in time series is achallenging problem. Kernel two-sample test has been studied for this taskwhich makes fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametricapproaches. However, selecting kernels is non-trivial in practice. Althoughkernel selection for two-sample test has been studied, the insufficient samplesin change point detection problem hinder the success of those developed kernelselection algorithms. In this paper, we propose KL-CPD, a novel kernel learningframework for time series CPD that optimizes a lower bound of test power via anauxiliary generative model. With deep kernel parameterization, KL-CPD endowskernel two-sample test with the data-driven kernel to detect different types ofchange-points in real-world applications. The proposed approach significantlyoutperformed other state-of-the-art methods in our comparative evaluation ofbenchmark datasets and simulation studies.

An Adversarial Approach to High-Quality, Sentiment-Controlled Neural  Dialogue Generation

  In this work, we propose a method for neural dialogue response generationthat allows not only generating semantically reasonable responses according tothe dialogue history, but also explicitly controlling the sentiment of theresponse via sentiment labels. Our proposed model is based on the paradigm ofconditional adversarial learning; the training of a sentiment-controlleddialogue generator is assisted by an adversarial discriminator which assessesthe fluency and feasibility of the response generating from the dialoguehistory and a given sentiment label. Because of the flexibility of ourframework, the generator could be a standard sequence-to-sequence (SEQ2SEQ)model or a more complicated one such as a conditional variationalautoencoder-based SEQ2SEQ model. Experimental results using automatic and humanevaluation both demonstrate that our proposed framework is able to generateboth semantically reasonable and sentiment-controlled dialogue responses.

Re-examination of the Role of Latent Variables in Sequence Modeling

  With latent variables, stochastic recurrent models have achievedstate-of-the-art performance in modeling sound-wave sequence. However, oppositeresults are also observed in other domains, where standard recurrent networksoften outperform stochastic models. To better understand this discrepancy, were-examine the roles of latent variables in stochastic recurrent models forspeech density estimation. Our analysis reveals that under the restriction offully factorized output distribution in previous evaluations, the stochasticmodels were implicitly leveraging intra-step correlation but the standardrecurrent baselines were prohibited to do so, resulting in an unfaircomparison. To correct the unfairness, we remove such restriction in ourre-examination, where all the models can explicitly leverage intra-stepcorrelation with an auto-regressive structure. Over a diverse set of sequentialdata, including human speech, MIDI music, handwriting trajectory andframe-permuted speech, our results show that stochastic recurrent models failto exhibit any practical advantage despite the claimed theoretical superiority.In contrast, standard recurrent models equipped with an auto-regressive outputdistribution consistently perform better, significantly advancing thestate-of-the-art results on three speech datasets.

Implicit Kernel Learning

  Kernels are powerful and versatile tools in machine learning and statistics.Although the notion of universal kernels and characteristic kernels has beenstudied, kernel selection still greatly influences the empirical performance.While learning the kernel in a data driven way has been investigated, in thispaper we explore learning the spectral distribution of kernel via implicitgenerative models parametrized by deep neural networks. We called our methodImplicit Kernel Learning (IKL). The proposed framework is simple to train andinference is performed via sampling random Fourier features. We investigate twoapplications of the proposed IKL as examples, including generative adversarialnetworks with MMD (MMD GAN) and standard supervised learning. Empirically, MMDGAN with IKL outperforms vanilla predefined kernels on both image and textgeneration benchmarks; using IKL with Random Kitchen Sinks also leads tosubstantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art kernel learningalgorithms on popular supervised learning benchmarks. Theory and conditions forusing IKL in both applications are also studied as well as connections toprevious state-of-the-art methods.

A van der Waals pn heterojunction with organic/inorganic semiconductors

  van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions formed by two-dimensional (2D) materialshave attracted tremendous attention due to their excellent electrical/opticalproperties and device applications. However, current 2D heterojunctions arelargely limited to atomic crystals, and hybrid organic/inorganic structures arerarely explored. Here, we fabricate hybrid 2D heterostructures with p-typedioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene (C8-BTBT) and n-type MoS2. We find thatfew-layer C8-BTBT molecular crystals can be grown on monolayer MoS2 by vdWepitaxy, with pristine interface and controllable thickness down to monolayer.The operation of the C8-BTBT/MoS2 vertical heterojunction devices is highlytunable by bias and gate voltages between three different regimes: interfacialrecombination, tunneling and blocking. The pn junction shows diode-likebehavior with rectifying ratio up to 105 at the room temperature. Our devicesalso exhibit photovoltaic responses with power conversion efficiency of 0.31%and photoresponsivity of 22mA/W. With wide material combinations, such hybrid2D structures will offer possibilities for opto-electronic devices that are notpossible from individual constituents.

Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context

  Transformer networks have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, butare limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. As asolution, we propose a novel neural architecture, Transformer-XL, that enablesTransformer to learn dependency beyond a fixed length without disruptingtemporal coherence. Concretely, it consists of a segment-level recurrencemechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enablescapturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the problem of contextfragmentation. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is about 80%longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves betterperformance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times fasterthan vanilla Transformer during evaluation. Additionally, we improve thestate-of-the-art (SoTA) results of bpc/perplexity from 1.06 to 0.99 on enwiki8,from 1.13 to 1.08 on text8, from 20.5 to 18.3 on WikiText-103, from 23.7 to21.8 on One Billion Word, and from 55.3 to 54.5 on Penn Treebank (withoutfinetuning). Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available inboth Tensorflow and PyTorch.

Robust linear magnetoresistance in WTe2

  Unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) has been reported in WTe2, and remainsirrepressible up to very high field. Intense optimization of the crystallinequality causes a squarely-increasing MR, as interpreted by perfect compensationof opposite carriers. Herein we report our observation of linear MR (LMR) inWTe2 crystals, the onset of which is first identified by constructing themobility spectra of the MR at low fields. The LMR further intensifies andpredominates at fields higher than 20 Tesla while the parabolic MR graduallydecays. The LMR remains unsaturated up to a high field of 60 Tesla andpersists, even at a high pressure of 6.2 GPa. Assisted by density functionaltheory calculations and detailed mobility spectra, we find the LMR to be robustagainst the applications of high field, broken carrier balance, and mobilitysuppression. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a uniquequasilinear energy dispersion near the Fermi level. Our results suggest thatthe robust LMR is the low bound of the unsaturated MR in WTe2.

MMD GAN: Towards Deeper Understanding of Moment Matching Network

  Generative moment matching network (GMMN) is a deep generative model thatdiffers from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing thediscriminator in GAN with a two-sample test based on kernel maximum meandiscrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have beenstudied, the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as thatof GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computationalefficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially dueto its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In thispaper, we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and itscomputational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques,as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The newapproach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN, hence we name it MMD GAN.The new distance measure in MMD GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys theadvantage of weak topology and can be optimized via gradient descent withrelatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets,including MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CelebA and LSUN, the performance of MMD-GANsignificantly outperforms GMMN, and is competitive with other representativeGAN works.

Enhancing the magnetoelectric coupling of Co4Nb2O9[100] by substitution  of Mg for Co

  We report experimental studies on enhancing the magnetoelectric (ME) couplingof Co$_4$Nb$_2$O$_9$ by substitution of non-magnetic metal Mg for Co. A seriesof single crystal Co$_{4-x}$Mg$_x$Nb$_2$O$_9$ (x=0, 1, 2, 3) with asingle-phase corundum-type structure are synthesized by the optical floatingzone method, and the good quality and crystallographic orientations of thesynthesized samples are confirmed by Laue spots and sharp XRD peaks. Althoughthe Neel temperature ($T_N$) of the Mg substituted crystals are slightlydecreased from 27 K for pure Co$_4$Nb$_2$O$_9$ to 19 K and 11 K forCo$_3$MgNb$_2$O$_9$ and Co$_2$Mg$_2$Nb$_2$O$_9$, respectively, the ME couplingis double enhanced by Mg substitution when x=1. For the magnetic field(electric field) control of electric polarization (magnetization), the MEcoefficient $\alpha_{ME}$ of Co$_3$MgNb$_2$O$_9$ is measured to be 12.8 ps/m(13.7 ps/m). These results indicate that the Mg substitutedCo$_{4-x}$Mg$_x$Nb$_2$O$_9$ (x=1) could serve as a potential material candidatefor applications in future logic spintronics and logic devices.
