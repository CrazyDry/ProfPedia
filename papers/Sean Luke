Multiagent Soft Q-Learning

  Policy gradient methods are often applied to reinforcement learning incontinuous multiagent games. These methods perform local search in thejoint-action space, and as we show, they are susceptable to a game-theoreticpathology known as relative overgeneralization. To resolve this issue, wepropose Multiagent Soft Q-learning, which can be seen as the analogue ofapplying Q-learning to continuous controls. We compare our method to MADDPG, astate-of-the-art approach, and show that our method achieves bettercoordination in multiagent cooperative tasks, converging to better local optimain the joint action space.

Hierarchical Approaches for Reinforcement Learning in Parameterized  Action Space

  We explore Deep Reinforcement Learning in a parameterized action space.Specifically, we investigate how to achieve sample-efficient end-to-endtraining in these tasks. We propose a new compact architecture for the taskswhere the parameter policy is conditioned on the output of the discrete actionpolicy. We also propose two new methods based on the state-of-the-artalgorithms Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Stochastic ValueGradient (SVG) to train such an architecture. We demonstrate that these methodsoutperform the state of the art method, Parameterized Action DDPG, on testdomains.

Summing Sudakov logarithms in B -> X_s + gamma in effective field theory

  We construct an effective field theory valid for processes in which highlyenergetic light-like particles interact with collinear and soft degrees offreedom, using the decay B -> X_s + gamma near the endpoint of the photonspectrum, x = 2 E_gamma / m_b -> 1, as an example. Below the scale mu=m_b bothsoft and collinear degrees of freedom are included in the effective theory,while below the scale mu=m_b sqrt{x-y}, where 1-y is the lightcone momentumfraction of the b quark in the B meson, we match onto a theory of bilocaloperators. We show that at one loop large logarithms cancel in the matchingconditions, and that we recover the well known renormalization group equationsthat sum leading Sudakov logarithms.

Turbulence in Core-Collapse Supernovae

  Multidimensional simulations show that non-radial, turbulent, fluid motion isa fundamental component of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosionmechanism. Neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shockinstability, and relic-perturbations from advanced stages of nuclear burningcan all impact the outcome of core collapse in a qualitative and quantitativeway. Here, we review the current understanding of these phenomena and theirrole in the explosion of massive stars. We also discuss the role ofprotoneutron star convection and of magnetic fields in the context of thedelayed neutrino mechanism.

Compton Scattering from the Deuteron below Pion-Production Threshold

  Differential cross sections for elastic scattering of photons from thedeuteron have recently been measured at the Tagged-Photon Facility at the MAXIV Laboratory in Lund, Sweden. These first new measurements in more than adecade further constrain the isoscalar electromagnetic polarizabilities of thenucleon and provide the first-ever results above 100 MeV, where the sensitivityto the polarizabilities is increased. We add 23 points between 70 and 112 MeV,at angles 60deg, 120deg and 150deg. Analysis of these data using a ChiralEffective Field Theory indicates that the cross sections are bothself-consistent and consistent with previous measurements. Extracted values of\alpha_s = [12.1 +/- 0.8(stat) +/- 0.2(BSR) +/- 0.8(th)] X 10^{-4} fm^3 and\beta_s = [2.4 +/- 0.8(stat) +/- 0.2(BSR) +/- 0.8(th)] X 10^{-4} fm^3 areobtained from a fit to these 23 new data points. This paper presents in detailthe experimental conditions and the data analysis used to extract the crosssections.

Magnons and Phonons Optically Driven Out of Local Equilibrium in a  Magnetic Insulator

  Magnons are the energy quanta of fundamental spin excitations, namely spinwaves, and they can make a considerable contribution to energy transport insome magnetic materials in a similar manner as lattice vibration waves orphonons. The coupling and possible non-equilibrium between magnons and otherenergy carriers have been used to explain several recently discovered thermallydriven spin transport and energy conversion phenomena. Here, we reportexperiments in which local non-equilibrium between magnons and phonons in asingle crystalline bulk magnetic insulator, Y3Fe5O12 (yttrium iron garnet, orYIG), has been created optically within a focused laser spot and probeddirectly with the use of micro-Brillouin light scattering (BLS). By analyzingthe experimental results with a thermally induced magnon diffusion model, weobtain the magnon diffusion length of thermal magnons. By explicitlyestablishing non-equilibrium between magnons and phonons, our studies representan important step toward a quantitative understanding of various spin-heatcoupling phenomena.

Solar System Ice Giants: Exoplanets in our Backyard

  Future remote sensing of exoplanets will be enhanced by a thoroughinvestigation of our solar system Ice Giants (Neptune-size planets). What canthe configuration of the magnetic field tell us (remotely) about the interior,and what implications does that field have for the structure of themagnetosphere; energy input into the atmosphere, and surface geophysics (forexample surface weathering of satellites that might harbour sub-surfaceoceans). How can monitoring of auroral emission help inform future remoteobservations of emission from exoplanets? Our Solar System provides the onlylaboratory in which we can perform in-situ experiments to understand exoplanetformation, dynamos, systems and magnetospheres.

Multiwavelength study of the newly confirmed supernova remnant MCSNR  J0527-7104 in the Large Magellanic Cloud

  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) hosts a rich and varied population ofsupernova remnants (SNRs). Optical, X-ray, and radio observations are requiredto identify these SNRs, as well as to ascertain the various processesresponsible for the large array of physical characteristics observed. In thispaper we attempted to confirm the candidate SNR [HP99] 1234, identified inX-rays with ROSAT, as a true SNR by supplementing these X-ray data with opticaland radio observations. Optical data from the Magellanic Cloud Emission LineSurvey (MCELS) and new radio data from the Molonglo Observatory SynthesisTelescope (MOST), in addition to the ROSAT X-ray data, were used to perform amorphological analysis of this candidate SNR. An approximately ellipsoidalshell of enhanced [SII], typical of an SNR ([SII]/Halpha > 0.4), was detectedin the optical. This enhancement is coincident with faint radio emission at 36cm. Using the available data we estimated the size of the remnant to be ~5.1' x4.0' (~75 pc x 59 pc). However, the measurement along the major-axis wassomewhat uncertain due to a lack of optical and radio emission at itsextremities and the poor resolution of the X-ray data. Assuming this SNR is inthe Sedov phase and adopting the ambient mass density of 1.2x10^-25 g cm^-3measured in a nearby HII region, an age estimate of ~25 kyr was calculated fora canonical initial explosion energy of 10^51 erg. However, this age estimateshould be treated cautiously due to uncertainties on the adopted parameters.Analysis of the local stellar population suggested a type Ia event as aprecursor to this SNR, however, a core-collapse mechanism could not be ruledout due to the possibility of the progenitor being a runaway massive star. Withthe detection of X-ray, radio and optical line emission with enhanced [SII],this object was confirmed as an SNR and we assign the identifier MCSNRJ0527-7104.

Multi-frequency study of DEM L299 in the Large Magellanic Cloud

  We have studied the HII region DEM L299 in the Large Magellanic Cloud tounderstand its physical characteristics and morphology in differentwavelengths. We performed a spectral analysis of archived XMM-Newton EPIC dataand studied the morphology of DEM L299 in X-ray, optical, and radiowavelengths. We used H alpha, [SII], and [OIII] data from the Magellanic CloudEmission Line Survey and radio 21 cm line data from the Australia TelescopeCompact Array (ATCA) and the Parkes telescope, and radio continuum data fromATCA and the Molonglo Synthesis Telescope. Our morphological studies implythat, in addition to the supernova remnant SNR B0543-68.9 reported in previousstudies, a superbubble also overlaps the SNR in projection. The position of theSNR is clearly defined through the [SII]/H alpha flux ratio image. Moreover,the optical images show a shell-like structure that is located farther to thenorth and is filled with diffuse X-ray emission, which again indicates thesuperbubble. Radio 21 cm line data show a shell around both objects. Radiocontinuum data show diffuse emission at the position of DEM L299, which appearsclearly distinguished from the HII region N 164 that lies south-west of it. Wedetermined the spectral index of SNR B0543-68.9 to be alpha=-0.34, whichindicates the dominance of thermal emission and therefore a rather mature SNR.We determined the basic properties of the diffuse X-ray emission for the SNR,the superbubble, and a possible blowout region of the bubble, as suggested bythe optical and X-ray data. We obtained an age of 8.9 (3.5-18.1) kyr for theSNR and a temperature of 0.64 (0.44-1.37) keV for the hot gas inside the SNR,and a temperature of the hot gas inside the superbubble of 0.74 (0.44-1.1) keV.We conclude that DEM L299 consists of a superposition of SNR B0543-68.9 and asuperbubble, which we identified based on optical data.

Two evolved supernova remnants with newly identified Fe-rich cores in  the Large Magellanic Cloud

  Aims. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the evolved supernovaremnants MCSNR J0506-7025 and MCSNR J0527-7104 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.Methods. We used data from XMM-Newton, the Australian Telescope Compact Array,and the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey to study their broadband emissionand used Spitzer and HI data to gain a picture of their environments. Weperformed a multi-wavelength morphological study and detailed radio and X-rayspectral analyses to determine their physical characteristics. Results. Bothremnants were found to have bright X-ray cores, dominated by Fe L-shellemission, consistent with reverse shock heated ejecta with determined Fe massesin agreement with Type Ia explosion yields. A soft X-ray shell, consistent withswept-up interstellar medium, was observed in MCSNR J0506-7025, suggestive of aremnant in the Sedov phase. Using the spectral fit results and the Sedovself-similar solution, we estimated the age of MCSNR J0506-7025 to be ~16-28kyr, with an initial explosion energy of (0.07-0.84)x10^51 erg. A soft shellwas absent in MCSNR J0527-7104, with only ejecta emission visible in anextremely elongated morphology extending beyond the optical shell. We suggestthat the blast wave has broken out into a low density cavity, allowing theshock heated ejecta to escape. We found that the radio spectral index of MCSNRJ0506-7025 is consistent with the standard ~0.5 for SNRs. Radio polarisation at6 cm indicates a higher degree of polarisation along the western front and atthe eastern knot, with a mean fractional polarisation across the remnant ofP~(20 \pm 6)%. Conclusions. The detection of Fe-rich ejecta in the remnantssuggests that both resulted from Type Ia explosions. The newly identifiedFe-rich cores in MCSNR J0506-7025 and MCSNR J0527-7104 makes them members ofthe expanding class of evolved Fe-rich remnants in the Magellanic Clouds.

FRIB and the GW170817 Kilonova

  In July 2018 an FRIB Theory Alliance program was held on the implications ofGW170817 and its associated kilonova for r-process nucleosynthesis. Topics ofdiscussion included the astrophysical and nuclear physics uncertainties in theinterpretation of the GW170817 kilonova, what we can learn about theastrophysical site or sites of the r process from this event, and the advancesin nuclear experiment and theory most crucial to pursue in light of the newdata. Here we compile a selection of scientific contributions to the workshop,broadly representative of progress in r-process studies since the GW170817event.

Catching Element Formation In The Act

  Gamma-ray astronomy explores the most energetic photons in nature to addresssome of the most pressing puzzles in contemporary astrophysics. It encompassesa wide range of objects and phenomena: stars, supernovae, novae, neutron stars,stellar-mass black holes, nucleosynthesis, the interstellar medium, cosmic raysand relativistic-particle acceleration, and the evolution of galaxies. MeVgamma-rays provide a unique probe of nuclear processes in astronomy, directlymeasuring radioactive decay, nuclear de-excitation, and positron annihilation.The substantial information carried by gamma-ray photons allows us to seedeeper into these objects, the bulk of the power is often emitted at gamma-rayenergies, and radioactivity provides a natural physical clock that adds uniqueinformation. New science will be driven by time-domain population studies atgamma-ray energies. This science is enabled by next-generation gamma-rayinstruments with one to two orders of magnitude better sensitivity, larger skycoverage, and faster cadence than all previous gamma-ray instruments. Thistransformative capability permits: (a) the accurate identification of thegamma-ray emitting objects and correlations with observations taken at otherwavelengths and with other messengers; (b) construction of new gamma-ray mapsof the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies where extended regions aredistinguished from point sources; and (c) considerable serendipitous science ofscarce events -- nearby neutron star mergers, for example. Advances intechnology push the performance of new gamma-ray instruments to address a wideset of astrophysical questions.

A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

  Particle physics has an ambitious and broad experimental programme for thecoming decades. This programme requires large investments in detector hardware,either to build new facilities and experiments, or to upgrade existing ones.Similarly, it requires commensurate investment in the R&D of software toacquire, manage, process, and analyse the shear amounts of data to be recorded.In planning for the HL-LHC in particular, it is critical that all of thecollaborating stakeholders agree on the software goals and priorities, and thatthe efforts complement each other. In this spirit, this white paper describesthe R&D activities required to prepare for this software upgrade.

The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment: Exploring Fundamental Symmetries  of the Universe

  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early Universe, thedynamics of the supernova bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary forlife and whether protons eventually decay --- these mysteries at the forefrontof particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the earlyevolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. TheLong-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developedplan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNEis conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensityneutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at FermiNational Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstreamof the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployedas a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground ResearchFacility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine inLead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source atFermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrinocharge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yetcost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and canaccommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptionalcombination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, andpotential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facilityfor the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from aroundthe globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year programof exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview ofLBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physicsworldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it willpossess.
