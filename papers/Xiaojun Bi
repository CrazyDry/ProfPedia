Calabi-Yau algebras and the shifted noncommutative symplectic structure

  In this paper we show that for a Koszul Calabi-Yau algebra, there is ashifted bi-symplectic structure in the sense ofCrawley-Boevey-Etingof-Ginzburg, on the cobar construction of its co-unitalizedKoszul dual coalgebra, and hence its DG representation schemes, in the sense ofBerest-Khachatryan-Ramadoss, have a shifted symplectic structure in the senseof Pantev-To\"en-Vaqui\'e-Vezzosi.

VHE gamma ray absorption by galactic interstellar radiation field

  Adopting a recent calculation of the Galactic interstellar radiation field,we calculate the attenuation of the very high energy gamma rays from theGalactic sources. The infra-red radiation background near the Galactic Centeris very intense due to the new calculation and our result shows that a cutoffof high energy gamma ray spectrum begins at about 20 TeV and reaches about 10%for 50 TeV gamma rays.

The Galactic positron flux and dark matter substructures

  In this paper we calculate the Galactic positron flux from dark matterannihilation in the frame of supersymmetry, taking the enhancement of the fluxby existence of dark matter substructures into account. The propagation ofpositrons in the Galactic magnetic field is solved in a realistic numericalmodel GALPROP. The secondary positron flux is recalculated in the GLAPROPmodel. The total positron flux from secondary products and dark matterannihilation can fit the HEAT data well when taking a cuspy density profile ofthe substructures.

Lepton flavor violation in lopsided models and a neutrino mass model

  A widely adopted theoretical scheme to account for the neutrino oscillationphenomena is the see-saw mechanism together with the ``lopsided'' massmatrices, which is generally realized in the framework of supersymmetric grandunification. We will show that this scheme leads to large lepton flavorviolation at low energy if supersymmetry is broken at the GUT or Plank scale.Especially, the branching ratio of $\mu\to e\gamma$ already exceeds the presentexperimental limit. We then propose a phenomenological model, which can accountfor the LMA solution to the solar neutrino problem and at the same time predictbranching ratio of $\mu\to e\gamma$ below the present limit.

Correlation between LFV and muon (g-2) in MSSM

  We give a simultaneous analysis of $g_\mu-2$ and lepton flavor violationwithin MSSM. Working on the interaction basis, we give direct relations between$\delta a_\mu$ and Br$(\tau\to\mu\gamma)$ induced by the supersymmetricparticles. We find the SUSY parameter space to satisfy the $g_\mu-2$ constraintcan be considerably different from that given in case of no lepton flavormixing in the soft SUSY breaking sector.

Fermionic partner of Quintessence field as candidate for dark matter

  Quintessence is a possible candidate for dark energy. In this paper we studythe phenomenologies of the fermionic partner of Quintessence, the Quintessino.Our results show that, for suitable choices of the model parameters, theQuintessino is a good candidate for cold or warm dark matter. In our scenario,dark energy and dark matter of the Universe are connected in one chiralsuperfield.

Status of Dark Matter Detection

  The detection of dark matter has made great progresses in recent years. Wegive a brief review on the status and progress in dark matter detection,including the progresses in direct detection, collider detection at LHC andfocus on the indirect detection. The results from PAMELA, ATIC, Fermi-LAT andrelevant studies on these results are introduced. Then we give the progress onindirect detection of gamma rays from Fermi-LAT and ground based Cerenkovtelescopes. Finally the detection of neutrinos and constraints on the nature ofdark matter are reviewed briefly.

Two new multi-component BKP hierarchies

  We firstly propose two kinds of new multi-component BKP (mcBKP) hierarchybased on the eigenfunction symmetry reduction and nonstandard reduction,respectively. The first one contains two types of BKP equation withself-consistent sources which Lax representations are presented. The two mcBKPhierarchies both admit reductions to the $k-$constrained BKP hierarchy and tointegrable (1+1)-dimensional hierarchy with self-consistent sources, whichinclude two types of SK equation with self-consistent sources and ofbi-directional SK equations with self-consistent sources.

A new multi-component CKP hierarchy

  We construct a new multi-component CKP hierarchy based on the eigenfunctionsymmetry reduction. It contains two types of CKP equation with self-consistentsources which Lax representations are presented. Also it admits reductions to$k$-constrained CKP hierarchy and to a (1+1)-dimensional soliton hierarchy withself-consistent source, which include two types of Kaup-Kuperschmidt equationwith self-consistent sources and of bi-directional Kaup-Kuperschmidt equationwith self-consistent sources.

Gamma rays from the neutralino dark matter annihilations in the Milky  Way substructures

  High resolution simulations reveal that in the cold dark matter scenario thestructures form hierarchically and a large number of substructures survive inthe galactic halos. The substructures can be probed if they emit gamma rays viadark matter annihilation. We calculated the gamma ray fluxes from the darkmatter annihilations in the substructures of our Galaxy within the frame of theminimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. The uncertainties ofthe prediction from both the low energy supersymmetry and especially from thedensity profiles of dark matter in the substructures are carefullyinvestigated. The cumulative number of substructures emitting gamma rays aboveany given flux is calculated. Detectability of the gamma rays from thesubstructures is discussed. We propose the viability to detect these signalsthrough the ground large field of view detectors.

Gamma rays from dark matter annihilation in the Draco and observability  at ARGO

  The CACTUS experiment recently observed a gamma ray excess above 50 GeV fromthe direction of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Considering that Draco isdark matter dominated the gamma rays may be generated through dark matterannihilation in the Draco halo. In the framework of the minimal supersymmetricextension of the standard model we explore the parameter space to account forthe gamma ray signals at CACTUS. We find that the neutralino mass isconstrained to be approximately in the range between 100 GeV ~ 400 GeV and asharp central cuspy of the dark halo profile in Draco is necessary to explainthe CACTUS results. We then discuss further constraints on the supersymmetricparameter space by observations at the ground based ARGO detector. It is foundthat the parameter space can be strongly constrained by ARGO if no excess fromDraco is observed above 100 GeV.

The diffuse Galactic gamma-rays from dark matter annihilation

  The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-rays from EGRET observation shows excessesabove 1 GeV in comparison with the expectations from conventional Galacticcosmic ray (CR) propagation model. In the work we try to solve the "GeV excess"problem by dark matter (DM) annihilation in the frame of supersymmetry (SUSY).Compared with previous works, there are three aspects improved in this work:first, the direction-independent "boost factor" for diffuse $\gamma$-rays fromdark matter annihilation (DMA) is naturally reproduced by taking the DMsubstructures into account; second, there is no need for renormalization of thediffuse $\gamma$-ray background produced by CRs; last but not the least, inthis work our new propagation model can give consistent results of both diffuse$\gamma$-rays and antiprotons, by directly adding the signals from DMA to thediffuse $\gamma$-ray background. This is a self-consistent model among severalpossible scenarios at present, and can be tested or optimized by theforthcoming experiments such as GLAST, PAMELA and AMS02.

LMA Solution to the Solar Neutrino Problem and a Phenomenological  Charged Lepton Mass Matrix

  We propose a phenomenological form of the charged lepton mass matrix, whichextends the idea of ``lopsided'' mass matrix in the literature. The features ofthe form are that both the 2-3 and 1-3 elements of the charged lepton massmatrix are of order 1 and that the small elements have a new structure . Thisform leads to an interesting result that both large atmospheric and solarneutrino mixing can be accounted for by the matrix. Another interesting resultof this mass matrix is that it leads to very small 1-3 mixing in the leptonsector and can suppress the branching ratio of $\mu\to e\gamma$ under thepresent experimental limit in the supersymmetric see-saw case.

Muon anomalous magnetic moment and lepton flavor violation in MSSM

  We give a thorough analysis of the correlation between the muon anomalousmagnetic moment and the radiative lepton flavor violating (LFV) processeswithin the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We find that in the case whenthe slepton mass eigenstates are nearly degenerate, $\delta a_\mu$, coming fromSUSY contributions, hardly depends on the lepton flavor mixing and, thus, thereis no direct relation between $\delta a_\mu$ and the LFV processes. On thecontrary, if the first two generations' sleptons are much heavier than the 3rdone, i.e., in the effective SUSY scenario, the two quantities are closelyrelated. In the latter scenario, the SUSY parameter space to account for theexperimental $\delta a_\mu$ is quite different from the case of no leptonflavor mixing. Especially, the Higgsino mass parameter $\mu$ can be eitherpositive or negative.

Thermal leptogenesis in a model with mass varying neutrinos

  In this paper we consider the possibility of neutrino mass varying during theevolution of the Universe and study its implications on leptogenesis.Specifically, we take the minimal seesaw model of neutrino masses and introducea coupling between the right-handed neutrinos and the dark energy scalar field,the Quintessence. In our model, the right-handed neutrino masses change as theQuintessence scalar evolves. We then examine in detail the parameter space ofthis model allowed by the observed baryon number asymmetry. Our results showthat it is possible to lower the reheating temperature in this scenario incomparison with the case that the neutrino masses are unchanged, which helpssolve the gravitino problem. Furthermore, a degenerate neutrino mass pattenwith $m_i$ larger than the upper limit given in the minimal leptogenesisscenario is permitted.

Phenomenology of quintessino dark matter -- Production of NLSP particles

  In the model of quintessino as dark matter particle, the dark matter and darkenergy are unified in one superfield, where the dynamics of the Quintessencedrives the Universe acceleration and its superpartner, quintessino, makes upthe dark matter of the Universe. This scenario predicts the existence of longlived $\tilde{\tau}$ as the next lightest supersymmetric particle. In thispaper we study the possibility of detecting $\tilde{\tau}$ produced by the highenergy cosmic neutrinos interacting with the earth matter. By a detailedcalculation we find that the event rate is one to several hundred per year at adetector with effective area of $1 km^2$. The study in this paper can be alsoapplied for models of gravitino or axino dark matter particles.

The c-quark EDM and production of $h_c$ in $e^+e^-$ annihilation

  We analyze the charm quark electric dipole moment (EDM) in the minimalsupersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), including importanttwo-loop gluino contributions. Considering the experimental constraint on theneutron EDM, the theoretical prediction for the charm quark EDM can reach about$10^{-20}e\cdot cm$. If taking into account the mixing between the scharm andstop quarks in the effective supersymmetry scenario, the charm quark EDM can beenhanced to $\sim 10^{-19}e\cdot cm$. Direct production of the CP-odd $^1P_1$state $h_c$ in $e^+e^-$ annihilation via the CP-violating process at theBES-III and CLEO-C is analyzed.

Detecting the dark matter annihilation at the ground EAS detectors

  In this paper we study the possibility of detecting gamma rays from darkmatter annihilation in the subhalos of the Milky Way by the ground based EASdetectors within the frame of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Basedon the Monte Carlo simulation we also study the properties of two specific EASdetectors, the ARGO and HAWC, and the sensitivities of these detectors on thedetection of dark matter annihilation. We find the ground EAS detectors havethe possibility to observe such signals. Conversely if no signal observed wegive the constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space, which howeverdepends on the subhalos properties.

Diffuse $γ$-rays and $\bar{p}$ flux from dark matter annihilation  -- a model for consistent results with EGRET and cosmic ray data

  In this work we develop a new propagation model for the Galactic cosmic raysbased on the GALPROP code, including contributions from dark matterannihilation. The model predicts compatible Galactic diffuse $\gamma$ rayspectra with EGRET data in all sky regions. It also gives consistent results ofthe diffuse $\gamma$ ray longitude and latitude distributions. Further theresults for B/C, $^{10}$Be/$^9$Be, proton, electron and antiproton spectra arealso consistent with cosmic ray measurements. In the model we have taken auniversal proton spectrum throughout the Galaxy without introducing largefluctuation for the proton energy loss is negligible. The dark matterannihilation signals are `boosted' after taking the contribution from subhalosinto account. Another interesting feature of the model is that it gives betterdescription of the diffuse $\gamma$ rays when taking the source distributioncompatible with supernova remnants data, which is different from previousstudies.

Big bang nucleosynthesis constrains the total annihilation cross section  of neutralino dark matter

  Assuming the lightest neutralino forms dark matter, we study its residualannihilation after freeze-out at the early universe. If taking place after thebig bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) the annihilation products, especially at thehadronic modes, may cause nonthermal nuclear reaction and change the predictionof the primordial abundance of light elements in the standard BBN scenario. Wetherefore put constraints on the neutralino annihilation cross section. Theseconstraints are free of the uncertainties of the dark matter profile todaysuffered by direct or indirect detection of dark matter. We find theconstraints by BBN is important, especially when taking large $\tan\beta$. Ifthe light element abundances can be determined with higher precision in thefuture the constraint will become very strong, so that a majority of theparameter space allowed by the relic density requirement may be excluded.

Constraining supersymmetry from the satellite experiments

  In this paper we study the detectability of $\gamma$-rays from dark matterannihilation in the subhalos of the Milky Way by the satellite-basedexperiments, EGRET and GLAST. We work in the frame of supersymmetric extensionof the standard model and assume the lightest neutralino being the dark matterparticles. Based on the N-body simulation of the evolution of dark mattersubhalos we first calculate the average intensity distribution of this newclass of $\gamma$-ray sources by neutralino annihilation. It is possible todetect these $\gamma$-ray sources by EGRET and GLAST. Conversely, if thesesources are not detected the nature of the dark matter particls will beconstrained by these experiments, which, however, depending on theuncertainties of the subhalo profile.

Mapping the dark trajectory of the Bullet Cluster

  We model the electrons/positrons produced by dark matter annihilations in thecolliding galaxy cluster system 1E0657-56 (the bullet cluster). These chargedparticles, confined by the Magnetic field, clearly trace the path of thebullet, which passes through the main cluster with a speed of 3000-5000 km/s.Adding the effect of dark matter substructure (subhalos) in each cluster wefind the annihilation rate is enhancedgreatly and the density of positrons inthe trail is similar to that within the bullet cluster. This opens the door tounambiguous detection of the annihilation signal through the SZ effect, atsignificant separation from the thermal electrons.

Implications for dark matter annihilation from the AMS-02 $\bar{p}/p$  ratio

  The AMS-02 collaboration has just released the cosmic antiproton to protonratio $\bar{p}/p$ with a high precision up to $\sim 450$ GeV. In this work, wecalculate the secondary antiprotons generated by cosmic ray interactions withthe interstellar medium taking into account the uncertainties from the cosmicray propagation. The $\bar{p}/p$ ratio predicted by these processes shows sometension with the AMS-02 data in some regions of propagation parameters, but theexcess is not significant. We then try to derive upper bounds on the darkmatter annihilation cross section from the $\bar{p}/p$ data or signal regionsfavored by the data. It is shown that the constraint derived by the AMS-02 datais similar to that from Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf galaxies. The signalregion for dark matter is usually required $m_\chi \sim O(10)$ TeV and$\left<\sigma v\right>\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-23})~\cm^3~\sec^{-1}$.

Joint Base Station Activation and Coordinated Downlink Beamforming for  HetNets: Efficient Optimal and Suboptimal Algorithms

  In cellular heterogeneous networks (HetNets), a number of distributed basestations cooperatively provide services to multiple mobile users. This paperaddresses joint base-station activation and coordinated beamforming design fordownlink transmission in HetNets. To this end, a mixed integer program isformulated to optimize the total power consumption of a HetNet. A novelapproach based on Benders' decomposition is then put forth to obtain theoptimal solution for the problem of interest with guaranteed convergence.Building on our new formulation, a dual-subgradient algorithm is also proposedto find an approximate solution in polynomial time. The proposed approaches canbe generalized to more general setups, including robust beamforming designsunder channel uncertainty, and coordinated beamforming for multi-cellscenarios.

Neutrino Splitting and Density-Dependent Dispersion Relations

  We show that particles can split only when their group velocity exceeds theirphase velocity. In this sense the splitting process is the quantum analog ofthe modulational instability in anomalous dispersive media. In the case of aneutrino whose dispersion relation contains a subdominant Lorentz-violatingcorrection of the form aP^k, the neutrino will decay into two neutrinos and anantineutrino at a rate proportional to a^3G_F^2E^{2+3k}. Unlike theCohen-Glashow instability, the splitting instability exists even if allparticles involved in the interaction have the same dispersion relations at therelevant energy scales. We show that this instability leads to strongconstraints even if the energy E is a function of both the momentum P and alsoof the background density rho, for example we show that it alone would havebeen sufficient to eliminate any model of the MINOS/OPERA velocity anomalywhich modifies the neutrino dispersion relation while leaving those of otherparticles intact.

A Light Dual-Task Neural Network for Haze Removal

  Single-image dehazing is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature.Existing methods rely on a suboptimal two-step approach, where an intermediateproduct like a depth map is estimated, based on which the haze-free image issubsequently generated using an artificial prior formula. In this paper, wepropose a light dual-task Neural Network called LDTNet that restores thehaze-free image in one shot. We use transmission map estimation as an auxiliarytask to assist the main task, haze removal, in feature extraction and toenhance the generalization of the network. In LDTNet, the haze-free image andthe transmission map are produced simultaneously. As a result, the artificialprior is reduced to the smallest extent. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatour algorithm achieves superior performance against the state-of-the-artmethods on both synthetic and real-world images.

Lepton Flavor Violation in the SUSY-GUT Models with Lopsided Mass Matrix

  The tiny neutrino masses measured in the neutrino oscillation experiments canbe naturally explained by the supersymmetric see-saw mechanism. If thesupersymmetry breaking is mediated by gravity, the see-saw models may predictobservable lepton flavor violating effects. In this work, we investigate thelepton flavor violating process $\mu\to e\gamma$ in the kind of neutrino massmodels based on the idea of the ``lopsided'' form of the charged lepton massmatrix. The constraints set by the muon anomalous magnetic moment are takeninto account. We find the present models generally predict a much largerbranching ratio of $\mu\to e\gamma$ than the experimental limit. Conversely,this process may give strong constraint on the lepton flavor structure.Following this constraint we then find a new kind of the charged lepton massmatrix. The feature of the structure is that both the elements between the 2-3and 1-3 generations are ``lopsided''. This structure produces a very small 1-3mixing and a large 1-2 mixing in the charged lepton sector, which naturallyleads to small $Br(\mu\to e\gamma)$ and the LMA solution for the solar neutrinoproblem.

Double sneutrino inflation and its phenomenologies

  In this paper we study double scalar neutrino inflation in the minimalsupersymmetric seesaw model in light of WMAP. Inflation in this model isfirstly driven by the heavier sneutrino field $\tilde{N}_2$ and then thelighter field $\tilde{N}_1$. we will show that with the mass ratio $6\lesssimM_2/M_1 \lesssim 10$ the model predicts a suppressed primordial scalar spectrumaround the largest scales and the predicted CMB TT quadrupole is much bettersuppressed than the single sneutrino model. So this model is more favored thanthe single sneutrino inflation model. We then consider the implications of themodel on the reheating temperature, leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation.Our results show that the seesaw parameters are constrained strongly by thereheating temperature, together with the requirement by a successful inflation.The mixing between the first generation and the other two generations in theright-handed neutrino sector is tiny. The rates of lepton flavor violatingprocesses in our scenario depend on only 4 unknown seesaw parameters through a'reduced' seesaw formula, besides $U_{e3}$ and the supersymmetric parameters.We find that the branching ratio of $\mu \to e \gamma$ is generally near thepresent experimental limit, while ${\rm Br}(\tau \to \mu \gamma)$ is around$\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} - 10^{-9})$.

Non-Thermal Production of WIMPs, Cosmic $e^\pm$ Excesses and  $γ$-rays from the Galactic Center

  In this paper we propose a dark matter model and study aspects of itsphenomenology. Our model is based on a new dark matter sector with a U(1)'gauge symmetry plus a discrete symmetry added to the Standard Model of particlephysics. The new fields of the dark matter sector have no hadronic charges andcouple only to leptons. Our model can not only give rise to the observedneutrino mass hierarchy, but can also generate the baryon number asymmetry vianon-thermal leptogenesis. The breaking of the new U(1)' symmetry producescosmic strings. The dark matter particles are produced non-thermally fromcosmic string loop decay which allows one to obtain sufficiently largeannihilation cross sections to explain the observed cosmic ray positron andelectron fluxes recently measured by the PAMELA, ATIC, PPB-BETS, Fermi-LAT, andHESS experiments while maintaining the required overall dark matter energydensity. The high velocity of the dark matter particles from cosmic string loopdecay leads to a low phase space density and thus to a dark matter profile witha constant density core in contrast to what happens in a scenario withthermally produced cold dark matter where the density keeps rising towards thecenter. As a result, the flux of gamma rays radiated from the final leptonicstates of dark matter annihilation from the Galactic center is suppressed andsatisfies the constraints from the HESS gamma-ray observations.

Pragmatic Physical Layer Encryption for Achieving Perfect Secrecy

  Conventionally, secrecy is achieved using cryptographic techniques beyond thephysical layer. Recent studies raise the interest of performing encryptionwithin the physical layer by exploiting some unique features of the physicalwireless channel. Following this spirit, we present a novel physical layerencryption (PLE) scheme that randomizes the radio signal using a secret keyextracted from the wireless channel under the assumption of channelreciprocity. Specifically, we propose to jointly design the encryption functionand the secret-key generation method. On one hand, we establish a sufficientand necessary condition for the encryption function to achieve perfect secrecy.Based on that, several candidate encryption functions are proposed andcompared. We show that, given the secret key available to the legitimate users,perfect secrecy can be achieved without compromising the capability of thecommunication channel. On the other hand, we study the practical design of thesecret-key generation method based on the channel reciprocity. We show that, byintroducing marginal system overhead, the key agreement between the legitimateusers can be done with a high success probability. The performance advantagesof the proposed PLE method is verified through comparisons against otherexisting PLE methods.

Quantitative study of the AMS-02 electron/positron spectra: implications  for the pulsar and dark matter properties

  The AMS-02 has just published the unprecedentedly precise measurement of thecosmic electron and positron spectra. In this paper we try to give aquantitative study on the AMS-02 results by a global fitting to the electronand positron spectra, together with the updated positron fraction data. TheMarkov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is adopted to do the fitting. The primaryelectron spectrum and the parameters for pulsars or dark matter whichcontribute extra positrons are determined simultaneously. We find that there isa hardening of the primary electron spectrum at $\sim 60$ GeV. With such a newfeature at the background spectrum both the pulsars and dark matter can explainthe AMS-02 results very well. The dark matter scenario shows a drop at positronfraction at $\sim 300$ GeV, however, suffers very strong constraints from Fermi$\gamma$-ray observations. The fitting results also suggest that thepropagation model with convection may be more favored by the lepton data thanthe reacceleration model.

Dark matter annihilation and non-thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect: I.  galaxy cluster

  In this work we calculate the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect due to the$e^+e^-$ from dark matter (DM) annihilation in galaxy clusters. Two candidatesof DM particle, (1) the weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) and (2) thelight dark matter (LDM) are investigated. For each case, we also considerseveral DM profiles with and without central cusp. We generally find smallersignals than previously reported. Moreover, the diffusion of electrons andpositrons in the galaxy clusters, which was generally thought to be negligible,is considered and found to have significant effect on the centralelectron/positron distribution for DM profile with large spatial gradient. Wefind that the SZ effect from WIMP is almost always non-observable, even for thehighly cuspy DM profile, and using the next generation SZ interferometer suchas ALMA. Although the signal of the LDM is much larger than that of the WIMP,the final SZ effect is still very small due to the smoothing effect ofdiffusion. Only for the configuration with large central cusp and extremelysmall diffusion effect, the LDM induced SZ effect might have a bit chance ofbeing detected.

A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Study on Dark Matter Property Related to the  Cosmic e$^{\pm}$ Excesses

  In this paper we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to study the darkmatter properties in interpreting the recent observations of cosmic rayelectron/positron excesses. We assume that the dark matter particles coupledominantly to leptons and consider two cases separately with annihilating ordecaying into lepton pairs. The constraint on the central density profile fromdiffuse $\gamma$-rays around the Galactic center is also included in the MarkovChain Monte Carlo code self-consistently. In the numerical study, 7 parametersare introduced. We fit two data sets independently and find that for the Dataset I (PAMELA+ATIC), dark matter with $m_{\chi}\approx0.7$ TeV for annihilation(or 1.4 TeV for decay) and pure $e^+e^-$ channel is favored, while for the Dataset II (PAMELA+Fermi-LAT+H.E.S.S.) $m_{\chi}\approx 2$ TeV for annihilation (or4 TeV for decay) and the combination of $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ finalstates can best fit the data. The H.E.S.S. observation of the Galactic center$\gamma$-rays puts a strong constraint on the central density profile of thedark matter halo for the annihilation dark matter scenario. In this case theNFW profile which is regarded as the typical predication from the cold darkmatter scenario, is excluded with a high significance ($>5\sigma$). For thedecaying dark matter scenario, the constraint is much weaker.

Neutrino emission from dark matter annihilation/decay in light of cosmic  $e^{\pm}$ and $\bar{p}$ data

  A self-consistent global fitting method based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlotechnique to study the dark matter (DM) property associated with the cosmic rayelectron/positron excesses was developed in our previous work. In this work wefurther improve the previous study to include the hadronic branching ratio ofDM annihilation/decay. The PAMELA $\bar{p}/p$ data are employed to constrainthe hadronic branching ratio. We find that the 95% ($2\sigma$) upper limits ofthe quark branching ratio allowed by the PAMELA $\bar{p}/p$ data is $\sim0.032$ for DM annihilation and $\sim 0.044$ for DM decay respectively. Thisresult shows that the DM coupling to pure leptons is indeed favored by thecurrent data. Based on the global fitting results, we further study theneutrino emission from DM in the Galactic center. Our predicted neutrino fluxis some smaller than previous works since the constraint from $\gamma$-rays isinvolved. However, it is still capable to be detected by the forth-comingneutrino detector such as IceCube. The improved points of the present studycompared with previous works include: 1) the DM parameters, both the particlephysical ones and astrophysical ones, are derived in a global fitting way, 2)constraints from various species of data sets, including $\gamma$-rays andantiprotons are included, and 3) the expectation of neutrino emission is fullyself-consistent.

A study on the sharp knee and fine structures of cosmic ray spectra

  The paper investigates the overall and detailed features of cosmic ray (CR)spectra in the knee region using the scenario of nuclei-photon interactionsaround the acceleration sources. Young supernova remnants can be the physicalrealities of such kind of CR acceleration sites. The results show that themodel can well explain the following problems simultaneously with one set ofsource parameters: the knee of CR spectra and the sharpness of the knee, thedetailed irregular structures of CR spectra, the so-called "component B" ofGalactic CRs, and the electron/positron excesses reported by recentobservations. The coherent explanation serves as evidence that at least aportion of CRs might be accelerated at the sources similar to young supernovaremnants, and one set of source parameters indicates that this portion mainlycomes from standard sources or from a single source.

Dark matter annihilation and non-thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect: II.  dwarf spheroidal galaxy

  We calculate the CMB temperature distortion due to the energetic electronsand positrons produced by dark matter annihilation (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect),in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). In the calculation we have included twoimportant effects which were previously ignored. First we show that theelectron-positron pairs with energy less than GeV, which were neglected inprevious calculation, could contribute a significant fraction of the totalsignal. Secondly we also consider the full effects of diffusion loss, whichcould significantly reduce the density of electron-positron pairs at the centerof cuspy halos. For neutralinos, we confirm that detecting such kind of SZeffect is beyond the capability of the current or even the next generationexperiments. In the case of light dark matter (LDM) the signal is much larger,but even in this case it is only marginally detectable with the next generationof experiment such as ALMA. We conclude that similar to the case of galaxyclusters, in the dwarf galaxies the $SZ_2DM}$ effect is not a strong probe ofDM annihilations.

Leptonic dark matter annihilation in the evolving universe: constraints  and implications

  The cosmic electron and positron excesses have been explained as possibledark matter (DM) annihilation products. In this work we investigate thepossible effects of such a DM annihilation scenario during the evolutionhistory of the Universe. We first calculate the extragalactic $\gamma$-raybackground (EGRB), which is produced through the final state radiation of DMannihilation to charged leptons and the inverse Compton scattering betweenelectrons/positrons and the cosmic microwave background. The DM halo profileand the minimal halo mass, which are not yet well determined from the currentN-body simulations, are constrained by the EGRB data from EGRET and Fermitelescopes. Then we discuss the impact of such leptonic DM models on cosmicevolution, such as the reionization and heating of intergalactic medium,neutral Hydrogen 21 cm signal and suppression of structure formation. We showthat the impact on the Hydrogen 21 cm signal might show interesting signaturesof DM annihilation, but the influence on star formation is not remarkable.Future observations of the 21 cm signals could be used to place new constraintson the properties of DM.

Modeling the Multi-Wavelength Emission of Shell-Type Supernova Remnant  RX J1713.7-3946

  Emission mechanisms of the shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946are studied with multi-wavelength observational data from radio, X-ray, GeV$\gamma$-ray to TeV $\gamma$-ray band. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method isemployed to explore the high-dimensional model parameter space systematically.Three scenarios for the $\gamma$-ray emission are investigated: the leptonic,the hadronic and a hybrid one. Thermal emission from the background plasma isalso included to constrain the gas density, assuming ionization equilibrium,and a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of about 0.03 cm$^{-3}$ is obtained as far asthermal energies account for a significant fraction of the dissipated kineticenergy of the SNR shock. Although systematic errors dominate the $\chi^2$ ofthe spectral fit of all models, we find that 1) the leptonic model has the bestconstrained model parameters, whose values can be easily accommodated with atypical supernova, but gives relatively poor fit to the TeV $\gamma$-ray data;2) The hybrid scenario has one more parameter than the leptonic one andimproves the overall spectral fit significantly; 3) The hadronic one, which hasthree more parameters than the leptonic model, gives the best fit to theoverall spectrum with relatively not-well-constrained model parameters and veryhard spectra of accelerated particles. The uncertainties of the modelparameters decrease significantly if the spectral indices of acceleratedelectrons and protons are the same. The hybrid and hadronic models also requirean energy input into high-energy protons, which seems to be too high comparedwith typical values of a supernova explosion. Further investigations arerequired to reconcile these observations with SNR theories.
