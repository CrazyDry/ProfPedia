The Steep Road to Happily Ever After: An Analysis of Current Visual  Storytelling Models

  Visual storytelling is an intriguing and complex task that only recentlyentered the research arena. In this work, we survey relevant work to date, andconduct a thorough error analysis of three very recent approaches to visualstorytelling. We categorize and provide examples of common types of errors, andidentify key shortcomings in current work. Finally, we make recommendations foraddressing these limitations in the future.

#SarcasmDetection is soooo general! Towards a Domain-Independent  Approach for Detecting Sarcasm

  Automatic sarcasm detection methods have traditionally been designed formaximum performance on a specific domain. This poses challenges for thosewishing to transfer those approaches to other existing or novel domains, whichmay be typified by very different language characteristics. We develop ageneral set of features and evaluate it under different training scenariosutilizing in-domain and/or out-of-domain training data. The best-performingscenario, training on both while employing a domain adaptation step, achievesan F1 of 0.780, which is well above baseline F1-measures of 0.515 and 0.345. Wealso show that the approach outperforms the best results from prior work on thesame target domain.

AI Meets Austen: Towards Human-Robot Discussions of Literary Metaphor

  Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing formal education, fueled byinnovations in learning assessment, content generation, and instructionaldelivery. Informal, lifelong learning settings have been the subject of lessattention. We provide a proof-of-concept for an embodied book discussioncompanion, designed to stimulate conversations with readers about particularlycreative metaphors in fiction literature. We collect ratings from 26participants, each of whom discuss Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" with therobot across one or more sessions, and find that participants rate theirinteractions highly. This suggests that companion robots could be aninteresting entryway for the promotion of lifelong learning and cognitiveexercise in future applications.
