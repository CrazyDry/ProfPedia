Statistical Verification of Computational Rapport Model

  Rapport plays an important role during communication because it can helppeople understand each other's feelings or ideas and leads to a smoothcommunication. Computational rapport model has been proposed based on theory inprevious work. But there lacks solid verification. In this paper, we applystructural equation model (SEM) to the theoretical model on both dyads offriend and stranger. The results indicate some unfavorable paths. Based on theresults and more literature, we modify the original model to integrate morenonverbal behaviors, including gaze and smile. Fit indices and otherexamination show the goodness of our new models, which can give us more insightinto rapport management during conversation.

Leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Recognition of  Social Norm Violation in Dialog

  Social norms are shared rules that govern and facilitate social interaction.Violating such social norms via teasing and insults may serve to upend powerimbalances or, on the contrary reinforce solidarity and rapport inconversation, rapport which is highly situated and context-dependent. In thiswork, we investigate the task of automatically identifying the phenomena ofsocial norm violation in discourse. Towards this goal, we leverage the power ofrecurrent neural networks and multimodal information present in theinteraction, and propose a predictive model to recognize social norm violation.Using long-term temporal and contextual information, our model achieves an F1score of 0.705. Implications of our work regarding developing a social-awareagent are discussed.

A New Theoretical Framework for Curiosity for Learning in Social  Contexts

  Curiosity is a vital metacognitive skill in educational contexts. Yet, littleis known about how social factors influence curiosity in group work. We arguethat curiosity is evoked not only through individual, but also interpersonalactivities, and present what we believe to be the first theoretical frameworkthat articulates an integrated socio-cognitive account of curiosity based onliterature spanning psychology, learning sciences and group dynamics, alongwith empirical observation of small-group science activity in an informallearning environment. We make a bipartite distinction between individual andinterpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviorsthat fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraginga longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm positivepredictive relationship of the latent variables of individual and interpersonalfunctions on curiosity, with the interpersonal functions exercising acomparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral realizations of thesefunctions are also discovered in a data-driven way. This framework is a steptowards designing learning technologies that can recognize and evoke curiosityduring learning in social contexts.

Curious Minds Wonder Alike: Studying Multimodal Behavioral Dynamics to  Design Social Scaffolding of Curiosity

  Curiosity is the strong desire to learn or know more about something orsomeone. Since learning is often a social endeavor, social dynamics incollaborative learning may inevitably influence curiosity. There is a scarcityof research, however, focusing on how curiosity can be evoked in group learningcontexts. Inspired by a recently proposed theoretical framework thatarticulates an integrated socio-cognitive infrastructure of curiosity, in thiswork, we use data-driven approaches to identify fine-grained social scaffoldingof curiosity in child-child interaction, and propose how they can be used toelicit and maintain curiosity in technology-enhanced learning environments. Forexample, we discovered sequential patterns of multimodal behaviors across groupmembers and we describe those that maximize an individual's utility, orlikelihood, of demonstrating curiosity during open-ended problem-solving ingroup work. We also discovered, and describe here, behaviors that directly orin a mediated manner cause curiosity related conversational behaviors in theinteraction, with twice as many interpersonal causal influences compared tointrapersonal ones. We explain how these findings form a solid foundation fordeveloping curiosity-increasing learning technologies or even assisting a humancoach to induce curiosity among learners.
