A Coordinated MDP Approach to Multi-Agent Planning for Resource  Allocation, with Applications to Healthcare

  This paper considers a novel approach to scalable multiagent resourceallocation in dynamic settings. We propose an approximate solution in whicheach resource consumer is represented by an independent MDP-based agent thatmodels expected utility using an average model of its expected access toresources given only limited information about all other agents. A globalauction-based mechanism is proposed for allocations based on expected regret.We assume truthful bidding and a cooperative coordination mechanism, as we areconsidering healthcare scenarios. We illustrate the performance of ourcoordinated MDP approach against a Monte-Carlo based planning algorithmintended for large-scale applications, as well as other approaches suitable forallocating medical resources. The evaluations show that the global utilityvalue across all consumer agents is closer to optimal when using our algorithmsunder certain time constraints, with low computational cost. As such, we offera promising approach for addressing complex resource allocation problems thatarise in healthcare settings.

Random Serial Dictatorship versus Probabilistic Serial Rule: A Tale of  Two Random Mechanisms

  For assignment problems where agents, specifying ordinal preferences, areallocated indivisible objects, two widely studied randomized mechanisms are theRandom Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). These twomechanisms both have desirable economic and computational properties, but theoutcomes they induce can be incomparable in many instances, thus creatingchallenges in deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper wefirst look at the space of lexicographic preferences and show that, as opposedto the general preference domain, RSD satisfies envyfreeness. Moreover, we showthat although under lexicographic preferences PS is strategyproof when thenumber of objects is less than or equal agents, it is strictly manipulable whenthere are more objects than agents. In the space of general preferences, weprovide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS, analyzeeconomic properties, and provide further insights on the applicability of eachmechanism in different application domains.

Strategyproof Quota Mechanisms for Multiple Assignment Problems

  We study the problem of allocating multiple objects to agents withouttransferable utilities, where each agent may receive more than one objectaccording to a quota. Under lexicographic preferences, we characterize the setof strategyproof, non-bossy, and neutral quota mechanisms and show that under amild Pareto efficiency condition, serial dictatorship quota mechanisms are theonly mechanisms satisfying these properties. Dropping the neutralityrequirement, this class of quota mechanisms further expands to sequentialdictatorship quota mechanisms. We then extend quota mechanisms to randomizedsettings, and show that the random serial dictatorship quota mechanisms (RSDQ)are envyfree, strategyproof, and ex post efficient for any number of agents andobjects and any quota system, proving that the well-studied Random SerialDictatorship (RSD) satisfies envyfreeness when preferences are lexicographic.

Investigating the Characteristics of One-Sided Matching Mechanisms Under  Various Preferences and Risk Attitudes

  One-sided matching mechanisms are fundamental for assigning a set ofindivisible objects to a set of self-interested agents when monetary transfersare not allowed. Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagentsettings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic SerialRule (PS). Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferencesand have a number of desirable economic and computational properties. However,the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus thereare challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice.In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences andprovide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS. We analyzetheir respective economic properties under general and lexicographicpreferences. We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaininginsights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanismsunder different risk-attitude models. Our results hold under various preferencedistribution models, which further confirm the broad use of RSD in mostpractical applications.

An agent-based model of an endangered population of the Arctic fox from  Mednyi Island

  Artificial Intelligence techniques such as agent-based modeling andprobabilistic reasoning have shown promise in modeling complex biologicalsystems and testing ecological hypotheses through simulation. We develop anagent-based model of Arctic foxes from Medniy Island while utilizingProbabilistic Graphical Models to capture the conditional dependencies betweenthe random variables. Such models provide valuable insights in analyzingfactors behind catastrophic degradation of this population and in revealingevolutionary mechanisms of its persistence in high-density environment. Usingempirical data from studies in Medniy Island, we create a realistic model ofArctic foxes as agents, and study their survival and population dynamics undera variety of conditions.

Convexity of Chebyshev Sets Through Differentiability of Distance  Function

  In this paper, we study a part of approximation theory that presents theconditions under which a \Ceby\sev set in a Banach space is convex. To do so,we use Gateaux differentiability of the distance function.

Characterization and Computation of Equilibria for Indivisible Goods

  We consider the problem of allocating indivisible goods in a way that isfair, using one of the leading market mechanisms in economics: the competitiveequilibrium from equal incomes. Focusing on two major classes of valuations,namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, we establish thecomputational properties of algorithms operating in this framework. For theclass of valuations with perfect complements, our algorithm yields asurprisingly succinct characterization of instances that admit a competitiveequilibrium from equal incomes.

Center vortex model and the G(2) gauge group

  The thick center vortex model is applied to G(2) gauge group to obtain thepotentials between static sources of the fundamental and adjointrepresentations. The group G(2) has only one trivial center element andtherefore it does not have any vortices which are defined based on non trivialcenter elements. To obtain the potential from the thick center vortex model,the idea of the vacuum domain structure is used. The intermediate stringtensions from this model are in rough agreement with the G(2) lattice resultsand the Casimir ratio. We argue that the SU(3) subgroup of G(2) may beresponsible for the linear potential at the intermediate distances.

Confinement in G(2) Gauge Theories Using Thick Center Vortex Model and  domain structures

  The thick center vortex model with the idea of using domain structures isused to calculate the potentials between two G(2) heavy sources in thefundamental, the adjoint and the 27 dimensional representations. The potentialsare screened at large distances. This behavior is expected from the thickcenter vortex model since G(2) has only a trivial center element which makes nocontribution to the average Wilson loop at the large distance regime. A linearpotential is obtained at intermediate distances for all representations. Thisbehavior can be explained by the thickness of the vortices (domains) and bydefining a flux for the trivial center element of G(2). The role of the SU(3)subgroup of G(2) in the linear regime is also discussed. The string tensionsare in rough agreement with the Casimir operators of the correspondingrepresentations.

A Recursive Least Square Method for 3D Pose Graph Optimization Problem

  Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) is an important non-convex optimization problemand is the state-of-the-art formulation for SLAM in robotics. It also hasapplications like camera motion estimation, structure from motion and 3Dreconstruction in machine vision. Recent researches have shown the importanceof good initialization to bootstrap well-known iterative PGO solvers toconverge to good solutions. The state-of-the-art initialization methods,however, works in low noise or eventually moderate noise problems, and theyfail in challenging problems with high measurement noise. Consequently,iterative methods may get entangled in local minima in high noise scenarios. Inthis paper we present an initialization method which uses orientationmeasurements and then present a convergence analysis of our iterativealgorithm. We show how the algorithm converges to global optima in noise-freecases and also obtain a bound for the difference between our result and theoptimum solution in scenarios with noisy measurements. We then present oursecond algorithm that uses both relative orientation and position measurementsto obtain a more accurate least squares approximation of the problem that isagain solved iteratively. In the convergence proof, a structural coefficientarises that has important influence on the basin of convergence. Interestingly,simulation results show that this coefficient also affects the performance ofother solvers and so it can indicate the complexity of the problem.Experimental results show the excellent performance of the proposedinitialization algorithm, specially in high noise scenarios.
