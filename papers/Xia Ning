A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to the Complex Sharma-Tasso-Olver Equation on  the Half Line

  In this paper, we use the Fokas method to analyze the complexSharma-Tasso-Olver(cSTO) equation on the half line. We show that it can berepresented in terms of the solution of a matrix RHP formulated in the plane ofthe complex spectral parameter {\lambda}.

A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to the Kundu-Eckhaus Equation on the  half-Line

  In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem of theKundu-Eckhaus equation on the half-line by using of the Fokas unified transformmethod. Assuming that the solution $u(x,t)$ exists, we show that it can beexpressed in terms of the unique solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problemformulated in the plane of the complex spectral parameter $\lambda$. Moreover,we also get there exist spectral functions are not independent and they aresatisfying the so-called global relation.

The initial-boundary value problems for the coupled derivative nonlinear  Schr√∂dinger equations on the half-line

  The unified transform method is used to analyze the initial-boundary valueproblem for the coupled derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger(CDNLS) equations onthe half-line. In this paper, we assume that the solution $u(x,t)$ and $v(x,t)$of CDNLS equations are exists, and we show that it can be expressed in terms ofthe unique solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the planeof the complex spectral parameter $\lambda$.

Drug Recommendation toward Safe Polypharmacy

  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) induced from high-order drug-drug interactions(DDIs) due to polypharmacy represent a significant public health problem. Inthis paper, we formally formulate the to-avoid and safe (with respect to ADRs)drug recommendation problems when multiple drugs have been takensimultaneously. We develop a joint model with a recommendation component and anADR label prediction component to recommend for a prescription a set ofto-avoid drugs that will induce ADRs if taken together with the prescription.We also develop real drug-drug interaction datasets and correspondingevaluation protocols. Our experimental results on real datasets demonstrate thestrong performance of the joint model compared to other baseline methods.

Non-local spin valve interferometer: Observation of superconducting spin  current and Aharonov-Anandan's non-adiabatic geometric phase

  An electron interferometer was designed and fabricated via a normalmetal/insulator/ferromagnet non-local lateral spin valve with a ring-shapednormal metal/insulator spacer, and spin current interference was observed. Avery high spin signal of 200 m$\Omega$ was found in a device with 2 $\mu$minjector-detector distance and magnetic field swept parallel to the plane. Witha perpendicular magnetic field sweep, a Hanle effect measurement showed bothspin precession and $h/e$ oscillation. Because of the non-adiabatic nature ofthe precessing spins at low fields as they traverse the normal metal ring, thisis an experimental observation of Aharonov-Anandan's non-adiabatic geometricphase. In addition, our observation of identical spin resistance for normal andsuperconducting Aluminum is inconsistent with theoretical predictions based onthe quasiparticle picture. To explain the superconducting spin current wesuggest that spin triplet Cooper pairs may exist in thin films of Aluminum fordirect spin injection.

Outage Performance of AF-based Time Division Broadcasting Protocol in  the Presence of Co-channel Interference

  In this paper, we investigate the outage performance of time divisionbroadcasting (TDBC) protocol in independent but non-identical Rayleighflat-fading channels, where all nodes are interfered by a finite number ofco-channel interferers. We assume that the relay operates in theamplified-and-forward mode. A tight lower bound as well as the asymptoticexpression of the outage probability is obtained in closed-form. Through boththeoretic analyses and simulation results, we show that the achievablediversity of TDBC protocol is zero in the interference-limited scenario.Moreover, we study the impacts of interference power, number of interferers andrelay placement on the outage probability. Finally, the correctness of ouranalytic results is validated via computer simulations.

A simple and efficient profile likelihood for semiparametric exponential  family

  Semiparametric exponential family proposed by Ning et al. (2017) is anextension of the parametric exponential family to the case with a nonparametricbase measure function. Such a distribution family has potential application insome areas such as high dimensional data analysis. However, the methodology forachieving the semiparametric efficiency has not been proposed in the existingliterature. In this paper, we propose a profile likelihood to efficientlyestimate both parameter and nonparametric function. Due to the use of the leastfavorable curve in the procedure of profile likelihood, the semiparametricefficiency is achieved successfully and the estimation bias is reducedsignificantly. Moreover, by making the most of the structure information of thesemiparametric exponential family, the estimator of the least favorable curvehas an explicit expression. It ensures that the newly proposed profilelikelihood can be implemented and is computationally simple. Simulation studiescan illustrate that our proposal is much better than the existing methodologyfor most cases under study, and is robust to the different model conditions.

Long short-term memory networks in memristor crossbars

  Recent breakthroughs in recurrent deep neural networks with long short-termmemory (LSTM) units has led to major advances in artificial intelligence.State-of-the-art LSTM models with significantly increased complexity and alarge number of parameters, however, have a bottleneck in computing powerresulting from limited memory capacity and data communication bandwidth. Herewe demonstrate experimentally that LSTM can be implemented with a memristorcrossbar, which has a small circuit footprint to store a large number ofparameters and in-memory computing capability that circumvents the 'von Neumannbottleneck'. We illustrate the capability of our system by solving real-worldproblems in regression and classification, which shows that memristor LSTM is apromising low-power and low-latency hardware platform for edge inference.

Discriminative Relational Topic Models

  Many scientific and engineering fields involve analyzing network data. Fordocument networks, relational topic models (RTMs) provide a probabilisticgenerative process to describe both the link structure and document contents,and they have shown promise on predicting network structures and discoveringlatent topic representations. However, existing RTMs have limitations in boththe restricted model expressiveness and incapability of dealing with imbalancednetwork data. To expand the scope and improve the inference accuracy of RTMs,this paper presents three extensions: 1) unlike the common link likelihood witha diagonal weight matrix that allows the-same-topic interactions only, wegeneralize it to use a full weight matrix that captures all pairwise topicinteractions and is applicable to asymmetric networks; 2) instead of doingstandard Bayesian inference, we perform regularized Bayesian inference(RegBayes) with a regularization parameter to deal with the imbalanced linkstructure issue in common real networks and improve the discriminative abilityof learned latent representations; and 3) instead of doing variationalapproximation with strict mean-field assumptions, we present collapsed Gibbssampling algorithms for the generalized relational topic models by exploringdata augmentation without making restricting assumptions. Under the genericRegBayes framework, we carefully investigate two popular discriminative lossfunctions, namely, the logistic log-loss and the max-margin hinge loss.Experimental results on several real network datasets demonstrate thesignificance of these extensions on improving the prediction performance, andthe time efficiency can be dramatically improved with a simple fastapproximation method.

Steerable sound transport in a 3D acoustic network

  Quasi-lossless and asymmetric sound transports, which are exceedinglydesirable in various modern physical systems, are almost based on nonlinear orangular-momentum biasing effects with extremely high power levels and complexmodulation schemes. A practical route for the steerable sound transport alongany arbitrary acoustic pathway, especially in a 3D acoustic network, couldrevolutionize the sound power flow and the sound communication. Here, we designan acoustic device consisting of a regular-tetrahedral cavity with fourcylindrical waveguides. A smaller regular-tetrahedral solid in this cavity iseccentrically emplaced to break its spatial symmetry. The numerical andexperimental results show that the sound power flow can unimpededly transportbetween two waveguides away from the eccentric solid within a wide frequencyrange. Furthermore, in the vicinity of eigenmode, the sound waves from variouswaveguides can transport to different waveguides, respectively along thecompressed and broadened pathways without mutually interference. Endowed withthese quasi-lossless and asymmetric transport characteristics, we construct a3D acoustic network, in which the sound power flow can flexibly propagate alongarbitrary sound pathways defined by our acoustic devices witheccentrically-emplaced regular-tetrahedral solids.

Dark matter direct search sensitivity of the PandaX-4T experiment

  The PandaX-4T experiment, a four-ton scale dark matter direct detectionexperiment, is being planned at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. Inthis paper we present a simulation study of the expected background in thisexperiment. In a 2.8-ton fiducial mass and the signal region between 1 to 10keV electron equivalent energy, the total electron recoil background is foundto be 4.9x10^{-5} /(kg day keV). The nuclear recoil background in the sameregion is 2.8x10^{-7}/(kg day keV). With an exposure of 5.6 ton-years, thesensitivity of PandaX-4T could reach a minimum spin-independent darkmatter-nucleon cross section of 6x10^{-48} cm^{2} at a dark matter mass of 40GeV/c^{2}.

PandaX-II Constraints on Spin-Dependent WIMP-Nucleon Effective  Interactions

  We present PandaX-II constraints on candidate WIMP-nucleon effectiveinteractions involving the nucleon or WIMP spin, including, in addition tostandard axial spin-dependent (SD) scattering, various couplings among vectorand axial currents, magnetic and electric dipole moments, and tensorinteractions. The data set corresponding to a total exposure of 54-ton-days isreanalyzed to determine constraints as a function of the WIMP mass and isospincoupling. We obtain WIMP-nucleon cross section bounds of $\rm 1.6 \times10^{-41} cm^2$ and $\rm 9.0 \times 10^{-42} cm^2$ ($90\%$ c.l.) forneutron-only SD and tensor coupling, respectively, for a mass $M_\mathrm{WIMP}\sim {\rm 40~GeV}/c^2$. The SD limits are the best currently available for$M_\mathrm{WIMP} > {\rm 40~GeV}/c^2$. We show that PandaX-II has reached asensitivity sufficient to probe a variety of other candidate spin-dependentinteractions at the weak scale.

The high-speed after pulse measurement system for PMT

  A system employing a desktop FADC has been developed to investigate thefeatures of 8 inches Hamamatsu PMT. The system stands out for its high-speedand informative results as a consequence of adopting fast waveform samplingtechnology. Recording full waveforms allows us to perform digital signalprocessing, pulse shape analysis, and precision timing extraction. Highprecision after pulse time and charge distribution characteristics arepresented in this manuscript. Other photomultipliers characteristics, such asdark rate and transit time spread, can also be obtained by exploiting waveformanalysis using this system.

Trust from the past: Bayesian Personalized Ranking based Link Prediction  in Knowledge Graphs

  Link prediction, or predicting the likelihood of a link in a knowledge graphbased on its existing state is a key research task. It differs from atraditional link prediction task in that the links in a knowledge graph arecategorized into different predicates and the link prediction performance ofdifferent predicates in a knowledge graph generally varies widely. In thiswork, we propose a latent feature embedding based link prediction model whichconsiders the prediction task for each predicate disjointly. To learn the modelparameters it utilizes a Bayesian personalized ranking based optimizationtechnique. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge bases such as YAGO2show that our link prediction approach achieves substantially higherperformance than several state-of-art approaches. We also show that for a givenpredicate the topological properties of the knowledge graph induced by thegiven predicate edges are key indicators of the link prediction performance ofthat predicate in the knowledge graph.

Induced robust topological order on an ordinary insulator  hetero-structured with a strong topological insulator

  Topological states of matter originate from distinct topological electronicstructures of materials. As for strong topological insulators (STIs), thetopological surface (interface) is a direct consequence of electronic structuretransition between materials categorized to different topological genus.Therefore, it is fundamentally interesting if such topological character can bemanipulated. Besides tuning the crystal field and the strength of spin-orbitalcoupling (e.g., by external strain, or chemical doping), there is currentlyrare report on topological state induced in ordinary insulators (OIs) by theheterostructure of OI/STI. Here we report the observation of a Dirac conetopological surface state (TSS) induced on the Sb2Se3 layer up to 15 nm thickin the OI/STI heterostructure, in sharp contrast with the OI/OI heterostructurewhere no sign of TSS can be observed. This is evident for an inducedtopological state in an OI by heterostructure.

Drug Selection via Joint Push and Learning to Rank

  Selecting the right drugs for the right patients is a primary goal ofprecision medicine. In this manuscript, we consider the problem of cancer drugselection in a learning-to-rank framework. We have formulated the cancer drugselection problem as to accurately predicting 1). the ranking positions ofsensitive drugs and 2). the ranking orders among sensitive drugs in cancer celllines based on their responses to cancer drugs. We have developed a newlearning-to-rank method, denoted as pLETORg , that predicts drug rankingstructures in each cell line via using drug latent vectors and cell line latentvectors. The pLETORg method learns such latent vectors through explicitlyenforcing that, in the drug ranking list of each cell line, the sensitive drugsare pushed above insensitive drugs, and meanwhile the ranking orders amongsensitive drugs are correct. Genomics information on cell lines is leveraged inlearning the latent vectors. Our experimental results on a benchmark cellline-drug response dataset demonstrate that the new pLETORg significantlyoutperforms the state-of-the-art method in prioritizing new sensitive drugs.

Conclusions: The new methods with drugco-medication based single drug similarities can accurately predict whether adrug combination is likely to induce adverse drug reactions of interest.  Keywords: drug-drug interaction prediction; drug combination similarity;co-medication; graph matching

Observation of topological edge states of sound at a momentum away from  the high-symmetry point

  Topologically protected one-way transportation of sound, mimicking thetopological properties of the condensed matter, has received greatlyattentions. Thus far, the topological phases and the topological edge states ofsound are yielded in the vicinity of the Dirac cones fixed at the highsymmetric points of the Brillouin zone. Here, we present a new type of thephononic topological insulator in the square lattice with position-variationalDirac cones along the high symmetric lines. The emergence of such Dirac cones,characterized by the vortex structure in a momentum space, is attributed to theunavoidable band crossing protected by the mirror symmetry. By rotating thesquare columns, these Dirac points are lifted and a complete band gap isinduced because of the mirror-symmetry-breaking. Along the topological domainwall between the phononic crystals (PhCs) with the distinct topological phasesstemming from the mirror symmetry inversion, we obtain a topological edge statefor the neutral scalar sound which is absence of the intrinsic polarization andis uncoupled from an external field. Within a wide rotational range of thesquare column, the topological edge state in our PhCs evolves from a gaplessone into a gapped one with a robust edge transport against cavities anddisorders. Our excellent results are promising for the exploration of the newtopological phenomena in the PhCs beyond the hexagonal lattices. Furthermore,the flexibility of the rotational square columns provides an interestingplatform for the design of tunable topological acoustic devices.

Performance Analysis of the Matrix Pair Beamformer with Matrix Mismatch

  Matrix pair beamformer (MPB) is a blind beamformer. It exploits the temporalstructure of the signal of interest (SOI) and applies generalizedeigen-decomposition to a covariance matrix pair. Unlike other blind algorithms,it only uses the second order statistics. A key assumption in the previous workis that the two matrices have the same interference statistics. However, thisassumption may be invalid in the presence of multipath propagations or certain"smart" jammers, and we call it as matrix mismatch. This paper analyzes theperformance of MPB with matrix mismatch. First, we propose a general frameworkthat covers the existing schemes. Then, we derive its normalized output SINR.It reveals that the matrix mismatch leads to a threshold effect caused by"steering vector competition". Second, using matrix perturbation theory, wefind that, if there are generalized eigenvalues that are infinite, thethreshold will increase unboundedly with the interference power. This is highlyprobable when there are multiple periodical interferers. Finally, we presentsimulation results to verify our analysis.

The study of the aging behavior on large area MCP-PMT

  Aging experiments of a novel type of large area MCP-PMT made by JUNOcollaboration were conducted.In these aging experiments, themulti-photoelectron spectrum and single photoelectron spectrum were measureddaily,as well as the MCP resistance of the second PMT before and after theexperiment. Two PMTs were aged successivelyfor cross check. The first PMT wasaged for 52 days, while the other one was aged for 84 days. In order to studythe mechanism of the aging process, the high voltage on the second PMT wasincreased to accelerate its aging process when the cumulative output of chargefrom its anode was about 4 C. From our study, it can be known that large areaMCP-PMT aging had a strong relationship with the related MCPs. In accordancewith the PMT aging curve,a PMT aging model was setup and a general agingformula was given.

Iterative Eigenvalue Decomposition and Multipath-Grouping Tx/Rx Joint  Beamforming for Millimeter-Wave Communication

  We investigate Tx/Rx joint beamforming in millimeter-wave communications(MMWC). As the multipath components (MPCs) have different steering angles andindependent fadings, beamforming aims at achieving array gain as well asdiversity gain in this scenario. A sub-optimal beamforming scheme is proposedto find the antenna weight vectors (AWVs) at Tx/Rx via iterative eigenvaluedecomposition (EVD), provided that full channel state information (CSI) isavailable at both the transmitter and receiver. To make this scheme practicallyfeasible in MMWC, a corresponding training approach is suggested to avoid thechannel estimation and iterative EVD computation. As in fast fading scenariothe training approach may be time-consuming due to frequent training, anotherbeamforming scheme, which exploits the quasi-static steering angles in MMWC, isproposed to reduce the overhead and increase the system reliability bymultipath grouping (MPG). The scheme first groups the MPCs and thenconcurrently beamforms towards multiple steering angles of the grouped MPCs, sothat both array gain and diversity gain are achieved. Performance comparisonsshow that, compared with the corresponding state-of-the-art schemes, theiterative EVD scheme with the training approach achieves the same performancewith a reduced overhead and complexity, while the MPG scheme achieves betterperformance with an approximately equivalent complexity.

Phylogenomic Analyses of Large-scale Nuclear Genes Provide New Insights  into the Evolutionary Relationships within the Rosids

  The Rosids is one of the largest groups of flowering plants, with 140families and ~70,000 species. Previous phylogenetic studies of the rosids haveprimarily utilized organelle genes that likely differ in evolutionary historiesfrom nuclear genes. To better understand the evolutionary history of rosids, itis necessary to investigate their phylogenetic relationships using nucleargenes. Here, we employed large-scale phylogenomic datasets composed of nucleargenes, including 891 clusters of putative orthologous genes. Combined withcomprehensive taxon sampling covering 63 species representing 14 out of the 17orders, we reconstructed the rosids phylogeny with coalescence andconcatenation methods, yielding similar tree topologies from all datasets.However, these topologies did not agree on the placement of Zygophyllales.Through comprehensive analyses, we found that missing data and gene treeheterogeneity were potential factors that may mislead concatenation methods, inparticular, large amounts of missing data under high gene tree heterogeneity.Our results provided new insights into the deep phylogenetic relationships ofthe rosids, and demonstrated that coalescence methods may effectively resolvethe phylogenetic relationships of the rosids with missing data under high genetree heterogeneity.

Grade Prediction with Temporal Course-wise Influence

  There is a critical need to develop new educational technology applicationsthat analyze the data collected by universities to ensure that studentsgraduate in a timely fashion (4 to 6 years); and they are well prepared forjobs in their respective fields of study. In this paper, we present a novelapproach for analyzing historical educational records from a large, publicuniversity to perform next-term grade prediction; i.e., to estimate the gradesthat a student will get in a course that he/she will enroll in the next term.Accurate next-term grade prediction holds the promise for better student degreeplanning, personalized advising and automated interventions to ensure thatstudents stay on track in their chosen degree program and graduate on time. Wepresent a factorization-based approach called Matrix Factorization withTemporal Course-wise Influence that incorporates course-wise influence effectsand temporal effects for grade prediction. In this model, students and coursesare represented in a latent "knowledge" space. The grade of a student on acourse is modeled as the similarity of their latent representation in the"knowledge" space. Course-wise influence is considered as an additional factorin the grade prediction. Our experimental results show that the proposed methodoutperforms several baseline approaches and infer meaningful patterns betweenpairs of courses within academic programs.

ALE: Additive Latent Effect Models for Grade Prediction

  The past decade has seen a growth in the development and deployment ofeducational technologies for assisting college-going students in choosingmajors, selecting courses and acquiring feedback based on past academicperformance. Grade prediction methods seek to estimate a grade that a studentmay achieve in a course that she may take in the future (e.g., next term).Accurate and timely prediction of students' academic grades is important fordeveloping effective degree planners and early warning systems, and ultimatelyimproving educational outcomes. Existing grade pre- diction methods mostlyfocus on modeling the knowledge components associated with each course andstudent, and often overlook other factors such as the difficulty of eachknowledge component, course instructors, student interest, capabilities andeffort. In this paper, we propose additive latent effect models thatincorporate these factors to predict the student next-term grades.Specifically, the proposed models take into account four factors: (i) student'sacademic level, (ii) course instructors, (iii) student global latent factor,and (iv) latent knowledge factors. We compared the new models with severalstate-of-the-art methods on students of various characteristics (e.g., whethera student transferred in or not). The experimental results demonstrate that theproposed methods significantly outperform the baselines on grade predictionproblem. Moreover, we perform a thorough analysis on the importance ofdifferent factors and how these factors can practically assist students incourse selection, and finally improve their academic performance.

Delay Outage Probability of Multi-relay Selection for Mobile Relay Edge  Computing Systems

  In this paper, we deal with the problem of relay selection in mobile edgecomputing networks, where a source node transmits a computation-intensive taskto a destination via the aid of multiple relay nodes. It differs from thetraditional relay nodes in the way that each relay node is equipped with anedge computing server, thus each relay node can execute the received task andforwards the computed result to the destination. Accordingly, we define a delayoutage probability to evaluate the impact of the relay computing ability on thelink communications, and then propose a latency-best relay selection (LBRS)scheme that not only consider the communication capability, but also considerthe computing ability. The performance of the proposed relay selection schemewith the traditional communication-only relay selection (CORS) andcomputing-only selection (CPORS) schemes in terms of the delay outageprobability and the diversity order is analyzed, compared with other relayselection schemes. We show that the proposed LBRS scheme reduces to thetraditional CORS scheme under the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. Wefurther reveal that the diversity orders of both the proposed LBRS and CORSschemes are dependent on the computing ability of relay nodes.

Deterministic entanglement swapping in a superconducting circuit

  Entanglement swapping allows two particles that have never been coupleddirectly or indirectly to be nonlocally correlated. Besides fundamentalinterest, this procedure has applications in complex entanglement manipulationand quantum communication. Entanglement swapping for qubits has beendemonstrated in optical experiments, but where the process was conditional ondetection of preset photon coincidence events, which succeeded with only asmall probability. Here we report an unconditional entanglement swappingexperiment with superconducting qubits. Using controllable qubit-qubitcouplings mediated by a resonator, we prepare two highly entangled qubit pairsand then perform the Bell state measurement on two qubits coming from differententangled pairs, projecting the remaining two qubits to one of four Bellstates. The measured concurrences for these Bell states are above0.75,demonstrating the quantum nature of entanglement swapping. With thissetup, we further demonstrate delayed-choice entanglement swapping, confirmingwhether two qubits behaved as in an entangled state or as in a separate stateis determined by a later choice of the type of measurement on their partners.This is the first demonstration of entanglement-separability duality in adeterministic way, closing the detection loophole the previous experimentssuffer from.

Introduction of the CDEX experiment

  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are the candidates of darkmatter in our universe. Up to now any direct interaction of WIMP with nucleihas not been observed yet. The exclusion limits of the spin-independent crosssection of WIMP-nucleon which have been experimentally obtained is about10^{-7}pb at high mass region and only 10^{-5}pb} at low mass region. ChinaJin-Ping underground laboratory CJPL is the deepest underground lab in theworld and provides a very promising environment for direct observation of darkmatter. The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) experiment is going to directlydetect the WIMP flux with high sensitivity in the low mass region. Both CJPLand CDEX have achieved a remarkable progress in recent two years. The CDEXemploys a point-contact germanium semi-conductor detector PCGe whose detectionthreshold is less than 300 eV. We report the measurement results of Muon flux,monitoring of radioactivity and Radon concentration carried out in CJPL, aswell describe the structure and performance of the 1 kg PCGe detector CDEX-1and 10kg detector array CDEX-10 including the detectors, electronics, shieldingand cooling systems. Finally we discuss the physics goals of the CDEX-1,CDEX-10 and the future CDEX-1T detectors.

Study of the material photon and electron background and the liquid  argon detector veto efficiency of the CDEX-10 experiment

  The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) is located at the China Jinpingunderground laboratory (CJPL) and aims to directly detect the WIMP flux withhigh sensitivity in the low mass region. Here we present a study of thepredicted photon and electron backgrounds including the background contributionof the structure materials of the germanium detector, the passive shieldingmaterials, and the intrinsic radioactivity of the liquid argon that serves asan anti-Compton active shielding detector. A detailed geometry is modeled andthe background contribution has been simulated based on the measuredradioactivities of all possible components within the GEANT4 program. Then thephoton and electron background level in the energy region of interest (<10^-2events kg-1 day-1 keV-1 (cpkkd)) is predicted based on Monte Carlo simulations.The simulated result is consistent with the design goal of CDEX-10 experiment,0.1 cpkkd, which shows that the active and passive shield design of CDEX-10 iseffective and feasible.

Spectral measurement of electron antineutrino oscillation amplitude and  frequency at Daya Bay

  A measurement of the energy dependence of antineutrino disappearance at theDaya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is reported. Electron antineutrinos($\overline{\nu}_{e}$) from six $2.9$ GW$_{\rm th}$ reactors were detected withsix detectors deployed in two near (effective baselines 512 m and 561 m) andone far (1579 m) underground experimental halls. Using 217 days of data, 41589(203809 and 92912) antineutrino candidates were detected in the far hall (nearhalls). An improved measurement of the oscillation amplitude$\sin^{2}2\theta_{13} = 0.090^{+0.008}_{-0.009} $ and the first directmeasurement of the $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ mass-squared difference $|\Deltam^{2}_{ee}|= (2.59_{-0.20}^{+0.19}) \times 10^{-3}\ {\rm eV}^2 $ is obtainedusing the observed $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ rates and energy spectra in athree-neutrino framework.  This value of $|\Delta m^{2}_{ee}|$ is consistent with $|\Deltam^{2}_{\mu\mu}|$ measured by muon neutrino disappearance, supporting thethree-flavor oscillation model.

Independent Measurement of Theta13 via Neutron Capture on Hydrogen at  Daya Bay

  A new measurement of the $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle has been obtained at theDaya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment via the detection of inverse beta decaystagged by neutron capture on hydrogen. The antineutrino events for hydrogencapture are distinct from those for gadolinium capture with largely differentsystematic uncertainties, allowing a determination independent of thegadolinium-capture result and an improvement on the precision of $\theta_{13}$measurement. With a 217-day antineutrino data set obtained with sixantineutrino detectors and from six 2.9 GW$_{th}$ reactors, the rate deficitobserved at the far hall is interpreted as $\sin^22\theta_{13}=0.083\pm0.018$in the three-flavor oscillation model. When combined with thegadolinium-capture result from Daya Bay, we obtain$\sin^22\theta_{13}=0.089\pm0.008$ as the final result for thesix-antineutrino-detector configuration of the Daya Bay experiment.

Search for a Light Sterile Neutrino at Daya Bay

  A search for light sterile neutrino mixing was performed with the first 217days of data from the Daya Bay Reactor Antineutrino Experiment. Theexperiment's unique configuration of multiple baselines from six 2.9~GW$_{\rmth}$ nuclear reactors to six antineutrino detectors deployed in two near(effective baselines 512~m and 561~m) and one far (1579~m) undergroundexperimental halls makes it possible to test for oscillations to a fourth(sterile) neutrino in the $10^{\rm -3}~{\rm eV}^{2} < |\Delta m_{41}^{2}| <0.3~{\rm eV}^{2}$ range. The relative spectral distortion due to electronantineutrino disappearance was found to be consistent with that of thethree-flavor oscillation model. The derived limits on $\sin^22\theta_{14}$cover the $10^{-3}~{\rm eV}^{2} \lesssim |\Delta m^{2}_{41}| \lesssim 0.1~{\rmeV}^{2}$ region, which was largely unexplored.

A new measurement of antineutrino oscillation with the full detector  configuration at Daya Bay

  We report a new measurement of electron antineutrino disappearance using thefully-constructed Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. The final two of eightantineutrino detectors were installed in the summer of 2012. Including the 404days of data collected from October 2012 to November 2013 resulted in a totalexposure of 6.9$\times$10$^5$ GW$_{\rm th}$-ton-days, a 3.6 times increase overour previous results. Improvements in energy calibration limited variationsbetween detectors to 0.2%. Removal of six $^{241}$Am-$^{13}$C radioactivecalibration sources reduced the background by a factor of two for the detectorsin the experimental hall furthest from the reactors. Direct prediction of theantineutrino signal in the far detectors based on the measurements in the neardetectors explicitly minimized the dependence of the measurement on models ofreactor antineutrino emission. The uncertainties in our estimates of$\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}$ and $|\Delta m^2_{ee}|$ were halved as a result of theseimprovements. Analysis of the relative antineutrino rates and energy spectrabetween detectors gave $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13} = 0.084\pm0.005$ and $|\Deltam^{2}_{ee}|= (2.42\pm0.11) \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ in the three-neutrinoframework.

Measurement of the Reactor Antineutrino Flux and Spectrum at Daya Bay

  This Letter reports a measurement of the flux and energy spectrum of electronantineutrinos from six 2.9~GW$_{th}$ nuclear reactors with six detectorsdeployed in two near (effective baselines 512~m and 561~m) and one far(1,579~m) underground experimental halls in the Daya Bay experiment. Using 217days of data, 296,721 and 41,589 inverse beta decay (IBD) candidates weredetected in the near and far halls, respectively. The measured IBD yield is(1.55 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-18}$~cm$^2$/GW/day or (5.92 $\pm$ 0.14)$\times$ 10$^{-43}$~cm$^2$/fission. This flux measurement is consistent withprevious short-baseline reactor antineutrino experiments and is $0.946\pm0.022$($0.991\pm0.023$) relative to the flux predicted with the Huber+Mueller(ILL+Vogel) fissile antineutrino model. The measured IBD positron energyspectrum deviates from both spectral predictions by more than 2$\sigma$ overthe full energy range with a local significance of up to $\sim$4$\sigma$between 4-6 MeV. A reactor antineutrino spectrum of IBD reactions is extractedfrom the measured positron energy spectrum for model-independent predictions.

New measurement of $Œ∏_{13}$ via neutron capture on hydrogen at Daya  Bay

  This article reports an improved independent measurement of neutrino mixingangle $\theta_{13}$ at the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. Electronantineutrinos were identified by inverse $\beta$-decays with the emittedneutron captured by hydrogen, yielding a data-set with principally distinctuncertainties from that with neutrons captured by gadolinium. With the finaltwo of eight antineutrino detectors installed, this study used 621 days of dataincluding the previously reported 217-day data set with six detectors. Thedominant statistical uncertainty was reduced by 49%. Intensive studies of thecosmogenic muon-induced $^9$Li and fast neutron backgrounds and theneutron-capture energy selection efficiency, resulted in a reduction of thesystematic uncertainty by 26%. The deficit in the detected number ofantineutrinos at the far detectors relative to the expected number based on thenear detectors yielded $\sin^22\theta_{13} = 0.071 \pm 0.011$ in thethree-neutrino-oscillation framework. The combination of this result with thegadolinium-capture result is also reported.

Improved Search for a Light Sterile Neutrino with the Full Configuration  of the Daya Bay Experiment

  This Letter reports an improved search for light sterile neutrino mixing inthe electron antineutrino disappearance channel with the full configuration ofthe Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. With an additional 404 days of datacollected in eight antineutrino detectors, this search benefits from 3.6 timesthe statistics available to the previous publication, as well as fromimprovements in energy calibration and background reduction. A relativecomparison of the rate and energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos in thethree experimental halls yields no evidence of sterile neutrino mixing in the$2\times10^{-4} \lesssim |\Delta m^{2}_{41}| \lesssim 0.3$ eV$^{2}$ mass range.The resulting limits on $\sin^{2}2\theta_{14}$ are improved by approximately afactor of 2 over previous results and constitute the most stringent constraintsto date in the $|\Delta m^{2}_{41}| \lesssim 0.2$ eV$^{2}$ region.

Improved Measurement of the Reactor Antineutrino Flux and Spectrum at  Daya Bay

  A new measurement of the reactor antineutrino flux and energy spectrum by theDaya Bay reactor neutrino experiment is reported. The antineutrinos weregenerated by six 2.9~GW$_{\mathrm{th}}$ nuclear reactors and detected by eightantineutrino detectors deployed in two near (560~m and 600~m flux-weightedbaselines) and one far (1640~m flux-weighted baseline) underground experimentalhalls. With 621 days of data, more than 1.2 million inverse beta decay (IBD)candidates were detected. The IBD yield in the eight detectors was measured,and the ratio of measured to predicted flux was found to be $0.946\pm0.020$($0.992\pm0.021$) for the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) model. A 2.9~$\sigma$deviation was found in the measured IBD positron energy spectrum compared tothe predictions. In particular, an excess of events in the region of 4-6~MeVwas found in the measured spectrum, with a local significance of 4.4~$\sigma$.A reactor antineutrino spectrum weighted by the IBD cross section is extractedfor model-independent predictions.

Study of the wave packet treatment of neutrino oscillation at Daya Bay

  The disappearance of reactor $\bar{\nu}_e$ observed by the Daya Bayexperiment is examined in the framework of a model in which the neutrino isdescribed by a wave packet with a relative intrinsic momentum dispersion$\sigma_\text{rel}$. Three pairs of nuclear reactors and eight antineutrinodetectors, each with good energy resolution, distributed among threeexperimental halls, supply a high-statistics sample of $\bar{\nu}_e$ acquiredat nine different baselines. This provides a unique platform to test theeffects which arise from the wave packet treatment of neutrino oscillation. Themodified survival probability formula was used to fit Daya Bay data, providingthe first experimental limits: $2.38 \cdot 10^{-17} < \sigma_{\rm rel} < 0.23$.Treating the dimensions of the reactor cores and detectors as constraints, thelimits are improved: $10^{-14} \lesssim \sigma_{\rm rel} < 0.23$, and an upperlimit of $\sigma_{\rm rel} <0.20$ is obtained. All limits correspond to a 95\%C.L. Furthermore, the effect due to the wave packet nature of neutrinooscillation is found to be insignificant for reactor antineutrinos detected bythe Daya Bay experiment thus ensuring an unbiased measurement of theoscillation parameters $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$ within theplane wave model.

Measurement of electron antineutrino oscillation based on 1230 days of  operation of the Daya Bay experiment

  A measurement of electron antineutrino oscillation by the Daya Bay ReactorNeutrino Experiment is described in detail. Six 2.9-GW$_{\rm  th}$ nuclear power reactors of the Daya Bay and Ling Ao nuclear powerfacilities served as intense sources of $\overline{\nu}_{e}$'s. Comparison ofthe $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ rate and energy spectrum measured by antineutrinodetectors far from the nuclear reactors ($\sim$1500-1950 m) relative todetectors near the reactors ($\sim$350-600 m) allowed a precise measurement of$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ disappearance. More than 2.5 million $\overline{\nu}_{e}$inverse beta decay interactions were observed, based on the combination of 217days of operation of six antineutrino detectors (Dec. 2011--Jul. 2012) with asubsequent 1013 days using the complete configuration of eight detectors (Oct.2012--Jul. 2015). The $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ rate observed at the far detectorsrelative to the near detectors showed a significant deficit, $R=0.949 \pm0.002(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.002(\mathrm{syst.})$. The energy dependence of$\overline{\nu}_{e}$ disappearance showed the distinct variation predicted byneutrino oscillation. Analysis using an approximation for the three-flavoroscillation probability yielded the flavor-mixing angle$\sin^22\theta_{13}=0.0841 \pm 0.0027(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm0.0019(\mathrm{syst.})$ and the effective neutrino mass-squared difference of$\left|{\Delta}m^2_{\mathrm{ee}}\right|=(2.50 \pm 0.06(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm0.06(\mathrm{syst.})) \times 10^{-3}\ {\rm eV}^2$. Analysis using the exactthree-flavor probability found ${\Delta}m^2_{32}=(2.45 \pm 0.06(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.06(\mathrm{syst.})) \times 10^{-3}\ {\rm eV}^2$ assuming the normalneutrino mass hierarchy and ${\Delta}m^2_{32}=(-2.56 \pm 0.06(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.06(\mathrm{syst.})) \times 10^{-3}\ {\rm eV}^2$ for the invertedhierarchy.

Measurement of the center-of-mass energies at BESIII via the di-muon  process

  From 2011 to 2014, the BESIII experiment collected about 5 fb$^{-1}$ data atcenter-of-mass energies around 4 GeV for the studies of the charmonium-like andhigher excited charmonium states. By analyzing the di-muon process$e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\gamma_{\rm ISR/FSR}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, the center-of-massenergies of the data samples are measured with a precision of 0.8 MeV. Thecenter-of-mass energy is found to be stable for most of time during the datataking.

Measurement of the branching fraction for $œà(3770) \to  Œ≥œá_{c0}$

  By analyzing a data set of 2.92 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data taken at$\sqrt s= 3.773~\rm GeV$ and 106.41$\times 10^{6}$ $\psi(3686)$ decays taken at$\sqrt s= 3.686~\rm GeV$ with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, wemeasure the branching fraction and the partial decay width for$\psi(3770)\to\gamma\chi_{c0}$ to be ${\mathcalB}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\chi_{c0})=(6.88\pm0.28\pm0.67)\times 10^{-3}$ and$\Gamma[\psi(3770)\to\gamma\chi_{c0}]=(187\pm8\pm19)~\rm keV$, respectively.These are the most precise measurements to date.

Measurements of absolute hadronic branching fractions of  $Œõ_{c}^{+}$ baryon

  Using $567\rm{pb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collisions recorded at$\sqrt{s}=4.599\rm{GeV}$ with the BESIII detector, we report first measurementsof absolute hadronic branching fractions of Cabibbo-favored decays of the$\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ baryon with a double-tag technique. A global least-squarefitter is utilized to improve the measured precision. Among the measurementsfor twelve $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ decay modes, the branching fraction for$\Lambda_{c}^{+} \rightarrow pK^-\pi^+$ is determined to be$(5.84\pm0.27\pm0.23)\%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and thesecond is systematic. In addition, the measurements of the branching fractionsof the other eleven Cabbibo-favored hadronic decay modes are significantlyimproved.

Determination of the number of $J/œà$ events with inclusive $J/œà$  decays

  A measurement of the number of $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIIIdetector in 2009 and 2012 is performed using inclusive decays of the $J/\psi$ .The number of $J/\psi$ events taken in 2009 is recalculated to be$(223.7\pm1.4)\times 10^6$, which is in good agreement with the previousmeasurement, but with significantly improved precision due to improvements inthe BESIII software. The number of $J/\psi$ events taken in 2012 is determinedto be $(1086.9\pm 6.0)\times 10^6$. In total, the number of $J/\psi$ eventscollected with the BESIII detector is measured to be $(1310.6\pm 7.0)\times10^6$, where the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects and thestatistical uncertainty is negligible.

The CDEX-1 1 kg Point-Contact Germanium Detector for Low Mass Dark  Matter Searches

  The CDEX Collaboration has been established for direct detection of lightdark matter particles, using ultra-low energy threshold p-type point-contactgermanium detectors, in China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL). The first1 kg point-contact germanium detector with a sub-keV energy threshold has beentested in a passive shielding system located in CJPL. The outputs from both thepoint-contact p+ electrode and the outside n+ electrode make it possible toscan the lower energy range of less than 1 keV and at the same time to detectthe higher energy range up to 3 MeV. The outputs from both p+ and n+ electrodemay also provide a more powerful method for signal discrimination for darkmatter experiment. Some key parameters, including energy resolution, dead time,decay times of internal X-rays, and system stability, have been tested andmeasured. The results show that the 1 kg point-contact germanium detector,together with its shielding system and electronics, can run smoothly with goodperformances. This detector system will be deployed for dark matter searchexperiments.

nEXO Pre-Conceptual Design Report

  The projected performance and detector configuration of nEXO are described inthis pre-Conceptual Design Report (pCDR). nEXO is a tonne-scale neutrinolessdouble beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay search in $^{136}$Xe, based on theultra-low background liquid xenon technology validated by EXO-200. With$\simeq$ 5000 kg of xenon enriched to 90% in the isotope 136, nEXO has aprojected half-life sensitivity of approximately $10^{28}$ years. Thisrepresents an improvement in sensitivity of about two orders of magnitude withrespect to current results. Based on the experience gained from EXO-200 and theeffectiveness of xenon purification techniques, we expect the background to bedominated by external sources of radiation. The sensitivity increase is,therefore, entirely derived from the increase of active mass in a monolithicand homogeneous detector, along with some technical advances perfected in thecourse of a dedicated R&D program. Hence the risk which is inherent to theconstruction of a large, ultra-low background detector is reduced, as theintrinsic radioactive contamination requirements are generally not beyond thosedemonstrated with the present generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments.Indeed, most of the required materials have been already assayed or reasonableestimates of their properties are at hand. The details described hereinrepresent the base design of the detector configuration as of early 2018. Wherepotential design improvements are possible, alternatives are discussed.  This design for nEXO presents a compelling path towards a next generationsearch for $0\nu\beta\beta$, with a substantial possibility to discover physicsbeyond the Standard Model.

VUV-sensitive Silicon Photomultipliers for Xenon Scintillation Light  Detection in nEXO

  Future tonne-scale liquefied noble gas detectors depend on efficient lightdetection in the VUV range. In the past years Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs)have emerged as a valid alternative to standard photomultiplier tubes or largearea avalanche photodiodes. The next generation double beta decay experiment,nEXO, with a 5 tonne liquid xenon time projection chamber, will use SiPMs fordetecting the $178\,\text{nm}$ xenon scintillation light, in order to achievean energy resolution of $\sigma / Q_{\beta\beta} = 1\, \%$. This paper presentsrecent measurements of the VUV-HD generation SiPMs from Fondazione BrunoKessler in two complementary setups. It includes measurements of the photondetection efficiency with gaseous xenon scintillation light in a vacuum setupand dark measurements in a dry nitrogen gas setup. We report improved photondetection efficiency at $175\,\text{nm}$ compared to previous generationdevices, that would meet the criteria of nEXO. Furthermore, we present theprojected nEXO detector light collection and energy resolution that could beachieved by using these SiPMs.

Imaging individual barium atoms in solid xenon for barium tagging in  nEXO

  The search for neutrinoless double beta decay probes the fundamentalproperties of neutrinos, including whether or not the neutrino and antineutrinoare distinct. Double beta detectors are large and expensive, so backgroundreduction is essential for extracting the highest sensitivity. Theidentification, or 'tagging', of the $^{136}$Ba daughter atom from double betadecay of $^{136}$Xe provides a technique for eliminating backgrounds in thenEXO neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. The tagging scheme studied inthis work utilizes a cryogenic probe to trap the barium atom in solid xenon,where the barium atom is tagged via fluorescence imaging in the solid xenonmatrix. Here we demonstrate imaging and counting of individual atoms of bariumin solid xenon by scanning a focused laser across a solid xenon matrixdeposited on a sapphire window. When the laser sits on an individual atom, thefluorescence persists for $\sim$30~s before dropping abruptly to the backgroundlevel, a clear confirmation of one-atom imaging. No barium fluorescencepersists following evaporation of a barium deposit to a limit of $\leq$0.16\%.This is the first time that single atoms have been imaged in solid nobleelement. It establishes the basic principle of a barium tagging technique fornEXO.

Study of Silicon Photomultiplier Performance in External Electric Fields

  We report on the performance of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) light sensorsoperating in electric field strength up to 30 kV/cm and at a temperature of149K, relative to their performance in the absence of an external electricfield. The SiPM devices used in this study show stable gain, photon detectionefficiency, and rates of correlated pulses, when exposed to external fields,within the estimated uncertainties. No observable physical damage to the bulkor surface of the devices was caused by the exposure.

Characterization of the Hamamatsu VUV4 MPPCs for nEXO

  In this paper we report on the characterization of the Hamamatsu VUV4 VacuumUltra-Violet (VUV) sensitive Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs) as part of thedevelopment of a solution for the detection of liquid xenon scintillation lightfor the nEXO experiment. Various SiPM features, such as: dark noise, gain,correlated avalanches, direct crosstalk and Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE)were measured in a dedicated setup at TRIUMF. SiPMs were characterized in therange $163 \text{ } \text{K} \leq \text{T}\leq 233 \text{ } \text{K}$. Wereport a PDE of $13.4\pm2.6\%$ for $189\pm 7$ nm light at a SiPM over voltageof $3.6\pm0.2\text{ V}$ and at $\text{T}=233 \text{ }\text{K}$. Withinsystematic uncertainties, this value meets nEXO requirements. At an overvoltage of $3.1\pm0.2$ V and at $\text{T}=163 \text{ }\text{K}$ the number ofCorrelated Avalanches (CAs) per pulse in the $1 \upmu\text{s}$ intervalfollowing the trigger pulse is $0.161\pm0.005$. At the same settings theDark-Noise (DN) rate is $0.137\pm0.002 \text{ Hz/mm}^{2}$. Both the number ofCAs and the DN rate are within nEXO specifications.

Search for $Œ∑$ and $Œ∑^\prime\to œÄ^+ e^- \barŒΩ_e +c.c.$  decays in $\jpsi \to œÜŒ∑$ and $œÜŒ∑^\prime$

  Using a sample of 225.3 million $\jpsi$ events collected with the BESIIIdetector at the BEPCII $e^+e^-$ collider in 2009, searches for the decays of$\eta$ and $\eta^\prime\to\pi^+ e^- \bar{\nu}_e +c.c.$ in $\jpsi \to \phi \eta$and $\phi\eta^\prime$ are performed. The $\phi$ signals, which arereconstructed in $K^+K^-$ final states, are used to tag $\eta$ and$\eta^\prime$ semileptonic decays. No signals are observed for either $\eta$ or$\eta^\prime$, and upper limits at the 90% confidence level are determined tobe $7.3\times 10^{-4}$ and $5.0\times 10^{-4}$ for the ratios $\frac{{\mathcalB}(\eta\to \pi^+ e^- \bar{\nu}_e +c.c.)}{{\mathcal B}(\eta \to \pip\pim\piz)}$and $\frac{{\mathcal B}(\eta^\prime\to \pi^+ e^-\bar{\nu}_e +c.c.)}{{\mathcalB}(\eta^\prime \to \pip\pim\eta)}$, respectively. These are the first upperlimit values determined for $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ semileptonic weak decays.
