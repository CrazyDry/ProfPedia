Fast Solutions to Projective Monotone Linear Complementarity Problems

  We present a new interior-point potential-reduction algorithm for solvingmonotone linear complementarity problems (LCPs) that have a particular specialstructure: their matrix $M\in{\mathbb R}^{n\times n}$ can be decomposed as$M=\Phi U + \Pi_0$, where the rank of $\Phi$ is $k<n$, and $\Pi_0$ denotesEuclidean projection onto the nullspace of $\Phi^\top$. We call such LCPsprojective. Our algorithm solves a monotone projective LCP to relative accuracy$\epsilon$ in $O(\sqrt n \ln(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, with each iterationrequiring $O(nk^2)$ flops. This complexity compares favorably withinterior-point algorithms for general monotone LCPs: these algorithms alsorequire $O(\sqrt n \ln(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, but each iteration needs tosolve an $n\times n$ system of linear equations, a much higher cost than ouralgorithm when $k\ll n$. Our algorithm works even though the solution to aprojective LCP is not restricted to lie in any low-rank subspace.

Galerkin Methods for Complementarity Problems and Variational  Inequalities

  Complementarity problems and variational inequalities arise in a wide varietyof areas, including machine learning, planning, game theory, and physicalsimulation. In all of these areas, to handle large-scale problem instances, weneed fast approximate solution methods. One promising idea is Galerkinapproximation, in which we search for the best answer within the span of agiven set of basis functions. Bertsekas proposed one possible Galerkin methodfor variational inequalities. However, this method can exhibit two problems inpractice: its approximation error is worse than might be expected based on theability of the basis to represent the desired solution, and each iterationrequires a projection step that is not always easy to implement efficiently.So, in this paper, we present a new Galerkin method with improved behavior: ournew error bounds depend directly on the distance from the true solution to thesubspace spanned by our basis, and the only projections we require are onto thefeasible region or onto the span of our basis.

Dust Grain-Size Distributions From MRN to MEM

  Employing the Maximum Entropy Method algorithm, we fit interstellarextinction measurements which span the wavelength range 0.125-3 micron. Wepresent a uniform set of MEM model fits, all using the same grain materials,optical constants and abundance constraints. In addition, we are takingadvantage of improved UV and IR data and better estimates of the gas-to-dustratio. The model fits cover the entire range of extinction properties that havebeen seen in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The grain models employedfor this presentation are the simplistic homogeneous spheres models (i.e.,Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck 1977) with two (graphite, silicate) or three(graphite, silicate, amorphous carbon) components. Though such usage is only afirst step, the results do provide interesting insight into the use of grainsize as a diagnostic of dust environment. We find that the SMC Bar extinctioncurve cannot be fit using carbon grains alone. This is a challenge to therecent observational result indicating little silicon depletion in the SMC.

Statistical models for RNA-seq data derived from a two-condition  48-replicate experiment

  High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is now the standard method todetermine differential gene expression. Identifying differentially expressedgenes crucially depends on estimates of read count variability. These estimatesare typically based on statistical models such as the negative binomialdistribution, which is employed by the tools edgeR, DESeq and cuffdiff. Untilnow, the validity of these models has usually been tested on eitherlow-replicate RNA-seq data or simulations. A 48-replicate RNA-seq experiment inyeast was performed and data tested against theoretical models. The observedgene read counts were consistent with both log-normal and negative binomialdistributions, while the mean-variance relation followed the line of constantdispersion parameter of ~0.01. The high-replicate data also allowed for strictquality control and screening of bad replicates, which can drastically affectthe gene read-count distribution. RNA-seq data have been submitted to ENAarchive with project ID PRJEB5348.

Learning Beam Search Policies via Imitation Learning

  Beam search is widely used for approximate decoding in structured predictionproblems. Models often use a beam at test time but ignore its existence attrain time, and therefore do not explicitly learn how to use the beam. Wedevelop an unifying meta-algorithm for learning beam search policies usingimitation learning. In our setting, the beam is part of the model, and not justan artifact of approximate decoding. Our meta-algorithm captures existinglearning algorithms and suggests new ones. It also lets us show novel no-regretguarantees for learning beam search policies.

The Ever Changing Circumstellar Nebula Around UW Centauri

  We present new images of the reflection nebula surrounding the R CoronaeBorealis Star, UW Cen. This nebula, first detected in 1990, has changed itsappearance significantly. At the estimated distance of UW Cen, this nebula isapproximately 0.6 ly in radius so the nebula cannot have physically altered inonly 8 years. Instead, the morphology of the nebula appears to change asdifferent parts are illuminated by light from the central star modulated byshifting thick dust clouds near its surface. These dust clouds form anddissipate at irregular intervals causing the well-known declines in the RCoronae Borealis (RCB) stars. In this way, the central star acts like alighthouse shining through holes in the dust clouds and lighting up differentportions of the nebula. The existence of this nebula provides clues to theevolutionary history of RCB stars possibly linking them to the PlanetaryNebulae and the final helium shell flash stars.

Discovery of Five New R Coronae Borealis Stars in the MACHO Galactic  Bulge Database

  We have identified five new R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Galacticbulge using the MACHO Project photometry database, raising the total number ofknown Galactic RCB stars to about 40. We have obtained spectra to confirm theidentifications. The fact that four out of the five newly identified RCB starsare ``cool'' (T(eff) < 6000 K) rather than ``warm'' (T(eff) > 6000 K) suggeststhat the preponderance of warm RCB stars among the existing sample is aselection bias. These cool RCB stars are redder and fainter than their warmcounterparts and may have been missed in surveys done with blue plates. Basedon the number of new RCB stars discovered in the MACHO bulge fields, there maybe ~250 RCB stars in the reddened "exclusion" zone toward the bulge.

The Role of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Ultraviolet Extinction.  I. Probing small molecular PAHs

  We have obtained new STIS/HST spectra to search for structure in theultraviolet interstellar extinction curve, with particular emphasis on a searchfor absorption features produced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).The presence of these molecules in the interstellar medium has been postulatedto explain the infrared emission features seen in the 3-13 $\mu$m spectra ofnumerous sources. UV spectra are uniquely capable of identifying specific PAHmolecules. We obtained high S/N UV spectra of stars which are significantlymore reddened than those observed in previous studies. These data put limits onthe role of small (30-50 carbon atoms) PAHs in UV extinction and call forfurther observations to probe the role of larger PAHs. PAHs are of importancebecause of their ubiquity and high abundance inferred from the infrared dataand also because they may link the molecular and dust phases of theinterstellar medium. A presence or absence of ultraviolet absorption bands dueto PAHs could be a definitive test of this hypothesis. We should be able todetect a 20 \AA wide feature down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of $\sim$0.02 A$_V$. Nosuch absorption features are seen other than the well-known 2175 \AA bump.

A New Feature in the Interstellar Extinction Curve at 2700 A: Diamonds  in the Rough?

  Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and archival InternationalUltraviolet Explorer (IUE) data were used to search for structure in theultraviolet interstellar extinction curve. Between 1250 and 3200 A, in additionto the well-known 2175 A bump, there is only one fairly small (10%) absorptionfeature at 2700 A. The feature is very broad (>400 A). It coincides extremelywell in position and shape with laboratory measurements of presolar diamondgrains found in meteorites. As this feature appears in both the new STIS andarchival IUE data, it is unlikely to be an instrumental effect. This featureappears to be ubiquitous in the ISM as it is seen along sightlines towardvarious clouds with reddenings in the range of E(B-V) = 0.35 to 1.73 mag. Theidentification with diamonds remains tentative since it is based on a single,weak feature. If the feature is due to interstellar diamonds then they requirean order of magnitude more absorption strength per gram/cm^2 than the presolarmeteoritic diamonds measured in the lab.

SMC-Type Interstellar Dust in the Milky Way

  It is well known that the sightline toward HD 204827 in the cluster Trumpler37 shows an UV extinction curve that does not follow CCM. However, when a dustcomponent, foreground to the cluster, is removed, the residual extinction curveis identical to that found in the SMC within the uncertainties. The curve isvery steep and has little or no 2175 A bump. The position of HD 204827 in thesky is projected onto the edge of the Cepheus IRAS Bubble. In addition, HD204827 has an IRAS bowshock indicating that it may be embedded in dust swept upby the supernova that created the IRAS Bubble. Shocks due to the supernova mayhave led to substantial processing of this dust. The HD 204827 cloud is denseand rich in carbon molecules. The 3.4 $\mu$m feature indicating a C-H grainmantle is present in the dust toward HD 204827. The environment of the HD204827 cloud dust may be similar to the dust associated with HD 62542 whichlies on the edge of a stellar wind bubble and is also dense and rich inmolecules. This sightline may be a Rosetta Stone if its environment can berelated to those in the SMC having similar dust.

Interstellar Polarization in M31

  The wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization due to dust in M31 hasbeen observed along four sightlines. Only one sightline had been measuredpreviously.The globular clusters, S78, S150, S233 and Baade 327 were used aspoint sources to probe the interstellar dust in M31. The Serkowski law producesgood fits for all the sightlines although the relationship between K andlambda(max) may be different from that found in the Galaxy. The results of thisstudy imply that the slope K/lambda(max) may be significantly larger in M31.The Serkowski curves are significantly narrower than those of the samelambda(max) in the Galaxy and may require extreme modifications to the sizedistributions of silicate particles. The fits for the four sightlines revealvalues of lambda(max) ranging from 4800 to 5500 A. These are consistent withaverage values of lambda(max) measured in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.The range measured for M31 corresponds to R(V) values of 2.7 to 3.1. The rangein R(V) seen in the Galaxy is 2.5 to 5.5 implying, for this small sample, thatthe average size ofinterstellar grains in M31 is typically smaller than thatseen for Galactic grains if the nature of the grains is the same. Also, thepolarization efficiency for these sightlines is large although some bias isexpected since sightlines known to have significant interstellar polarizationwere selected for the sample.

An Extremely Large Excess of 18O in the Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Star,  HD 137613

  We report the discovery of a uniquely large excess of 18O in thehydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, HD 137613, based on a spectrum of thefirst overtone bands of CO at 2.3-2.4 micron in which three strong absorptionbands of 12C18O are clearly present. Bands of 12C16O also are present but nobands of 13C16O or 12C17O are seen. We estimate an isotopic ratio 16O/18O ~1.The Solar value of this ratio is ~500. Neither He-core burning nor He-shellflash burning can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed inHD 137613. However, a remarkable similarity exists between the observedabundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad He-shell ofearly-AGB stars, soon after the end of He-core burning. It is not known how theouter envelope down to the He-shell could be lost but some mechanism ofenhanced mass loss must be involved. HD 137613 may be a post-early-AGB starwith the outer layers of the former He-burning shell as its photosphere.  The unusual elemental abundances of the HdC stars resemble those of the RCoronae Borealis (RCB) stars, but HdC stars do not produce clouds of dust thatproduce declines in brightness. None of the other RCB or HdC stars observedshows significant 18O.

New Ultraviolet Extinction Curves for Interstellar Dust in M31

  New low-resolution UV spectra of a sample of reddened OB stars in M31 wereobtained with HST/STIS to study the wavelength dependence of interstellarextinction and the nature of the underlying dust grain populations. Extinctioncurves were constructed for four reddened sightlines in M31 paired with closelymatching stellar atmosphere models. The new curves have a much higher S/N thanprevious studies. Direct measurements of N(H I) were made using the Ly$\alpha$absorption lines enabling gas-to-dust ratios to be calculated. The sightlineshave a range in galactocentric distance of 5 to 14 kpc and represent dust fromregions of different metallicities and gas-to-dust ratios. The metallicitiessampled range from Solar to 1.5 Solar. The measured curves show similarity tothose seen in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Maximum EntropyMethod was used to investigate the dust composition and size distribution forthe sightlines observed in this program finding that the extinction curves canbe produced with the available carbon and silicon abundances if the metallicityis super-Solar.

Magellanic-Cloud-Type Interstellar Dust Along Low Density Sightlines in  the Galaxy

  We have studied the UV extinction properties along 30 Galactic sightlinesusing data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) archive that havenever been previously examined. These distant (d > 1 kpc) sightlines wereselected to investigate the distribution and physical conditions of gas locatedin low density regions of the Galactic disk and halo. The average densitiesalong these sightlines are extremely low. It is likely that they are dominatedby the warm intercloud medium and have little contribution from the cold cloudmedium. We find that a subsample of these sightlines has extinction curves withweak bumps and very steep far-UV extinction reminiscent of the Magellanicclouds. These sightlines all lie in the region bounded by 325 < l < 0 and -5 >b > -11. The gas along these sightlines shows forbidden velocities which mayindicate that the dust has been subject to shocks. This type of low densitysightline may mimic the environments found in the Magellanic Clouds. Largevalues of N(Ca II)/N(Na I) indicating low depletion are associated with steepfar-UV extinction. A possible correlation exists between decreasing bumpstrength and increasing far-UV steepness for extinction curves in the Galaxyand the Magellanic Clouds.

A Reduction of Imitation Learning and Structured Prediction to No-Regret  Online Learning

  Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where futureobservations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the commoni.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performancein theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide strongerguarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they traineither non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number ofiterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains astationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm inan online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combinedwith additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performanceunder the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings.We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on twochallenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labelingproblem.

Embedding parameters in ab initio theory to develop well-controlled  approximations based on molecular similarity

  A means to take advantage of molecular similarity to lower the computationalcost of electronic structure theory is proposed, in which parameters areembedded into a low-cost, low-level (LL) ab initio theory and adjusted toobtain agreement with a higher level (HL) ab initio theory. This approach isexplored by training such a model on data for ethane and testing the resultingmodel on methane, propane and butane. The electronic distribution of themolecules is varied by placing them in strong electrostatic environmentsconsisting of random charges placed on the corners of a cube. The results findthat parameters embedded in HF/STO-3G theory can be adjusted to obtainagreement, to within about 2 kcal/mol, with results of HF/6-31G theory.Obtaining this level of agreement requires the use of parameters that arefunctions of the bond lengths, atomic charges, and bond orders within themolecules. The argument is made that this approach provides a well-controlledmeans to take advantage of molecular similarity in quantum chemistry.

Constant Size Molecular Descriptors For Use With Machine Learning

  A set of molecular descriptors whose length is independent of molecular sizeis developed for machine learning models that target thermodynamic andelectronic properties of molecules. These features are evaluated by monitoringperformance of kernel ridge regression models on well-studied data sets ofsmall organic molecules. The features include connectivity counts, whichrequire only the bonding pattern of the molecule, and encoded distances, whichsummarize distances between both bonded and non-bonded atoms and so require thefull molecular geometry. In addition to having constant size, these featuressummarize information regarding the local environment of atoms and bonds, suchthat models can take advantage of similarities resulting from the presence ofsimilar chemical fragments across molecules. Combining these two types offeatures leads to models whose performance is comparable to or better than thecurrent state of the art. The features introduced here have the advantage ofleading to models that may be trained on smaller molecules and then usedsuccessfully on larger molecules.

Deeply AggreVaTeD: Differentiable Imitation Learning for Sequential  Prediction

  Researchers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in sequentialdecision making problems (e.g., robotics control, sequential prediction) withdeep neural network models. One often has access to near-optimal oracles thatachieve good performance on the task during training. We demonstrate thatAggreVaTeD --- a policy gradient extension of the Imitation Learning (IL)approach of (Ross & Bagnell, 2014) --- can leverage such an oracle to achievefaster and better solutions with less training data than a less-informedReinforcement Learning (RL) technique. Using both feedforward and recurrentneural network predictors, we present stochastic gradient procedures on asequential prediction task, dependency-parsing from raw image data, as well ason various high dimensional robotics control problems. We also provide acomprehensive theoretical study of IL that demonstrates we can expect up toexponentially lower sample complexity for learning with AggreVaTeD than with RLalgorithms, which backs our empirical findings. Our results and theory indicatethat the proposed approach can achieve superior performance with respect to theoracle when the demonstrator is sub-optimal.

Dual Policy Iteration

  Recently, a novel class of Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms havedemonstrated impressive practical performance (e.g., ExIt from [2],AlphaGo-Zero from [27]). This new family of algorithms maintains, andalternately optimizes, two policies: a fast, reactive policy (e.g., a deepneural network) deployed at test time, and a slow, non-reactive policy (e.g.,Tree Search), that can plan multiple steps ahead. The reactive policy isupdated under supervision from the non-reactive policy, while the non-reactivepolicy is improved with guidance from the reactive policy. In this work westudy this Dual Policy Iteration (DPI) strategy in an alternating optimizationframework and provide a convergence analysis that extends existing API theory.We also develop a special instance of this framework which reduces the updateof non-reactive policies to model-based optimal control using learned localmodels, and provides a theoretically sound way of unifying model-free andmodel-based RL approaches with unknown dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy ofour approach on various continuous control Markov Decision Processes.

FUSE Measurements of Far-Ultraviolet Extinction. III. The Dependence on  R(V) and Discrete Feature Limits from 75 Galactic Sightlines

  We present a sample of 75 extinction curves derived from FUSE far-ultravioletspectra supplemented by existing IUE spectra. The extinction curves werecreated using the standard pair method based on a new set of dereddenedFUSE+IUE comparison stars. Molecular hydrogen absorption features were removedusing individualized H_2 models for each sightline. The general shape of theFUSE extinction (8.4 micron^-1 < lambda^-1 < 11 micron^-1) was found to bebroadly consistent with extrapolations from the IUE extinction (3.3 micron-1 <lambda^-1 < 8.6 micron^-1) curve. Significant differences were seen in thestrength of the far-UV rise and the width of the 2175 A bump. All the FUSE+IUEextinction curves had positive far-UV slopes giving no indication that thefar-UV rise was turning over at the shortest wavelengths. The dependence ofA(lambda)/A(V) versus R(V)^-1 in the far-UV using the sightlines in our samplewas found to be stronger than tentatively indicated by previous work. Wepresent an updated R(V) dependent relationship for the full UV wavelength range(3.3 micron^-1 <= lambda^-1 <= 11 micron^-1). Finally, we searched for discreteabsorption features in the far-ultraviolet. We found a 3 sigma upper limit of~0.12 A(V) on features with a resolution of 250 (~4 A width) and 3 sigma upperlimits of ~0.15 A(V) for lambda^-1 < 9.6 micron^-1 and ~0.68 A(V) for lambda^-1> 9.6 micron^-1 on features with a resolution of 10^4 (~0.1 A width).

Closing the Learning-Planning Loop with Predictive State Representations

  A central problem in artificial intelligence is that of planning to maximizefuture reward under uncertainty in a partially observable environment. In thispaper we propose and demonstrate a novel algorithm which accurately learns amodel of such an environment directly from sequences of action-observationpairs. We then close the loop from observations to actions by planning in thelearned model and recovering a policy which is near-optimal in the originalenvironment. Specifically, we present an efficient and statistically consistentspectral algorithm for learning the parameters of a Predictive StateRepresentation (PSR). We demonstrate the algorithm by learning a model of asimulated high-dimensional, vision-based mobile robot planning task, and thenperform approximate point-based planning in the learned PSR. Analysis of ourresults shows that the algorithm learns a state space which efficientlycaptures the essential features of the environment. This representation allowsaccurate prediction with a small number of parameters, and enables successfuland efficient planning.

Allen Telescope Array Multi-Frequency Observations of the Sun

  We present the first observations of the Sun with the Allen Telescope Array(ATA). We used up to six frequencies, from 1.43 to 6 GHz, and baselines from 6to 300 m. To our knowledge, these are the first simultaneous multifrequencyfull-Sun maps obtained at microwave frequencies without mosaicing. Theobservations took place when the Sun was relatively quiet, although at leastone active region was present each time. We present multi-frequency fluxbudgets for each sources on the Sun. Outside of active regions, assumingoptically thin bremsstrahlung (free--free) coronal emission on top of anoptically thick ~10 000 K chromosphere, the multi-frequency information can becondensed into a single, frequency-independent, "coronal bremsstrahlungcontribution function" [EM/sqrt(T)] map. This technique allows the separationof the physics of emission as well as a measurement of the density structure ofthe corona. Deviations from this simple relationship usually indicate thepresence of an additional gyroresonance-emission component, as is typical inactive regions.

Two-Manifold Problems

  Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learningmanifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had somesuccesses, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust tonoise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in whichwe simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing adifferent view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learningproblems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifoldalgorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: eachview allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same waythat an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear}dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms fortwo-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covarianceoperators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifoldproblems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem canaid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.

A Spectral Learning Approach to Range-Only SLAM

  We present a novel spectral learning algorithm for simultaneous localizationand mapping (SLAM) from range data with known correspondences. This algorithmis an instance of a general spectral system identification framework, fromwhich it inherits several desirable properties, including statisticalconsistency and no local optima. Compared with popular batch optimization ormultiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) methods for range-only SLAM, our spectralapproach offers guaranteed low computational requirements and good trackingperformance. Compared with popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) or extendedinformation filter (EIF) approaches, and many MHT ones, our approach does notneed to linearize a transition or measurement model; such linearizations cancause severe errors in EKFs and EIFs, and to a lesser extent MHT, particularlyfor the highly non-Gaussian posteriors encountered in range-only SLAM. Weprovide a theoretical analysis of our method, including finite-sample errorbounds. Finally, we demonstrate on a real-world robotic SLAM problem that ouralgorithm is not only theoretically justified, but works well in practice: in acomparison of multiple methods, the lowest errors come from a combination ofour algorithm with batch optimization, but our method alone produces nearly asgood a result at far lower computational cost.

An Efficient, Expressive and Local Minima-free Method for Learning  Controlled Dynamical Systems

  We propose a framework for modeling and estimating the state of controlleddynamical systems, where an agent can affect the system through actions andreceives partial observations. Based on this framework, we propose thePredictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFFPSR). A keyproperty in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditionaldistribution of future observations given future actions. RFF-PSRs combine thisrepresentation with moment-matching, kernel embedding and local optimization toachieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can representcontrolled environments which can be affected by actions; it has an efficientand theoretically justified learning algorithm; it uses a non-parametricrepresentation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-lineardynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and anexperimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

Unsupervised Learning for Nonlinear PieceWise Smooth Hybrid Systems

  This paper introduces a novel system identification and tracking method forPieceWise Smooth (PWS) nonlinear stochastic hybrid systems. We are able tocorrectly identify and track challenging problems with diverse dynamics and lowdimensional transitions. We exploit the composite structure system to learn asimpler model on each component/mode. We use Gaussian Process Regressiontechniques to learn smooth, nonlinear manifolds across mode transitions,guard-regions, and make multi-step ahead predictions on each mode dynamics. Wecombine a PWS non-linear model with a particle filter to effectively trackmulti-modal transitions. We further use synthetic oversampling techniques toaddress the challenge of detecting mode transition which is sparse compared tomode dynamics. This work provides an effective form of model learning in acomplex hybrid system, which can be useful for future integration in areinforcement learning setting. We compare multi-step prediction and trackingperformance against traditional dynamical system tracking methods, such as EKFand Switching Gaussian Processes, and show that this framework performssignificantly better, being able to correctly track complex dynamics withsparse transitions.

An Empirical Study of Example Forgetting during Deep Neural Network  Learning

  Inspired by the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, we investigate thelearning dynamics of neural networks as they train on single classificationtasks. Our goal is to understand whether a related phenomenon occurs when datadoes not undergo a clear distributional shift. We define a `forgetting event'to have occurred when an individual training example transitions from beingclassified correctly to incorrectly over the course of learning. Across severalbenchmark data sets, we find that: (i) certain examples are forgotten with highfrequency, and some not at all; (ii) a data set's (un)forgettable examplesgeneralize across neural architectures; and (iii) based on forgetting dynamics,a significant fraction of examples can be omitted from the training data setwhile still maintaining state-of-the-art generalization performance.

The Circumstellar Environment of R Coronae Borealis: White Dwarf Merger  or Final Helium Shell Flash?

  In 2007, R Coronae Borealis (R CrB) went into an historically deep and longdecline. In this state, the dust acts like a natural coronagraph at visiblewavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. Imaging hasbeen obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with Gemini/GMOS, HST/WFPC2, Spitzer/MIPS,and Herschel/SPIRE. Several of the structures around R CrB are cometaryglobules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. The estimateddust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the R CrBdeclines if they form along the line of sight to the star. In addition, thereis a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containingcool 25 K dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. The SED of R CrBcan be well fit by a 150 AU disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelopewhich corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. The total masses ofthe disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 M(Sun), respectively, assuming agas-to-dust ratio of 100. The evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger ora final-helium-shell flash origin for R CrB is contradictory. The shell and thecometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. Along with thefact that R CrB shows significant Lithium in its atmosphere, this supports thefinal-helium-shell flash. However, the relatively high inferred mass of R CrBand its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.

The MACHO Project LMC Variable Star Inventory: X. The R Coronae Borealis  Stars

  We report the discovery of eight new R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in theLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the MACHO project photometry database. Thediscovery of these new stars increases the number of known RCB stars in the LMCto thirteen. We have also discovered four stars similar to the Galacticvariable DY Per. These stars decline much more slowly and are cooler than theRCB stars. The absolute luminosities of the Galactic RCB stars are unknownsince there is no direct measurement of the distance to any Galactic RCB star.Hence, the importance of the LMC RCB stars. We find a much larger range ofabsolute magnitudes (M(V) = -2.5 to -5 mag) than inferred from the smallpre-MACHO sample of LMC RCB stars. It is likely that there is a temperature -M(V)relationship with the cooler stars being intrinsically fainter. Cool (~5000K) RCB stars are much more common than previously thought based on the GalacticRCB star sample. Using the fairly complete sample of RCB stars discovered inthe MACHO fields, we have estimated the likely number of RCB stars in theGalaxy to be ~3,200. The SMC MACHO fields were also searched for RCB stars butnone were found.

Measuring Extinction Curves of Lensing Galaxies

  We critique the method of constructing extinction curves of lensing galaxiesusing multiply imaged QSOs. If one of the two QSO images is lightly reddened orif the dust along both sightlines has the same properties then the method workswell and produces an extinction curve for the lensing galaxy. These cases arelikely rare and hard to confirm. However, if the dust along each sightline hasdifferent properties then the resulting curve is no longer a measurement ofextinction. Instead, it is a measurement of the difference between twoextinction curves. This "lens difference curve'' does contain information aboutthe dust properties, but extracting a meaningful extinction curve is notpossible without additional, currently unknown information. As a quantitativeexample, we show that the combination of two Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (CCM)type extinction curves having different values of R(V) will produce a CCMextinction curve with a value of R(V) which is dependent on the individual R(V)values and the ratio of V band extinctions. The resulting lens difference curveis not an average of the dust along the two sightlines. We find that lensdifference curves with any value of R(V), even negative values, can be producedby a combination of two reddened sightlines with different CCM extinctioncurves with R(V) values consistent with Milky Way dust (2.1 < R(V) < 5.6). Thismay explain extreme values of R(V) inferred by this method in previous studies.But lens difference curves with more normal values of R(V) are just as likelyto be composed of two dust extinction curves with R(V) values different thanthat of the lens difference curve. While it is not possible to determine theindividual extinction curves making up a lens difference curve, there isinformation about a galaxy's dust contained in the lens difference curves.

Detection of Near-IR CO Absorption Bands in R Coronae Borealis Stars

  R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich pulsatingpost-AGB stars that experience massive irregular declines in brightness causedby circumstellar dust formation. The mechanism of dust formation around RCBstars is not well understood. It has been proposed that CO molecules play animportant role in cooling the circumstellar gas so that dust may form. Wereport on a survey for CO in a sample of RCB stars. We obtained H- and K-bandspectra including the first and second overtone CO bands for eight RCB stars,the RCB-like star, DY Per and the final-helium-flash star, FG Sge. The firstand second overtone CO bands were detected in the cooler (T(eff)<6000 K) RCBstars, Z Umi, ES Aql, SV Sge and DY Per. The bands are not present in thewarmer (T(eff)>6000 K) RCB stars, R CrB, RY Sgr, SU Tau, XX Cam. In addition,first overtone bands are seen in FG Sge, a final-helium-flash star that is inan RCB-like phase at present. Effective temperatures of the eight RCB starsrange from 4000 to 7250 K. The observed photospheric CO absorption bands werecompared to line-blanketed model spectra of RCB stars. As predicted by themodels, the CO bands are strongest in the coolest RCB stars and not present inthe warmest. No correlation was found between the presence or strength of theCO bands and dust formation activity in the stars.

Improved annotation of 3-prime untranslated regions and complex loci by  combination of strand-specific Direct RNA Sequencing, RNA-seq and ESTs

  The reference annotations made for a genome sequence provide the frameworkfor all subsequent analyses of the genome. Correct annotation is particularlyimportant when interpreting the results of RNA-seq experiments where shortsequence reads are mapped against the genome and assigned to genes according tothe annotation. Inconsistencies in annotations between the reference and theexperimental system can lead to incorrect interpretation of the effect on RNAexpression of an experimental treatment or mutation in the system under study.Until recently, the genome-wide annotation of 3-prime untranslated regionsreceived less attention than coding regions and the delineation of intron/exonboundaries. In this paper, data produced for samples in Human, Chicken and A.thaliana by the novel single-molecule, strand-specific, Direct RNA Sequencingtechnology from Helicos Biosciences which locates 3-prime polyadenylation sitesto within +/- 2 nt, were combined with archival EST and RNA-Seq data. Nineexamples are illustrated where this combination of data allowed: (1) gene and3-prime UTR re-annotation (including extension of one 3-prime UTR by 5.9 kb);(2) disentangling of gene expression in complex regions; (3) clearerinterpretation of small RNA expression and (4) identification of novel genes.While the specific examples displayed here may become obsolete as genomesequences and their annotations are refined, the principles laid out in thispaper will be of general use both to those annotating genomes and those seekingto interpret existing publically available annotations in the context of theirown experimental data

Planets and IR Excesses: Preliminary Results from a Spitzer/MIPS Survey  of Solar-Type Stars

  As part of a large Spitzer/MIPS GTO program, we have searched for infraredexcesses due to debris disks toward 26 FGK field stars known from radialvelocity (RV) studies to have one or more planets. While none of these starsshow excesses at 24um, we have detected 70um excesses around 6 stars at the3-sigma confidence level. The excesses are produced by cool material (< 100 K)located beyond 10 AU, well outside the "habitable zones" of these systems andconsistent with the presence of Kuiper Belt analogues with ~100 times moreemitting surface area than in our own planetary system.  These planet-bearing stars are, by selection for RV studies, typically olderthan 1 Gyr, and the stars identified here with excesses have a median age of 4Gyr. We find a preliminary correlation of both the frequency and the magnitudeof dust emission with the presence of known planets. These are the first starsoutside the solar system identified as having both well-confirmed planetarysystems and well-confirmed IR excesses.

Massive-Star Supernovae as Major Dust Factories

  We present late-time optical and mid-infrared observations of the Type-IIsupernova 2003gd in NGC 628. Mid-infrared excesses consistent with cooling dustin the ejecta are observed 499-678 days after outburst, and are accompanied byincreasing optical extinction and growing asymmetries in the emission-lineprofiles. Radiative-transfer models show that up to 0.02 solar masses of dusthas formed within the ejecta, beginning as early as 250 days after outburst.These observations show that dust formation in supernova ejecta can beefficient and that massive-star supernovae can be major dust producersthroughout the history of the Universe.

Embedding parameters in ab initio theory to develop approximations based  on molecular similarity

  A means to take advantage of molecular similarity to lower the computationalcost of electronic structure theory is explored, in which parameters areembedded into a low-cost, low-level (LL) ab initio model and adjusted to obtainagreement with results from a higher-level (HL) ab initio model. A parametrizedLL (pLL) model is created by multiplying selected matrix elements of theHamiltonian operators by scaling factors that depend on element types. Variousschemes for applying the scaling factors are compared, along with the impact ofmaking the scaling factors linear functions of variables related to bondlengths, atomic charges, and bond orders. The models are trained on ethane andethylene, substituted with -NH2, -OH and -F, and tested on substituted propane,propylene and t-butane. Training and test datasets are created by distortingthe molecular geometries and applying uniform electric fields. The fittedproperties include changes in total energy arising from geometric distortionsor applied fields, and frontier orbital energies. The impacts of includingadditional training data, such as decomposition of the energy by operator orinteraction of the electron density with external charges, are also explored.The best-performing model forms reduce the root mean square (RMS) differencebetween the HL and LL energy predictions by over 85% on the training data andover 75% on the test data. The argument is made that this approach has thepotential to provide a flexible and systematically-improvable means to takeadvantage of molecular similarity in quantum chemistry.

Evaluation of tools for differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq  on a 48 biological replicate experiment

  An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of 2 conditionswas performed to determine the number of biological replicates ($n_r$)required, and to identify the most effective statistical analysis tools foridentifying differential gene expression (DGE). When $n_r=3$, seven of the ninetools evaluated give true positive rates (TPR) of only 20 to 40 percent. Forhigh fold-change genes ($|log_{2}(FC)|\gt2$) the TPR is $\gt85$ percent. Twotools performed poorly; over- or under-predicting the number of differentiallyexpressed genes. Increasing replication gives a large increase in TPR whenconsidering all DE genes but only a small increase for high fold-change genes.Achieving a TPR $\gt85$% across all fold-changes requires $n_r\gt20$. Forfuture RNA-seq experiments these results suggest $n_r\gt6$, rising to$n_r\gt12$ when identifying DGE irrespective of fold-change is important. For$6 \lt n_r \lt 12$, superior TPR makes edgeR the leading tool tested. For $n_r\ge12$, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq outperforms theother tools.

Tuning the Molecular Weight Distribution from Atom Transfer Radical  Polymerization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

  We devise a novel technique to control the shape of polymer molecular weightdistributions (MWDs) in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Thistechnique makes use of recent advances in both simulation-based, model-freereinforcement learning (RL) and the numerical simulation of ATRP. A simulationof ATRP is built that allows an RL controller to add chemical reagentsthroughout the course of the reaction. The RL controller incorporatesfully-connected and convolutional neural network architectures and bases itsdecision upon the current status of the ATRP reaction. The initial, untrained,controller leads to ending MWDs with large variability, allowing the RLalgorithm to explore a large search space. When trained using an actor-criticalgorithm, the RL controller is able to discover and optimize control policiesthat lead to a variety of target MWDs. The target MWDs include Gaussians ofvarious width, and more diverse shapes such as bimodal distributions. Thelearned control policies are robust and transfer to similar but not identicalATRP reaction settings, even under the presence of simulated noise. We believethis work is a proof-of-concept for employing modern artificial intelligencetechniques in the synthesis of new functional polymer materials.

A Quantitative Comparison of SMC, LMC, and Milky Way UV to NIR  Extinction Curves

  We present an exhaustive, quantitative comparison of all of the knownextinction curves in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) withour understanding of the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. TheR_V dependent CCM relationship and the sample of extinction curves used toderive this relationship is used to describe the general behavior of Milky Wayextinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curvesare derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curvewhich was measured using HST/STIS observations. The optical extinction curvesare derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for theLMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASSphotometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinctioncurve, we give R_V = A(V)/E(B-V) and N(HI) values which probe the same dustcolumn as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMCextinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve byitself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R_V, andbehavior of the extinction curve FM fit parameters with R_V. As has been foundpreviously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistentwith the CCM relationship, but majority of the LMC and all of the SMC curves donot follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCMrelationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the LMC and SMCextinction curves. This result strengthens the picture of dust extinctioncurves exhibit a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Wayand the SMC Bar. (abridged)

Ultraviolet Extinction Properties in the Milky Way

  We have assembled a homogeneous database of 417 ultraviolet (UV) extinctioncurves for reddened sightlines having International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)spectra. We have combined these with optical and 2MASS photometry allowingestimates of the ratio of total-to-selective extinction, R(V), for the entiresample. Fitzpatrick-Massa (FM) parameters have also been found for the entiresample. This is the largest study of parameterized UV extinction curves yetpublished and it covers a wide range of environments, from dense molecularclouds to the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), with extinctions A(V) rangingfrom 0.50 to 4.80. It is the first to extend far beyond the solar neighborhoodand into the Galaxy at large, with 30 sightlines having distances > 5 kpc.Previously, the longest sightlines with FM parameters and R(V) extended ~ 1kpc. We find that (1.) the CCM extinction law applies for 93% of thesightlines, implying that dust processing in the Galaxy is efficient andsystematic; (2.) the central wavelength of the 2175 A bump is constant; (3.)the 2175 A bump width is dependent on environment. Only four sightlines showsystematic deviations from CCM, HD 29647, 62542, 204827, and 210121. Thesesightlines all sample dense, molecule-rich clouds. The new extinction curvesand values of R(V) allow us to revise the CCM law.

Reduced-Rank Hidden Markov Models

  We introduce the Reduced-Rank Hidden Markov Model (RR-HMM), a generalizationof HMMs that can model smooth state evolution as in Linear Dynamical Systems(LDSs) as well as non-log-concave predictive distributions as incontinuous-observation HMMs. RR-HMMs assume an m-dimensional latent state and ndiscrete observations, with a transition matrix of rank k <= m. This impliesthe dynamics evolve in a k-dimensional subspace, while the shape of the set ofpredictive distributions is determined by m. Latent state belief is representedwith a k-dimensional state vector and inference is carried out entirely in R^k,making RR-HMMs as computationally efficient as k-state HMMs yet moreexpressive. To learn RR-HMMs, we relax the assumptions of a recently proposedspectral learning algorithm for HMMs (Hsu, Kakade and Zhang 2009) and apply itto learn k-dimensional observable representations of rank-k RR-HMMs. Thealgorithm is consistent and free of local optima, and we extend its performanceguarantees to cover the RR-HMM case. We show how this algorithm can be used inconjunction with a kernel density estimator to efficiently modelhigh-dimensional multivariate continuous data. We also relax the assumptionthat single observations are sufficient to disambiguate state, and extend thealgorithm accordingly. Experiments on synthetic data and a toy video, as wellas on a difficult robot vision modeling problem, yield accurate models thatcompare favorably with standard alternatives in simulation quality andprediction capability.

Predictive State Temporal Difference Learning

  We propose a new approach to value function approximation which combineslinear temporal difference reinforcement learning with subspace identification.In practical applications, reinforcement learning (RL) is complicated by thefact that state is either high-dimensional or partially observable. Therefore,RL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than stateitself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by thesuitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification(SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as muchinformation as possible about state. In this paper we connect the twoapproaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large setof features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value functionapproximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, calledPredictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictivestate representations, PSTD finds a linear compression operator that projects alarge set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount ofpredictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion toestimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and priorapproaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent,perform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate itspotential on a difficult optimal stopping problem.

Multiple Source Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Training of Neural  Networks

  While domain adaptation has been actively researched in recent years, mosttheoretical results and algorithms focus on the single-source-single-targetadaptation setting. Naive application of such algorithms on multiple sourcedomain adaptation problem may lead to suboptimal solutions. As a step towardbridging the gap, we propose a new generalization bound for domain adaptationwhen there are multiple source domains with labeled instances and one targetdomain with unlabeled instances. Compared with existing bounds, the new bounddoes not require expert knowledge about the target distribution, nor theoptimal combination rule for multisource domains. Interestingly, our theoryalso leads to an efficient learning strategy using adversarial neural networks:we show how to interpret it as learning feature representations that areinvariant to the multiple domain shifts while still being discriminative forthe learning task. To this end, we propose two models, both of which we callmultisource domain adversarial networks (MDANs): the first model optimizesdirectly our bound, while the second model is a smoothed approximation of thefirst one, leading to a more data-efficient and task-adaptive model. Theoptimization tasks of both models are minimax saddle point problems that can beoptimized by adversarial training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MDANs,we conduct extensive experiments showing superior adaptation performance onthree real-world datasets: sentiment analysis, digit classification, andvehicle counting.

On Learning Invariant Representation for Domain Adaptation

  Due to the ability of deep neural nets to learn rich representations, recentadvances in unsupervised domain adaptation have focused on learningdomain-invariant features that achieve a small error on the source domain. Thehope is that the learnt representation, together with the hypothesis learntfrom the source domain, can generalize to the target domain. In this paper, wefirst construct a simple counterexample showing that, contrary to commonbelief, the above conditions are not sufficient to guarantee successful domainadaptation. In particular, the counterexample (Fig. 1) exhibits\emph{conditional shift}: the class-conditional distributions of input featureschange between source and target domains. To give a sufficient condition fordomain adaptation, we propose a natural and interpretable generalization upperbound that explicitly takes into account the aforementioned shift. Moreover, weshed new light on the problem by proving an information-theoretic lower boundon the joint error of \emph{any} domain adaptation method that attempts tolearn invariant representations. Our result characterizes a fundamentaltradeoff between learning invariant representations and achieving small jointerror on both domains when the marginal label distributions differ from sourceto target. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets thatcorroborate our theoretical findings. We believe these insights are helpful inguiding the future design of domain adaptation and representation learningalgorithms.

FUSE Measurements of Far Ultraviolet Extinction. II. Magellanic Cloud  Sight Lines

  We present an extinction analysis of 9 paths through the LMC and SMC based onFUSE observations. To date, just two LMC sight lines have probed dust graincomposition and size distributions in the Clouds using spectra includingwavelengths as short as 950 A. We supplement these with results from 4 regionsdistinguished by their IR through UV extinction curves and grouped as LMCAvg,LMC2, SMC bar and SMC wing. Despite the distinct characters of Milky Way andMagellanic Cloud extinction, our results are generally analogous to those foundfor Galactic curves in that the FUSE portions of each extinction curve aredescribed reasonably well by FM curves fitted only to longer wavelength dataand lack any dramatic new extinction features, and any deviations from the CCMformalism continue into FUV wavelengths. An MEM analysis of these curvessuggests that LMCAvg and SMC wing sight lines require more silicon and/orcarbon in dust than current abundance measurements would allow, while therequirements for LMC2 and SMC bar sight lines do not fully tax the availablereservoirs. An intermediate product of this analysis is the measurement of newH_2 abundances in the Magellanic Clouds. Collectively considering Cloud sightlines that possess significant H_2 column densities, E(B-V)/N(HI) ratios arereduced by significant factors relative to the Galactic mean, whereas thecorresponding E(B-V)/N(H_2) values more closely resemble their Galacticcounterpart. These trends reflect the fact that among these sight linesf(H_2)-values are lower than those common in the Milky Way for paths withsimilar degrees of reddening.

A Density Functional Tight Binding Layer for Deep Learning of Chemical  Hamiltonians

  Current neural networks for predictions of molecular properties use quantumchemistry only as a source of training data. This paper explores models thatuse quantum chemistry as an integral part of the prediction process. This isdone by implementing self-consistent-charge Density-Functional-Tight-Binding(DFTB) theory as a layer for use in deep learning models. The DFTB layer takes,as input, Hamiltonian matrix elements generated from earlier layers andproduces, as output, electronic properties from self-consistent field solutionsof the corresponding DFTB Hamiltonian. Backpropagation enables efficienttraining of the model to target electronic properties. Two types of input tothe DFTB layer are explored, splines and feed-forward neural networks. Becauseoverfitting can cause models trained on smaller molecules to perform poorly onlarger molecules, regularizations are applied that penalize non-monotonicbehavior and deviation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements from those of thepublished DFTB model used to initialize the model. The approach is evaluated on15,700 hydrocarbons by comparing the root mean square error in energy anddipole moment, on test molecules with 8 heavy atoms, to the error from theinitial DFTB model. When trained on molecules with up to 7 heavy atoms, thespline model reduces the test error in energy by 60% and in dipole moments by42%. The neural network model performs somewhat better, with error reductionsof 67% and 59% respectively. Training on molecules with up to 4 heavy atomsreduces performance, with both the spline and neural net models reducing thetest error in energy by about 53% and in dipole by about 25%.

Evidence for a Long-period Planet Orbiting Epsilon Eridani

  High precision radial velocity (RV) measurements spanning the years1980.8--2000.0 are presented for the nearby (3.22 pc) K2 V star $\epsilon$ Eri.These data, which represent a combination of six independent data sets takenwith four different telescopes, show convincing variations with a period of$\approx$ 7 yrs. A least squares orbital solution using robust estimationyields orbital parameters of period, $P$ = 6.9 yrs, velocity $K$-amplitude $=$19 {\ms}, eccentricity $e$ $=$ 0.6, projected companion mass $M$ sin $i$ = 0.86$M_{Jupiter}$, and semi-major axis $a_2$ $=$ 3.3 AU. Ca II H&K S-indexmeasurements spanning the same time interval show significant variations withperiods of 3 and 20 yrs, yet none at the RV period. If magnetic activity wereresponsible for the RV variations then it produces a significantly differentperiod than is seen in the Ca II data. Given the lack of Ca II variation withthe same period as that found in the RV measurements, the long-lived andcoherent nature of these variations, and the high eccentricity of the impliedorbit, Keplerian motion due to a planetary companion seems to be the mostlikely explanation for the observed RV variations. The wide angular separationof the planet from the star (approximately 1 arc-second) and the long orbitalperiod make this planet a prime candidate for both direct imaging andspace-based astrometric measurements.
