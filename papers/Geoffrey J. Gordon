Fast Solutions to Projective Monotone Linear Complementarity Problems

  We present a new interior-point potential-reduction algorithm for solving
monotone linear complementarity problems (LCPs) that have a particular special
structure: their matrix $M\in{\mathbb R}^{n\times n}$ can be decomposed as
$M=\Phi U + \Pi_0$, where the rank of $\Phi$ is $k<n$, and $\Pi_0$ denotes
Euclidean projection onto the nullspace of $\Phi^\top$. We call such LCPs
projective. Our algorithm solves a monotone projective LCP to relative accuracy
$\epsilon$ in $O(\sqrt n \ln(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, with each iteration
requiring $O(nk^2)$ flops. This complexity compares favorably with
interior-point algorithms for general monotone LCPs: these algorithms also
require $O(\sqrt n \ln(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, but each iteration needs to
solve an $n\times n$ system of linear equations, a much higher cost than our
algorithm when $k\ll n$. Our algorithm works even though the solution to a
projective LCP is not restricted to lie in any low-rank subspace.


Galerkin Methods for Complementarity Problems and Variational
  Inequalities

  Complementarity problems and variational inequalities arise in a wide variety
of areas, including machine learning, planning, game theory, and physical
simulation. In all of these areas, to handle large-scale problem instances, we
need fast approximate solution methods. One promising idea is Galerkin
approximation, in which we search for the best answer within the span of a
given set of basis functions. Bertsekas proposed one possible Galerkin method
for variational inequalities. However, this method can exhibit two problems in
practice: its approximation error is worse than might be expected based on the
ability of the basis to represent the desired solution, and each iteration
requires a projection step that is not always easy to implement efficiently.
So, in this paper, we present a new Galerkin method with improved behavior: our
new error bounds depend directly on the distance from the true solution to the
subspace spanned by our basis, and the only projections we require are onto the
feasible region or onto the span of our basis.


Dust Grain-Size Distributions From MRN to MEM

  Employing the Maximum Entropy Method algorithm, we fit interstellar
extinction measurements which span the wavelength range 0.125-3 micron. We
present a uniform set of MEM model fits, all using the same grain materials,
optical constants and abundance constraints. In addition, we are taking
advantage of improved UV and IR data and better estimates of the gas-to-dust
ratio. The model fits cover the entire range of extinction properties that have
been seen in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The grain models employed
for this presentation are the simplistic homogeneous spheres models (i.e.,
Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck 1977) with two (graphite, silicate) or three
(graphite, silicate, amorphous carbon) components. Though such usage is only a
first step, the results do provide interesting insight into the use of grain
size as a diagnostic of dust environment. We find that the SMC Bar extinction
curve cannot be fit using carbon grains alone. This is a challenge to the
recent observational result indicating little silicon depletion in the SMC.


Statistical models for RNA-seq data derived from a two-condition
  48-replicate experiment

  High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is now the standard method to
determine differential gene expression. Identifying differentially expressed
genes crucially depends on estimates of read count variability. These estimates
are typically based on statistical models such as the negative binomial
distribution, which is employed by the tools edgeR, DESeq and cuffdiff. Until
now, the validity of these models has usually been tested on either
low-replicate RNA-seq data or simulations. A 48-replicate RNA-seq experiment in
yeast was performed and data tested against theoretical models. The observed
gene read counts were consistent with both log-normal and negative binomial
distributions, while the mean-variance relation followed the line of constant
dispersion parameter of ~0.01. The high-replicate data also allowed for strict
quality control and screening of bad replicates, which can drastically affect
the gene read-count distribution. RNA-seq data have been submitted to ENA
archive with project ID PRJEB5348.


Learning Beam Search Policies via Imitation Learning

  Beam search is widely used for approximate decoding in structured prediction
problems. Models often use a beam at test time but ignore its existence at
train time, and therefore do not explicitly learn how to use the beam. We
develop an unifying meta-algorithm for learning beam search policies using
imitation learning. In our setting, the beam is part of the model, and not just
an artifact of approximate decoding. Our meta-algorithm captures existing
learning algorithms and suggests new ones. It also lets us show novel no-regret
guarantees for learning beam search policies.


The Ever Changing Circumstellar Nebula Around UW Centauri

  We present new images of the reflection nebula surrounding the R Coronae
Borealis Star, UW Cen. This nebula, first detected in 1990, has changed its
appearance significantly. At the estimated distance of UW Cen, this nebula is
approximately 0.6 ly in radius so the nebula cannot have physically altered in
only 8 years. Instead, the morphology of the nebula appears to change as
different parts are illuminated by light from the central star modulated by
shifting thick dust clouds near its surface. These dust clouds form and
dissipate at irregular intervals causing the well-known declines in the R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. In this way, the central star acts like a
lighthouse shining through holes in the dust clouds and lighting up different
portions of the nebula. The existence of this nebula provides clues to the
evolutionary history of RCB stars possibly linking them to the Planetary
Nebulae and the final helium shell flash stars.


Discovery of Five New R Coronae Borealis Stars in the MACHO Galactic
  Bulge Database

  We have identified five new R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Galactic
bulge using the MACHO Project photometry database, raising the total number of
known Galactic RCB stars to about 40. We have obtained spectra to confirm the
identifications. The fact that four out of the five newly identified RCB stars
are ``cool'' (T(eff) < 6000 K) rather than ``warm'' (T(eff) > 6000 K) suggests
that the preponderance of warm RCB stars among the existing sample is a
selection bias. These cool RCB stars are redder and fainter than their warm
counterparts and may have been missed in surveys done with blue plates. Based
on the number of new RCB stars discovered in the MACHO bulge fields, there may
be ~250 RCB stars in the reddened "exclusion" zone toward the bulge.


The Role of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Ultraviolet Extinction.
  I. Probing small molecular PAHs

  We have obtained new STIS/HST spectra to search for structure in the
ultraviolet interstellar extinction curve, with particular emphasis on a search
for absorption features produced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
The presence of these molecules in the interstellar medium has been postulated
to explain the infrared emission features seen in the 3-13 $\mu$m spectra of
numerous sources. UV spectra are uniquely capable of identifying specific PAH
molecules. We obtained high S/N UV spectra of stars which are significantly
more reddened than those observed in previous studies. These data put limits on
the role of small (30-50 carbon atoms) PAHs in UV extinction and call for
further observations to probe the role of larger PAHs. PAHs are of importance
because of their ubiquity and high abundance inferred from the infrared data
and also because they may link the molecular and dust phases of the
interstellar medium. A presence or absence of ultraviolet absorption bands due
to PAHs could be a definitive test of this hypothesis. We should be able to
detect a 20 \AA wide feature down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of $\sim$0.02 A$_V$. No
such absorption features are seen other than the well-known 2175 \AA bump.


A New Feature in the Interstellar Extinction Curve at 2700 A: Diamonds
  in the Rough?

  Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and archival International
Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) data were used to search for structure in the
ultraviolet interstellar extinction curve. Between 1250 and 3200 A, in addition
to the well-known 2175 A bump, there is only one fairly small (10%) absorption
feature at 2700 A. The feature is very broad (>400 A). It coincides extremely
well in position and shape with laboratory measurements of presolar diamond
grains found in meteorites. As this feature appears in both the new STIS and
archival IUE data, it is unlikely to be an instrumental effect. This feature
appears to be ubiquitous in the ISM as it is seen along sightlines toward
various clouds with reddenings in the range of E(B-V) = 0.35 to 1.73 mag. The
identification with diamonds remains tentative since it is based on a single,
weak feature. If the feature is due to interstellar diamonds then they require
an order of magnitude more absorption strength per gram/cm^2 than the presolar
meteoritic diamonds measured in the lab.


SMC-Type Interstellar Dust in the Milky Way

  It is well known that the sightline toward HD 204827 in the cluster Trumpler
37 shows an UV extinction curve that does not follow CCM. However, when a dust
component, foreground to the cluster, is removed, the residual extinction curve
is identical to that found in the SMC within the uncertainties. The curve is
very steep and has little or no 2175 A bump. The position of HD 204827 in the
sky is projected onto the edge of the Cepheus IRAS Bubble. In addition, HD
204827 has an IRAS bowshock indicating that it may be embedded in dust swept up
by the supernova that created the IRAS Bubble. Shocks due to the supernova may
have led to substantial processing of this dust. The HD 204827 cloud is dense
and rich in carbon molecules. The 3.4 $\mu$m feature indicating a C-H grain
mantle is present in the dust toward HD 204827. The environment of the HD
204827 cloud dust may be similar to the dust associated with HD 62542 which
lies on the edge of a stellar wind bubble and is also dense and rich in
molecules. This sightline may be a Rosetta Stone if its environment can be
related to those in the SMC having similar dust.


Interstellar Polarization in M31

  The wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization due to dust in M31 has
been observed along four sightlines. Only one sightline had been measured
previously.The globular clusters, S78, S150, S233 and Baade 327 were used as
point sources to probe the interstellar dust in M31. The Serkowski law produces
good fits for all the sightlines although the relationship between K and
lambda(max) may be different from that found in the Galaxy. The results of this
study imply that the slope K/lambda(max) may be significantly larger in M31.
The Serkowski curves are significantly narrower than those of the same
lambda(max) in the Galaxy and may require extreme modifications to the size
distributions of silicate particles. The fits for the four sightlines reveal
values of lambda(max) ranging from 4800 to 5500 A. These are consistent with
average values of lambda(max) measured in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.
The range measured for M31 corresponds to R(V) values of 2.7 to 3.1. The range
in R(V) seen in the Galaxy is 2.5 to 5.5 implying, for this small sample, that
the average size ofinterstellar grains in M31 is typically smaller than that
seen for Galactic grains if the nature of the grains is the same. Also, the
polarization efficiency for these sightlines is large although some bias is
expected since sightlines known to have significant interstellar polarization
were selected for the sample.


An Extremely Large Excess of 18O in the Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Star,
  HD 137613

  We report the discovery of a uniquely large excess of 18O in the
hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, HD 137613, based on a spectrum of the
first overtone bands of CO at 2.3-2.4 micron in which three strong absorption
bands of 12C18O are clearly present. Bands of 12C16O also are present but no
bands of 13C16O or 12C17O are seen. We estimate an isotopic ratio 16O/18O ~1.
The Solar value of this ratio is ~500. Neither He-core burning nor He-shell
flash burning can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed in
HD 137613. However, a remarkable similarity exists between the observed
abundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad He-shell of
early-AGB stars, soon after the end of He-core burning. It is not known how the
outer envelope down to the He-shell could be lost but some mechanism of
enhanced mass loss must be involved. HD 137613 may be a post-early-AGB star
with the outer layers of the former He-burning shell as its photosphere.
  The unusual elemental abundances of the HdC stars resemble those of the R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars, but HdC stars do not produce clouds of dust that
produce declines in brightness. None of the other RCB or HdC stars observed
shows significant 18O.


New Ultraviolet Extinction Curves for Interstellar Dust in M31

  New low-resolution UV spectra of a sample of reddened OB stars in M31 were
obtained with HST/STIS to study the wavelength dependence of interstellar
extinction and the nature of the underlying dust grain populations. Extinction
curves were constructed for four reddened sightlines in M31 paired with closely
matching stellar atmosphere models. The new curves have a much higher S/N than
previous studies. Direct measurements of N(H I) were made using the Ly$\alpha$
absorption lines enabling gas-to-dust ratios to be calculated. The sightlines
have a range in galactocentric distance of 5 to 14 kpc and represent dust from
regions of different metallicities and gas-to-dust ratios. The metallicities
sampled range from Solar to 1.5 Solar. The measured curves show similarity to
those seen in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Maximum Entropy
Method was used to investigate the dust composition and size distribution for
the sightlines observed in this program finding that the extinction curves can
be produced with the available carbon and silicon abundances if the metallicity
is super-Solar.


Magellanic-Cloud-Type Interstellar Dust Along Low Density Sightlines in
  the Galaxy

  We have studied the UV extinction properties along 30 Galactic sightlines
using data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) archive that have
never been previously examined. These distant (d > 1 kpc) sightlines were
selected to investigate the distribution and physical conditions of gas located
in low density regions of the Galactic disk and halo. The average densities
along these sightlines are extremely low. It is likely that they are dominated
by the warm intercloud medium and have little contribution from the cold cloud
medium. We find that a subsample of these sightlines has extinction curves with
weak bumps and very steep far-UV extinction reminiscent of the Magellanic
clouds. These sightlines all lie in the region bounded by 325 < l < 0 and -5 >
b > -11. The gas along these sightlines shows forbidden velocities which may
indicate that the dust has been subject to shocks. This type of low density
sightline may mimic the environments found in the Magellanic Clouds. Large
values of N(Ca II)/N(Na I) indicating low depletion are associated with steep
far-UV extinction. A possible correlation exists between decreasing bump
strength and increasing far-UV steepness for extinction curves in the Galaxy
and the Magellanic Clouds.


A Reduction of Imitation Learning and Structured Prediction to No-Regret
  Online Learning

  Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future
observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common
i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance
in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger
guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train
either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of
iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a
stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in
an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined
with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance
under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings.
We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two
challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling
problem.


Embedding parameters in ab initio theory to develop well-controlled
  approximations based on molecular similarity

  A means to take advantage of molecular similarity to lower the computational
cost of electronic structure theory is proposed, in which parameters are
embedded into a low-cost, low-level (LL) ab initio theory and adjusted to
obtain agreement with a higher level (HL) ab initio theory. This approach is
explored by training such a model on data for ethane and testing the resulting
model on methane, propane and butane. The electronic distribution of the
molecules is varied by placing them in strong electrostatic environments
consisting of random charges placed on the corners of a cube. The results find
that parameters embedded in HF/STO-3G theory can be adjusted to obtain
agreement, to within about 2 kcal/mol, with results of HF/6-31G theory.
Obtaining this level of agreement requires the use of parameters that are
functions of the bond lengths, atomic charges, and bond orders within the
molecules. The argument is made that this approach provides a well-controlled
means to take advantage of molecular similarity in quantum chemistry.


Constant Size Molecular Descriptors For Use With Machine Learning

  A set of molecular descriptors whose length is independent of molecular size
is developed for machine learning models that target thermodynamic and
electronic properties of molecules. These features are evaluated by monitoring
performance of kernel ridge regression models on well-studied data sets of
small organic molecules. The features include connectivity counts, which
require only the bonding pattern of the molecule, and encoded distances, which
summarize distances between both bonded and non-bonded atoms and so require the
full molecular geometry. In addition to having constant size, these features
summarize information regarding the local environment of atoms and bonds, such
that models can take advantage of similarities resulting from the presence of
similar chemical fragments across molecules. Combining these two types of
features leads to models whose performance is comparable to or better than the
current state of the art. The features introduced here have the advantage of
leading to models that may be trained on smaller molecules and then used
successfully on larger molecules.


Deeply AggreVaTeD: Differentiable Imitation Learning for Sequential
  Prediction

  Researchers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in sequential
decision making problems (e.g., robotics control, sequential prediction) with
deep neural network models. One often has access to near-optimal oracles that
achieve good performance on the task during training. We demonstrate that
AggreVaTeD --- a policy gradient extension of the Imitation Learning (IL)
approach of (Ross & Bagnell, 2014) --- can leverage such an oracle to achieve
faster and better solutions with less training data than a less-informed
Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique. Using both feedforward and recurrent
neural network predictors, we present stochastic gradient procedures on a
sequential prediction task, dependency-parsing from raw image data, as well as
on various high dimensional robotics control problems. We also provide a
comprehensive theoretical study of IL that demonstrates we can expect up to
exponentially lower sample complexity for learning with AggreVaTeD than with RL
algorithms, which backs our empirical findings. Our results and theory indicate
that the proposed approach can achieve superior performance with respect to the
oracle when the demonstrator is sub-optimal.


Dual Policy Iteration

  Recently, a novel class of Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms have
demonstrated impressive practical performance (e.g., ExIt from [2],
AlphaGo-Zero from [27]). This new family of algorithms maintains, and
alternately optimizes, two policies: a fast, reactive policy (e.g., a deep
neural network) deployed at test time, and a slow, non-reactive policy (e.g.,
Tree Search), that can plan multiple steps ahead. The reactive policy is
updated under supervision from the non-reactive policy, while the non-reactive
policy is improved with guidance from the reactive policy. In this work we
study this Dual Policy Iteration (DPI) strategy in an alternating optimization
framework and provide a convergence analysis that extends existing API theory.
We also develop a special instance of this framework which reduces the update
of non-reactive policies to model-based optimal control using learned local
models, and provides a theoretically sound way of unifying model-free and
model-based RL approaches with unknown dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach on various continuous control Markov Decision Processes.


FUSE Measurements of Far-Ultraviolet Extinction. III. The Dependence on
  R(V) and Discrete Feature Limits from 75 Galactic Sightlines

  We present a sample of 75 extinction curves derived from FUSE far-ultraviolet
spectra supplemented by existing IUE spectra. The extinction curves were
created using the standard pair method based on a new set of dereddened
FUSE+IUE comparison stars. Molecular hydrogen absorption features were removed
using individualized H_2 models for each sightline. The general shape of the
FUSE extinction (8.4 micron^-1 < lambda^-1 < 11 micron^-1) was found to be
broadly consistent with extrapolations from the IUE extinction (3.3 micron-1 <
lambda^-1 < 8.6 micron^-1) curve. Significant differences were seen in the
strength of the far-UV rise and the width of the 2175 A bump. All the FUSE+IUE
extinction curves had positive far-UV slopes giving no indication that the
far-UV rise was turning over at the shortest wavelengths. The dependence of
A(lambda)/A(V) versus R(V)^-1 in the far-UV using the sightlines in our sample
was found to be stronger than tentatively indicated by previous work. We
present an updated R(V) dependent relationship for the full UV wavelength range
(3.3 micron^-1 <= lambda^-1 <= 11 micron^-1). Finally, we searched for discrete
absorption features in the far-ultraviolet. We found a 3 sigma upper limit of
~0.12 A(V) on features with a resolution of 250 (~4 A width) and 3 sigma upper
limits of ~0.15 A(V) for lambda^-1 < 9.6 micron^-1 and ~0.68 A(V) for lambda^-1
> 9.6 micron^-1 on features with a resolution of 10^4 (~0.1 A width).


Closing the Learning-Planning Loop with Predictive State Representations

  A central problem in artificial intelligence is that of planning to maximize
future reward under uncertainty in a partially observable environment. In this
paper we propose and demonstrate a novel algorithm which accurately learns a
model of such an environment directly from sequences of action-observation
pairs. We then close the loop from observations to actions by planning in the
learned model and recovering a policy which is near-optimal in the original
environment. Specifically, we present an efficient and statistically consistent
spectral algorithm for learning the parameters of a Predictive State
Representation (PSR). We demonstrate the algorithm by learning a model of a
simulated high-dimensional, vision-based mobile robot planning task, and then
perform approximate point-based planning in the learned PSR. Analysis of our
results shows that the algorithm learns a state space which efficiently
captures the essential features of the environment. This representation allows
accurate prediction with a small number of parameters, and enables successful
and efficient planning.


A Spectral Learning Approach to Range-Only SLAM

  We present a novel spectral learning algorithm for simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM) from range data with known correspondences. This algorithm
is an instance of a general spectral system identification framework, from
which it inherits several desirable properties, including statistical
consistency and no local optima. Compared with popular batch optimization or
multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) methods for range-only SLAM, our spectral
approach offers guaranteed low computational requirements and good tracking
performance. Compared with popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) or extended
information filter (EIF) approaches, and many MHT ones, our approach does not
need to linearize a transition or measurement model; such linearizations can
cause severe errors in EKFs and EIFs, and to a lesser extent MHT, particularly
for the highly non-Gaussian posteriors encountered in range-only SLAM. We
provide a theoretical analysis of our method, including finite-sample error
bounds. Finally, we demonstrate on a real-world robotic SLAM problem that our
algorithm is not only theoretically justified, but works well in practice: in a
comparison of multiple methods, the lowest errors come from a combination of
our algorithm with batch optimization, but our method alone produces nearly as
good a result at far lower computational cost.


Allen Telescope Array Multi-Frequency Observations of the Sun

  We present the first observations of the Sun with the Allen Telescope Array
(ATA). We used up to six frequencies, from 1.43 to 6 GHz, and baselines from 6
to 300 m. To our knowledge, these are the first simultaneous multifrequency
full-Sun maps obtained at microwave frequencies without mosaicing. The
observations took place when the Sun was relatively quiet, although at least
one active region was present each time. We present multi-frequency flux
budgets for each sources on the Sun. Outside of active regions, assuming
optically thin bremsstrahlung (free--free) coronal emission on top of an
optically thick ~10 000 K chromosphere, the multi-frequency information can be
condensed into a single, frequency-independent, "coronal bremsstrahlung
contribution function" [EM/sqrt(T)] map. This technique allows the separation
of the physics of emission as well as a measurement of the density structure of
the corona. Deviations from this simple relationship usually indicate the
presence of an additional gyroresonance-emission component, as is typical in
active regions.


Two-Manifold Problems

  Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning
manifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some
successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to
noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which
we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a
different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning
problems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold
algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each
view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way
that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear}
dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for
two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance
operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold
problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can
aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.


An Efficient, Expressive and Local Minima-free Method for Learning
  Controlled Dynamical Systems

  We propose a framework for modeling and estimating the state of controlled
dynamical systems, where an agent can affect the system through actions and
receives partial observations. Based on this framework, we propose the
Predictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFFPSR). A key
property in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditional
distribution of future observations given future actions. RFF-PSRs combine this
representation with moment-matching, kernel embedding and local optimization to
achieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can represent
controlled environments which can be affected by actions; it has an efficient
and theoretically justified learning algorithm; it uses a non-parametric
representation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-linear
dynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and an
experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.


Unsupervised Learning for Nonlinear PieceWise Smooth Hybrid Systems

  This paper introduces a novel system identification and tracking method for
PieceWise Smooth (PWS) nonlinear stochastic hybrid systems. We are able to
correctly identify and track challenging problems with diverse dynamics and low
dimensional transitions. We exploit the composite structure system to learn a
simpler model on each component/mode. We use Gaussian Process Regression
techniques to learn smooth, nonlinear manifolds across mode transitions,
guard-regions, and make multi-step ahead predictions on each mode dynamics. We
combine a PWS non-linear model with a particle filter to effectively track
multi-modal transitions. We further use synthetic oversampling techniques to
address the challenge of detecting mode transition which is sparse compared to
mode dynamics. This work provides an effective form of model learning in a
complex hybrid system, which can be useful for future integration in a
reinforcement learning setting. We compare multi-step prediction and tracking
performance against traditional dynamical system tracking methods, such as EKF
and Switching Gaussian Processes, and show that this framework performs
significantly better, being able to correctly track complex dynamics with
sparse transitions.


An Empirical Study of Example Forgetting during Deep Neural Network
  Learning

  Inspired by the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, we investigate the
learning dynamics of neural networks as they train on single classification
tasks. Our goal is to understand whether a related phenomenon occurs when data
does not undergo a clear distributional shift. We define a `forgetting event'
to have occurred when an individual training example transitions from being
classified correctly to incorrectly over the course of learning. Across several
benchmark data sets, we find that: (i) certain examples are forgotten with high
frequency, and some not at all; (ii) a data set's (un)forgettable examples
generalize across neural architectures; and (iii) based on forgetting dynamics,
a significant fraction of examples can be omitted from the training data set
while still maintaining state-of-the-art generalization performance.


The Circumstellar Environment of R Coronae Borealis: White Dwarf Merger
  or Final Helium Shell Flash?

  In 2007, R Coronae Borealis (R CrB) went into an historically deep and long
decline. In this state, the dust acts like a natural coronagraph at visible
wavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. Imaging has
been obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with Gemini/GMOS, HST/WFPC2, Spitzer/MIPS,
and Herschel/SPIRE. Several of the structures around R CrB are cometary
globules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. The estimated
dust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the R CrB
declines if they form along the line of sight to the star. In addition, there
is a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containing
cool 25 K dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. The SED of R CrB
can be well fit by a 150 AU disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelope
which corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. The total masses of
the disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 M(Sun), respectively, assuming a
gas-to-dust ratio of 100. The evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger or
a final-helium-shell flash origin for R CrB is contradictory. The shell and the
cometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. Along with the
fact that R CrB shows significant Lithium in its atmosphere, this supports the
final-helium-shell flash. However, the relatively high inferred mass of R CrB
and its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.


The MACHO Project LMC Variable Star Inventory: X. The R Coronae Borealis
  Stars

  We report the discovery of eight new R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the MACHO project photometry database. The
discovery of these new stars increases the number of known RCB stars in the LMC
to thirteen. We have also discovered four stars similar to the Galactic
variable DY Per. These stars decline much more slowly and are cooler than the
RCB stars. The absolute luminosities of the Galactic RCB stars are unknown
since there is no direct measurement of the distance to any Galactic RCB star.
Hence, the importance of the LMC RCB stars. We find a much larger range of
absolute magnitudes (M(V) = -2.5 to -5 mag) than inferred from the small
pre-MACHO sample of LMC RCB stars. It is likely that there is a temperature -
M(V)relationship with the cooler stars being intrinsically fainter. Cool (~5000
K) RCB stars are much more common than previously thought based on the Galactic
RCB star sample. Using the fairly complete sample of RCB stars discovered in
the MACHO fields, we have estimated the likely number of RCB stars in the
Galaxy to be ~3,200. The SMC MACHO fields were also searched for RCB stars but
none were found.


Measuring Extinction Curves of Lensing Galaxies

  We critique the method of constructing extinction curves of lensing galaxies
using multiply imaged QSOs. If one of the two QSO images is lightly reddened or
if the dust along both sightlines has the same properties then the method works
well and produces an extinction curve for the lensing galaxy. These cases are
likely rare and hard to confirm. However, if the dust along each sightline has
different properties then the resulting curve is no longer a measurement of
extinction. Instead, it is a measurement of the difference between two
extinction curves. This "lens difference curve'' does contain information about
the dust properties, but extracting a meaningful extinction curve is not
possible without additional, currently unknown information. As a quantitative
example, we show that the combination of two Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (CCM)
type extinction curves having different values of R(V) will produce a CCM
extinction curve with a value of R(V) which is dependent on the individual R(V)
values and the ratio of V band extinctions. The resulting lens difference curve
is not an average of the dust along the two sightlines. We find that lens
difference curves with any value of R(V), even negative values, can be produced
by a combination of two reddened sightlines with different CCM extinction
curves with R(V) values consistent with Milky Way dust (2.1 < R(V) < 5.6). This
may explain extreme values of R(V) inferred by this method in previous studies.
But lens difference curves with more normal values of R(V) are just as likely
to be composed of two dust extinction curves with R(V) values different than
that of the lens difference curve. While it is not possible to determine the
individual extinction curves making up a lens difference curve, there is
information about a galaxy's dust contained in the lens difference curves.
