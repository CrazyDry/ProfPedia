Toward Trusted Sharing of Network Packet Traces Using Anonymization:  Single-Field Privacy/Analysis Tradeoffs

  Network data needs to be shared for distributed security analysis.Anonymization of network data for sharing sets up a fundamental tradeoffbetween privacy protection versus security analysis capability. Thisprivacy/analysis tradeoff has been acknowledged by many researchers but this isthe first paper to provide empirical measurements to characterize theprivacy/analysis tradeoff for an enterprise dataset. Specifically we performanonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and thenmake measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy forsecurity analysis capability. Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sumtradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eightfields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which bothprivacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.

Adaptive Image Stream Classification via Convolutional Neural Network  with Intrinsic Similarity Metrics

  When performing data classification over a stream of continuously occurringinstances, a key challenge is to develop an open-world classifier thatanticipates instances from an unknown class. Studies addressing this problem,typically called novel class detection, have considered classification methodsthat reactively adapt to such changes along the stream. Importantly, they relyon the property of cohesion and separation among instances in feature space.Instances belonging to the same class are assumed to be closer to each other(cohesion) than those belonging to different classes (separation).Unfortunately, this assumption may not have large support when dealing withhigh dimensional data such as images. In this paper, we address this keychallenge by proposing a semisupervised multi-task learning framework calledCSIM which aims to intrinsically search for a latent space suitable fordetecting labels of instances from both known and unknown classes.Particularly, we utilize a convolution neural network layer that aids in thelearning of a latent feature space suitable for novel class detection. Weempirically measure the performance of CSIM over multiple realworld imagedatasets and demonstrate its superiority by comparing its performance withexisting semi-supervised methods.

Cause Identification from Aviation Safety Incident Reports via Weakly  Supervised Semantic Lexicon Construction

  The Aviation Safety Reporting System collects voluntarily submitted reportson aviation safety incidents to facilitate research work aiming to reduce suchincidents. To effectively reduce these incidents, it is vital to accuratelyidentify why these incidents occurred. More precisely, given a set of possiblecauses, or shaping factors, this task of cause identification involvesidentifying all and only those shaping factors that are responsible for theincidents described in a report. We investigate two approaches to causeidentification. Both approaches exploit information provided by a semanticlexicon, which is automatically constructed via Thelen and Riloffs Basiliskframework augmented with our linguistic and algorithmic modifications. Thefirst approach labels a report using a simple heuristic, which looks for thewords and phrases acquired during the semantic lexicon learning process in thereport. The second approach recasts cause identification as a textclassification problem, employing supervised and transductive textclassification algorithms to learn models from incident reports labeled withshaping factors and using the models to label unseen reports. Our experimentsshow that both the heuristic-based approach and the learning-based approach(when given sufficient training data) outperform the baseline systemsignificantly.

Co-Representation Learning For Classification and Novel Class Detection  via Deep Networks

  One of the key challenges of performing label prediction over a data streamconcerns with the emergence of instances belonging to unobserved class labelsover time. Previously, this problem has been addressed by detecting suchinstances and using them for appropriate classifier adaptation. The fundamentalaspect of a novel-class detection strategy relies on the ability of comparisonamong observed instances to discriminate them into known and unknown classes.Therefore, studies in the past have proposed various metrics suitable forcomparison over the observed feature space. Unfortunately, these similaritymeasures fail to reliably identify distinct regions in observed feature spacesuseful for class discrimination and novel-class detection, especially instreams containing high-dimensional data instances such as images and texts. Inthis paper, we address this key challenge by proposing a semi-supervisedmulti-task learning framework called \sysname{} which aims to intrinsicallysearch for a latent space suitable for detecting labels of instances from bothknown and unknown classes. We empirically measure the performance of \sysname{}over multiple real-world image and text datasets and demonstrate itssuperiority by comparing its performance with existing semi-supervised methods.
