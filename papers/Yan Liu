The extraction of nuclear sea quark distribution and energy loss effect  in Drell-Yan experiment

  The next-to-leading order and leading order analysis are performed on thedifferential cross section ratio from Drell-Yan process. It is found that theeffect of next-to-leading order corrections can be negligible on thedifferential cross section ratios as a function of the quark momentum fractionin the beam proton and the target nuclei for the current Fermilab and futurelower beam proton energy. The nuclear Drell-Yan reaction is an ideal tool tostudy the energy loss of the fast quark moving through cold nuclei. In theleading order analysis, the theoretical results with quark energy loss are ingood agreement with the Fermilab E866 experimental data on the Drell-Yandifferential cross section ratios as a function of the momentum fraction of thetarget parton. It is shown that the quark energy loss effect has significantimpact on the Drell-Yan differential cross section ratios. The nuclearDrell-Yan experiment at current Fermilab and future lower energy proton beamcan not provide us with more information on the nuclear sea quark distribution.

Incidence Matrices of Finite Quadratic Spaces

  In this paper, we first prove the 2-rank of full incidence matrix of PG(n,q)with $q$ an odd prime power. Then by the quadratic form defined on PG(n,q), thepoints of it are classified as isotropic and anisotropic points. We divide thefull incidence matrix into four sub-matrices. Then by using the softwarepackage Magma, we give a general conjecture for the 2-rank of sub-matrices ofthe full incidence matrix in PG(n,q) and prove it in the case of n=1, 2.

Incidence Matrices of Polarized Projective Spaces

  In this paper, we first define a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form onFq^4. Then we get an incidence matrix G of Fq^4 by the bilinear form. By itscorresponding quadratic form Q, the lines of Fq^4 are classified as isotropicand anisotropic lines. Under this classification, we can get two sub-matricesof G and prove their 2-rank. Key words and phrases: finite field, quadraticform, incidence matrix.

Cyclic Codes from Two-Prime Generalized Cyclotomic Sequences of Order 6

  Cyclic codes have wide applications in data storage systems and communicationsystems. Employing two-prime Whiteman generalized cyclotomic sequences of order6, we construct several classes of cyclic codes over the finite field GF}(q)and give their generator polynomials. And we also calculate the minimumdistance of some cyclic codes and give lower bounds of the minimum distance forsome other cyclic codes.

Generative Steganography by Sampling

  In this paper, a new data-driven information hiding scheme called generativesteganography by sampling (GSS) is proposed. The stego is directly sampled by apowerful generator without an explicit cover. Secret key shared by both partiesis used for message embedding and extraction, respectively. Jensen-ShannonDivergence is introduced as new criteria for evaluation of the security of thegenerative steganography. Based on these principles, a simple practicalgenerative steganography method is proposed using semantic image inpainting.Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative andquantitative evaluation of the generated stego images.

Bose-Fermi competition in holographic metals

  We study the holographic dual of a finite density system with both bosonicand fermionic degrees of freedom. There is no evidence for a universalbose-dominated ground state. Instead, depending on the relative conformalweights the preferred groundstate is either pure AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom, aholographic superconductor, an electron star, or a novel mixed state that isbest characterized as a hairy electron star.

Vortex gyration mediated by spin waves driven by an out-of-plane  oscillating magnetic field

  In this letter we address the vortex core dynamics involved in gyrationexcitation and damping change by out-of-plane oscillating magnetic fields. Whenthe vortex core is at rest under the effect of in-plane bias magnetic fields,the spin waves excited by the perpendicular magnetic field can induce obviousvortex gyration. When simultaneously excite spin waves and vortex gyrotropicmotion, the gyration damping changes. Analysis of the system energy allows usto explain the origin of the spin-wave-mediated vortex gyration.

The holographic Weyl semi-metal

  We present a holographic model of a Weyl semi-metal. We show that uponvarying a mass parameter the model undergoes a quantum phase transition from atopologically non-trivial state to a trivial one. The order parameter for thisphase transition is the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We give an interpretationof the results in terms of a holographic RG flow and compare to a weaklycoupled field theoretical model. Since there are no quasiparticle excitationsin the strongly coupled holographic model the topological phase can not bebound to notions of topology in momentum space.

Quantile tests in frequency domain for sinusoid models

  For second order stationary processes, the spectral distribution function isuniquely deter- mined by the autocovariance functions of the processes. Wedefine the quantiles of the spectral distribution function and propose twoestimators for the quantiles. Asymptotic properties of both estimators areelucidated and the difference from the quantile estimators in time do- main isalso indicated. We construct a testing procedure of quantile tests from theasymptotic distribution of the estimators and strong statistical power is shownin our numerical studies.

Challenges Towards Deploying Data Intensive Scientific Applications on  Extreme Heterogeneity Supercomputers

  Shrinking transistors, which powered the advancement of computing in the pasthalf century, has stalled due to power wall; now extreme heterogeneity ispromised to be the next driving force to feed the needs of ever-increasinglydiverse scientific domains. To unlock the potentials of such supercomputers, weidentify eight potential challenges in three categories: First, one needs fastdata movement since extreme heterogeneity will inevitably complicate thecommunication circuits -- thus hampering the data movement. Second, we need tointelligently schedule suitable hardware for corresponding applications/stages.Third, we have to lower the programming complexity in order to encourage theadoption of heterogeneous computing.

Weyl semimetal/insulator transition from holography

  We study a holographic model which exhibits a quantum phase transition fromthe strongly interacting Weyl semimetal phase to an insulating phase. In theholographic insulating phase there is a hard gap in the real part of frequencydependent diagonal conductivities. However, the anomalous Hall conductivity isnonzero at zero frequency, indicting that it is a Chern insulator. Thisholographic quantum phase transition is always of first order, signified by adiscontinuous anomalous Hall conductivity at the phase transition, in contrastto the very continuous holographic Weyl semimetal/trivial semimetal phasetransition. Our work reveals the novel phase structure of strongly interactingWeyl semimetal.

  A two-dimensional (2D) mathematical model of quadratically distorted (QD)grating is established with the principles of Fraunhofer diffraction andFourier optics. Discrete sampling and bisection algorithm are applied forfinding numerical solution of the diffraction pattern of QD grating. This 2Dmathematical model allows the precise design of QD grating and improves theoptical performance of simultaneous multiplane imaging system.

Glauber Gluons in Soft Collinear Effective Theory and Factorization of  Drell-Yan Processes

  Glauber gluons in Drell-Yan processes are soft gluons with the transversemomenta much larger than their momentum components along the directions ofinitial hadrons. Their existence has been a serious challenge in proving thefactorization of Drell-Yan processes. The recently proposed soft collineareffect theory of QCD can provide a transparent way to show factorizations for aclass of processes, but it does not address the effect of glauber gluons. Inthis letter we first confirm the existence of glauber gluons through anexample. We then add glauber gluons into the effective theory and study theirinteraction with other particles. In the framework of the effective theory withglauber gluons we are able to show that the effects of glauber gluons inDrell-Yan processes are canceled and the factorization holds in the existenceof glauber gluons. Our work completes the proof or argument of factorization ofDrell-Yan process in the framework of the soft collinear effective theory.

The uncertainties due to quark energy loss on determining nuclear sea  quark distribution from nuclear Drell-Yan data

  By means of two different parametrizations of quark energy loss and thenuclear parton distributions determined only with lepton-nuclear deep inelasticscattering experimental data, a leading order phenomenological analysis isperformed on the nuclear Drell-Yan differential cross section ratios as afunction of the quark momentum fraction in the beam proton and target nucleifor E772 experimental data. It is shown that there is the quark energy losseffect in nuclear Drell-Yan process apart from the nuclear effects on theparton distribution as in deep inelastic scattering. The uncertainties due toquark energy loss effect is quantified on determining nuclear sea quarkdistribution by using nuclear Drell-Yan data. It is found that the quark energyloss effect on nuclear Drell-Yan cross section ratios make greater with theincrease of quark momentum fraction in the target nuclei. The uncertaintiesfrom quark energy loss become bigger as the nucleus A come to be heavier. TheDrell-Yan data on proton incident middle and heavy nuclei versus deuteriumwould result in an overestimate for nuclear modifications on sea quarkdistribution functions with neglecting the quark energy loss. Our results arehoped to provide good directional information on the magnitude and form ofnuclear modifications on sea quark distribution functions by means of thenuclear Drell-Yan experimental data.

Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductors in Born-Infeld electrodynamics  with backreactions

  We develop a general holographic superconductor away from the probe limit byconsidering the corrections both in the gravity and in the gauge matter fields.We find the consistent effects of the high curvature correction in the gravity,the nonlinear correction in the gauge matter field and the backreaction on thedynamics of bulk AdS background and boundary CFT. They all have the effect toprotect the stability of the bulk spacetime and hinder the formation of thescalar hair condensation on the boundary.

Prospects of polarized fixed target Drell-Yan experiments

  It has been proposed that the Siverse transverse single spin asymmetry inDrell-Yan production in transversely polarized p+p collisions would have anopposite sign compared to what has been observed in the polarizedSemi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) experiments. Experimentalconfirmation or disproval of this prediction would provide a new fundamentaltest of QCD and shed new light on our theoretical understanding of thetransverse spin physics phenomena. We discuss the prospects and physicssensitivities of polarized fixed target Drell-Yan experiments that couldutilize the existing proton and other hadron beams at Fermilab, and polarizedproton beams at RHIC with a polarized solid proton and/or neutron targetoption. We show that if realized, the new experiments would provide criticalmeasurements of not only the sign change (or not) of Sivers functions, but alsothe information of quark and antiquark's Sivers distributions over a widekinematic range.

Bosonic Integer Quantum Hall States without Landau Levels on Square  Lattice

  We study an interacting two-component hard-core bosons on square lattice forwhich, in the presence of staggered magnetic flux, the ground state is abosonic integer quantum Hall (BIQH) state. Using a coupled-wire bosonizationapproach, we analytically show this model exhibits a BIQH state at total chargehalf filling associated with a symmetry-protected topological phase under$U(1)$ charge conservation. These theoretical expectations are verified, usingthe infinite density matrix renormalization group method, by providingnumerical evidences for: (i) a quantized Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}=\pm2$,and (ii) two counter-propagating gapless edge modes. Our model is a bosoniccousin of the fermionic Haldane model and serves as an additional case ofanalogy between bosonic and fermionic quantum Hall states.

The influence of quark energy loss on extracting nuclear sea quark  distribution from nuclear Drell-Yan experimental data

  By means of two typical kinds of quark energy loss parametrization and thenuclear parton distributions determined only with lepton-nuclear deep inelasticscattering experimental data, a leading order analysis are performed on theproton-induced Drell-Yan differential cross section ratios of tungsten versusdeuterium as a function of the quark momentum fraction in the beam proton andtarget nuclei. It is found that the theoretical results with quark energy lossare in good agreement with the experimental data. The quark energy loss effectproduce approximately 3% to 11% suppression on the Drell-Yan differential crosssection ratios $R_{W/D}$ in the range $0.05\leq x_2\leq0.3$. The application ofnuclear Drell-Yan data with heavy targets is remarkably subject to difficultyin the constraints of the nuclear sea-quark distribution.

Next-to-leading Order Parton Model Calculations in the Massless  Schwinger Model

  We carry out next-to-leading order (NLO) parton model calculations for thestandard hard ``QCD'' processes in the massless Schwinger model. The asymptoticexpansion of the exact result for the deep inelastic cross section is used toinfer the NLO distribution function. These distribution functions are then usedto calculate the NLO Drell-Yan parton model cross section and it is found toagree with the corresponding term in the expansion of the exact result for theDrell-Yan cross section. Finally, by using the bosonization formula and theexact solutions we study the interference between different partonic processes.

1/m_Q Corrections to the Heavy-to-Light-Vector Transitions in the HQET

  Within the HQET, the heavy to light vector meson transitions aresystematically analyzed to the order of 1/m_Q. Besides the four universalfunctions at the leading order, there are twenty-two independent universal formfactors at the order of 1/m_Q. Both the semileptonic decay B->\rho which isrelevant to the |V_{ub}| extraction, and the penguin induced decay B -> K^*which is important to new physics discovering, depend on these form factors.Phenomenological implications are discussed.

Solid superheating observed in two-dimensional strongly-coupled dusty  plasma

  It is demonstrated experimentally that strongly-coupled plasma exhibits solidsuperheating. A 2D suspension of microspheres in dusty plasma, initiallyself-organized in a solid lattice, was heated and then cooled rapidly byturning laser heating on and off. Particles were tracked using videomicroscopy, allowing atomistic-scale observation during melting andsolidification. During rapid heating, the suspension remained in a solidstructure at temperatures above the melting point, demonstrating solidsuperheating. Hysteresis diagrams did not indicate liquid supercooling in this2D system.

Density of eigenvalues and its perturbation invariance in unitary  ensembles of random matrices

  We generally study the density of eigenvalues in unitary ensembles of randommatrices from the recurrence coefficients with regularly varying conditions forthe orthogonal polynomials. First we calculate directly the moments of thedensity. Then, by studying some deformation of the moments, we get a family ofdifferential equations of first order which the densities satisfy (see Theorem1.2), and give the densities by solving them. Further, we prove that thedensity is invariant after the polynomial perturbation of the weight function(see Theorem 1.5).

Evolution of shear-induced melting in dusty plasma

  The spatiotemporal development of melting is studied experimentally in a 2Ddusty plasma suspension. Starting with an ordered lattice, and then suddenlyapplying localized shear, a pair of counter-propagating flow regions develop. Atransition between two melting stages is observed before a steady state isreached. Melting spreads with a front that propagates at the transverse soundspeed. Unexpectedly, coherent longitudinal waves are excited in the flowregion.

Viscoelasticity of 2D liquids quantified in a dusty plasma experiment

  The viscoelasticity of two-dimensional liquids is quantified in an experimentusing a dusty plasma. An experimental method is demonstrated for measuring thewavenumber-dependent viscosity, $\eta(k)$, which is a quantitative indicator ofviscoelasticity. Using an expression generalized here to include friction,$\eta(k)$ is computed from the transverse current autocorrelation function(TCAF), which is found by tracking random particle motion. The TCAF exhibits anoscillation that is a signature of elastic contributions to viscoelasticity.Simulations of a Yukawa liquid are consistent with the experiment.

Rapid heating and cooling in two-dimensional Yukawa systems

  Simulations are reported to investigate solid superheating and liquidsupercooling of two-dimensional (2D) systems with a Yukawa interparticlepotential. Motivated by experiments where a dusty plasma is heated and thencooled suddenly, we track particle motion using a simulation with Langevindynamics. Hysteresis is observed when the temperature is varied rapidly in aheating and cooling cycle. As in the experiment, transient solid superheating,but not liquid supercooling, is observed. Solid superheating, which ischaracterized by solid structure above the melting point, is found to bepromoted by a higher rate of temperature increase.

Extraordinary transmission caused by symmetry breaking

  The terahertz transmission properties of symmetrical and asymmetrical annularapertures arrays (AAAs) are investigated both experimentally and numerically.It is found that only odd order resonant modes are observed for the symmetricalstructures but both odd and even order resonances can be shown for theasymmetrical structures. Breaking the symmetry of AAAs by gradually displacingthe H-shaped AAAs to U-shaped AAAs allows an intensity modulation depth of 99%of the second order resonance. Simulation results verify the experimentalconclusions well. This result provides a tremendous opportunity for terahertzwavelength tunable filtering, sensing, and near-field imaging.

Communication-Efficient Parallel Belief Propagation for Latent Dirichlet  Allocation

  This paper presents a novel communication-efficient parallel beliefpropagation (CE-PBP) algorithm for training latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).Based on the synchronous belief propagation (BP) algorithm, we first develop aparallel belief propagation (PBP) algorithm on the parallel architecture.Because the extensive communication delay often causes a low efficiency ofparallel topic modeling, we further use Zipf's law to reduce the totalcommunication cost in PBP. Extensive experiments on different data setsdemonstrate that CE-PBP achieves a higher topic modeling accuracy and reducesmore than 80% communication cost than the state-of-the-art parallel Gibbssampling (PGS) algorithm.

Observation of temperature peaks due to strong viscous heating in a  dusty plasma flow

  Profound temperature peaks are observed in regions of high velocity shear ina 2D dusty plasma experiment with laser-driven flow. These are attributed toviscous heating, which occurs due to collisional scattering in a shear flow.Using measurements of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and spatial profiles offlow velocity and temperature, we determine three dimensionless numbers:Brinkman Br = 0.5, Prandtl Pr = 0.09, and Eckert Ec = 5.7. The large value ofBr indicates significant viscous heating that is consistent with the observedtemperature peaks.

The Bouleau-Yor identity for a bi-fractional Brownian motion

  Let $B$ be a bi-fractional Brownian motion with indices $H\in (0,1),K\in(0,1]$, $2HK=1$ and let ${\mathscr L}(x,t)$ be its local time process. Weconstruct a Banach space ${\mathscr H}$ of measurable functions such that thequadratic covariation $[f(B),B]$ and the integral $\int_{\mathbbR}f(x){\mathscr L}(dx,t)$ exist provided $f\in {\mathscr H}$. Moreover, theBouleau-Yor identity $$ [f(B),B]_t=-2^{1-K}\int_{\mathbb R}f(x){\mathscrL}(dx,t),\qquad t\geq 0, $$ holds for all $f\in {\mathscr H}$.

Longitudinal viscosity of 2D Yukawa liquids

  The longitudinal viscosity $\eta_l$ is obtained for a two-dimensional (2D)liquid using a Green-Kubo method with a molecular dynamics simulation. Theinterparticle potential used has the Debye-H\"{u}ckel or Yukawa form, whichmodels a 2D dusty plasma. The longitudinal $\eta_l$ and shear $\eta_s$viscosities are found to have values that match very closely, with onlynegligible differences for the entire range of temperatures that is considered.The bulk viscosity $\eta_b$ is determined to be either negligibly small or nota meaningful transport coefficient, for a 2D Yukawa liquid.

A type of multiple integral with loggamma function

  In this paper, we study the multiple integral $ \displaystyle I= \int_0^1\int_0^1 \dots \int_0^1 f(x_1+x_2 + \dots +x_n) \, dx_1 \, dx_2 \, \dots \,dx_n$. A general formula of $I$ is presented. As an application, the integral$I$ with $f(x)= \log \Gamma(x)$ is evaluated. We show that the values of $I$share a common formula for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The subsidiary computationalchallenges are substantial and interesting in their own right.

All-optical routing of single photons with multiple input and output  ports by interferences

  We propose a waveguide-cavity coupled system to achieve the routing ofphotons by the phases of other photons. Our router has four input ports andfour output ports. The transport of the coherent-state photons injected throughany input port can be controlled by the phases of the coherent-state photonsinjected through other input ports. This control can be achieved when the meannumbers of the routed and control photons are small enough and require noadditional control fields. Therefore, the all-optical routing of photons can beachieved at the single-photon level.

The effects of delta mesons on the baryonic direct Urca processes in  neutron star matter

  In the framework of relativistic mean field theory, the relativistic neutrinoemissivity of the nucleonic and hyperonic direct Urca processes in thedegenerate baryon matter of neutron stars are studied. We investigateparticularly the influence of the isovector scalar interaction which isconsidered by exchanging $\delta$ meson on the nucleonic and hyperonic directUrca processes. The results indicate that $\delta$ mesons lead to obviousenhancement of the total neutrino emissivity, which must result in more rapidcooling rate of neutron star matter.

Scalar field condensation behaviors around reflecting shells in Anti-de  Sitter spacetimes

  We study scalar condensations around asymptotically Anti-de Sitter(AdS)regular reflecting shells. We show that the charged scalar field can condensearound charged reflecting shells with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundaryconditions. In particular, the radii of the asymptotically AdS hairy shells arediscrete, which is similar to cases in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We alsoprovide upper bounds for the radii of the hairy Dirichlet reflecting shells andabove the bound, the scalar field cannot condense around the shell.

Perfect Optical Nonreciprocity in a Double-Cavity Optomechanical System

  Nonreciprocal devices are indispensable for building quantum networks andubiquitous in modern communication technology. Here, we use optomechanicalinteraction and linearly-coupled interaction to realize optical nonreciprocaltransmission in a double-cavity optomechanical system. The scheme relies on theinterference between the two interactions. We derive the essential conditionsto realize perfect optical nonreciprocity in the system, and analyse theproperties of optical nonreciprocal transmission and the output fields frommechanical mode. These results can be used to control optical transmission inquantum information processing.

Electronic Structures of Graphene Layers on Metal Foil: Effect of Point  Defects

  Here we report a facile method to generate a high density of point defects ingraphene on metal foil and show how the point defects affect the electronicstructures of graphene layers. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)measurements, complemented by first principle calculations, reveal that thepoint defects result in both the intervalley and intravalley scattering ofgraphene. The Fermi velocity is reduced in the vicinity area of the defect dueto the enhanced scattering. Additionally, our analysis further points out thatperiodic point defects can tailor the electronic properties of graphene byintroducing a significant bandgap, which opens an avenue towards all-grapheneelectronics.

  Comment on the paper of Ha and Liu (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79}, 1289 (1997))regarding the nature of attraction between like charged rods. We demostratethat their results do not produce the correct low temperature limit.

Compact Composition Operators on the Bloch Space in Bounded Symmetric  Domains

  Let $\Omega$ be a bounded symmetric domain except the two exceptional domainsof ${\Bbb C}^N$ and $\phi$ a holomorphic self-map of $\Omega.$ This paper givesa sufficient and necessary condition for the composition operator $C_{\phi}$induced by $\phi$ to be compact on the Bloch space $\beta(\Omega)$.

Nonexistence of triples of nonisomorphic connected graphs with  isomorphic connected $P_3$-graphs

  In the paper "Broersma and Hoede, {\it Path graphs}, J. Graph Theory {\bf 13}(1989) 427-444", the authors proposed a problem whether there is a triple ofmutually nonisomorphic connected graphs which have an isomorphic connected$P_3$-graph. For a long time, this problem remains unanswered. In this paper,we give it a negative answer that there is no such triple, and thus completelysolve this problem.

  In this paper, we study almost periodic solutions for semilinear stochasticdifferential equations driven by L\'{e}vy noise with exponential dichotomyproperty. Under suitable conditions on the coefficients, we obtain theexistence and uniqueness of bounded solutions. Furthermore, this unique boundedsolution is almost periodic in distribution under slightly stronger conditions.We also give two examples to illustrate our results.

  Worker selection is a key issue in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). While previousworker selection approaches mainly focus on selecting a proper subset ofworkers for a single MCS task, multi-task-oriented worker selection isessential and useful for the efficiency of large-scale MCS platforms. Thispaper proposes ActiveCrowd, a worker selection framework for multi-task MCSenvironments.

Trace codes over $\Z_4$ and Boolean function

  We construct trace codes over $\Z_4$ by using Boolean functions and skewsets, respectively. Their Lee weight distribution is studied by using a Galoisring version of the Walsh-Hadamard transform and exponential sums. We obtain anew family of optimal two-weight codes over $\Z_4.$
