Enhancing Robustness of Deep Neural Networks Against Adversarial Malware  Samples: Principles, Framework, and AICS'2019 Challenge

  Malware continues to be a major cyber threat, despite the tremendous effortthat has been made to combat them. The number of malware in the wild steadilyincreases over time, meaning that we must resort to automated defensetechniques. This naturally calls for machine learning based malware detection.However, machine learning is known to be vulnerable to adversarial evasionattacks that manipulate a small number of features to make classifiers wronglyrecognize a malware sample as a benign one. The state-of-the-art is that thereare no effective countermeasures against these attacks. Inspired by theAICS'2019 Challenge, we systematize a number of principles for enhancing therobustness of neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. Someof these principles have been scattered in the literature, but others areproposed in this paper for the first time. Under the guidance of theseprinciples, we propose a framework and an accompanying training algorithm,which are then applied to the AICS'2019 challenge. Our experimental resultshave been submitted to the challenge organizer for evaluation.

AiDroid: When Heterogeneous Information Network Marries Deep Neural  Network for Real-time Android Malware Detection

  The explosive growth and increasing sophistication of Android malware callfor new defensive techniques that are capable of protecting mobile usersagainst novel threats. In this paper, we first extract the runtime ApplicationProgramming Interface (API) call sequences from Android apps, and then analyzehigher-level semantic relations within the ecosystem to comprehensivelycharacterize the apps. To model different types of entities (i.e., app, API,IMEI, signature, affiliation) and the rich semantic relations among them, wethen construct a structural heterogeneous information network (HIN) and presentmeta-path based approach to depict the relatedness over apps. To efficientlyclassify nodes (e.g., apps) in the constructed HIN, we propose the HinLearningmethod to first obtain in-sample node embeddings and then learn representationsof out-of-sample nodes without rerunning/adjusting HIN embeddings at the firstattempt. Afterwards, we design a deep neural network (DNN) classifier takingthe learned HIN representations as inputs for Android malware detection. Acomprehensive experimental study on the large-scale real sample collectionsfrom Tencent Security Lab is performed to compare various baselines. Promisingexperimental results demonstrate that our developed system AiDroid whichintegrates our proposed method outperforms others in real-time Android malwaredetection. AiDroid has already been incorporated into Tencent Mobile Securityproduct that serves millions of users worldwide.

Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network

  Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based ondeep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerableresearch interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neuralnetwork for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes andlinks. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challengesfor designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one ofthe most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism,whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In thispaper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on thehierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions.Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between anode and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention isable to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learnedimportance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance ofnode and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model cangenerate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighborsin a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-worldheterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposedmodel over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially goodinterpretability for graph analysis.
