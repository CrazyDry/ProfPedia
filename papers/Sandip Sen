Higher order two-mode and multi-mode entanglement in Raman processes

  The existence of higher order entanglement in the stimulated and spontaneousRaman processes is established using the perturbative solutions of theHeisenberg equations of motion for various field modes that are obtained usingthe Sen-Mandal technique and a fully quantum mechanical Hamiltonian thatdescribes the stimulated and spontaneous Raman processes. Specifically, theperturbative Sen-Mandal solutions are exploited here to show the signature ofthe higher order two-mode and multi-mode entanglement. In some special cases,we have also observed higher order entanglement in the partially spontaneousRaman processes. Further, it is shown that the depth of the nonclassicalityindicators (parameters) can be manipulated by the specific choice of couplingconstants, and it is observed that the depth of nonclassicality parametersincreases with the order.

On local structures of cubicity 2 graphs

  A 2-stab unit interval graph (2SUIG) is an axes-parallel unit squareintersection graph where the unit squares intersect either of the two fixedlines parallel to the $X$-axis, distance $1 + \epsilon$ ($0 < \epsilon < 1$)apart. This family of graphs allow us to study local structures of unit squareintersection graphs, that is, graphs with cubicity 2. The complexity ofdetermining whether a tree has cubicity 2 is unknown while the graphrecognition problem for unit square intersection graph is known to be NP-hard.We present a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing trees that admit a 2SUIGrepresentation.

Oriented Bipartite Graphs and the Goldbach Graph

  In this paper we study oriented bipartite graphs. In particular, severalcharacterizations of bitournaments are obtained. We introduce the concept ofodd-even graphs and show that any (oriented) bipartite graph can be representedby some (oriented) odd-even graph. We show that the famous Goldbach'sconjecture is equivalent to the connectedness of certain odd-even graphs.

Chromatic number of signed graphs with bounded maximum degree

  A signed graph $ (G, \Sigma)$ is a graph positive and negative ($\Sigma $denotes the set of negative edges). To re-sign a vertex $v$ of a signed graph $(G, \Sigma)$ is to switch the signs of the edges incident to $v$. If one canobtain $ (G, \Sigma')$ by re-signing some vertices of $ (G, \Sigma)$, then  $ (G, \Sigma) \equiv (G, \Sigma')$.  A signed graphs $ (G, \Sigma )$ admits an homomorphism to $ (H, \Lambda )$ ifthere is a sign preserving vertex mapping from $(G,\Sigma')$ to $(H, \Lambda)$for some $ (G, \Sigma) \equiv (G, \Sigma')$.  The signed chromatic number $\chi_{s}( (G, \Sigma))$ of the signed graph $(G,\Sigma)$ is the minimum order (number of vertices) of a signed graph $(H,\Lambda)$ such that $ (G, \Sigma)$ admits a homomorphism to $(H, \Lambda)$. Fora family $ \mathcal{F}$ of signed graphs $\chi_{s}(\mathcal{F}) =\text{max}_{(G,\Sigma) \in \mathcal{F}} \chi_{s}( (G, \Sigma))$.  We prove $2^{\Delta/2-1} \leq \chi_s(\mathcal{G}_{\Delta}) \leq (\Delta-1)^2.2^{(\Delta-1)} +2$ for all $\Delta \geq 3$ where $\mathcal{G}_{\Delta}$ is thefamily of connected signed graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$. \end{abstract}

Rotating Attractors

  We prove that, in a general higher derivative theory of gravity coupled toabelian gauge fields and neutral scalar fields, the entropy and the nearhorizon background of a rotating extremal black hole is obtained by extremizingan entropy function which depends only on the parameters labeling the nearhorizon background and the electric and magnetic charges and angular momentumcarried by the black hole. If the entropy function has a unique extremum thenthis extremum must be independent of the asymptotic values of the moduli scalarfields and the solution exhibits attractor behaviour. If the entropy functionhas flat directions then the near horizon background is not uniquely determinedby the extremization equations and could depend on the asymptotic data on themoduli fields, but the value of the entropy is still independent of thisasymptotic data. We illustrate these results in the context of two derivativetheories of gravity in several examples. These include Kerr black hole,Kerr-Newman black hole, black holes in Kaluza-Klein theory, and black holes intoroidally compactified heterotic string theory.

On chromatic number of colored mixed graphs

  An $(m,n)$-colored mixed graph $G$ is a graph with its arcs having one of the$m$ different colors and edges having one of the $n$ different colors. Ahomomorphism $f$ of an $(m,n)$-colored mixed graph $G$ to an $(m,n)$-coloredmixed graph $H$ is a vertex mapping such that if $uv$ is an arc (edge) of color$c$ in $G$, then $f(u)f(v)$ is an arc (edge) of color $c$ in $H$. The\textit{$(m,n)$-colored mixed chromatic number} $\chi_{(m,n)}(G)$ of an$(m,n)$-colored mixed graph $G$ is the order (number of vertices) of thesmallest homomorphic image of $G$. This notion was introduced byNe\v{s}et\v{r}il and Raspaud (2000, J. Combin. Theory, Ser. B 80, 147--155).They showed that $\chi_{(m,n)}(G) \leq k(2m+n)^{k-1}$ where $G$ is a$k$-acyclic colorable graph. We proved the tightness of this bound. We alsoshowed that the acyclic chromatic number of a graph is bounded by $k^2 + k^{2 +\lceil log_{(2m+n)} log_{(2m+n)} k \rceil}$ if its $(m,n)$-colored mixedchromatic number is at most $k$.  Furthermore, using probabilistic method, we showed that for graphs withmaximum degree $\Delta$ its $(m,n)$-colored mixed chromatic number is at most$2(\Delta-1)^{2m+n} (2m+n)^{\Delta-1}$. In particular, the last result directlyimproves the upper bound $2\Delta^2 2^{\Delta}$ of oriented chromatic number ofgraphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, obtained by Kostochka, Sopena and Zhu(1997, J. Graph Theory 24, 331--340) to $2(\Delta-1)^2 2^{\Delta -1}$. We alsoshow that there exists a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ and $(m,n)$-coloredmixed chromatic number at least $(2m+n)^{\Delta / 2}$.

On relative clique number of colored mixed graphs

  An $(m, n)$-colored mixed graph is a graph having arcs of $m$ differentcolors and edges of $n$ different colors. A graph homomorphism of an $(m,n$)-colored mixed graph $G$ to an $(m, n)$-colored mixed graph $H$ is a vertexmapping such that if $uv$ is an arc (edge) of color $c$ in $G$, then $f(u)f(v)$is also an arc (edge) of color $c$. The ($m, n)$-colored mixed chromatic numberof an $(m, n)$-colored mixed graph $G$, introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il andRaspaud [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 2000] is the order (number of vertices) ofthe smallest homomorphic image of $G$. Later Bensmail, Duffy and Sen [GraphsCombin. 2017] introduced another parameter related to the $(m, n)$-coloredmixed chromatic number, namely, the $(m, n)$-relative clique number as themaximum cardinality of a vertex subset which, pairwise, must have distinctimages with respect to any colored homomorphism.  In this article, we study the $(m, n$)-relative clique number for the familyof subcubic graphs, graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, planar graphs andtriangle-free planar graphs and provide new improved bounds in each of thecases. In particular, for subcubic graphs we provide exact value of theparameter.

Black Hole Microstates and Attractor Without Supersymmetry

  Due to the attractor mechanism, the entropy of an extremal black hole doesnot vary continuously as we vary the asymptotic values of various modulifields. Using this fact we argue that the entropy of an extremal black hole instring theory, calculated for a range of values of the asymptotic moduli forwhich the microscopic theory is strongly coupled, should match the statisticalentropy of the same system calculated for a range of values of the asymptoticmoduli for which the microscopic theory is weakly coupled. This argument doesnot rely on supersymmetry and applies equally well to nonsupersymmetricextremal black holes. We discuss several examples which support this argumentand also several caveats which could invalidate this argument.

Intermodal entanglement in Raman processes

  The operator solution of a completely quantum mechanical Hamiltonian of theRaman processes is used here to investigate the possibility of obtainingintermodal entanglement between different modes involved in the Raman processes(e.g. pump mode, Stokes mode, vibration (phonon) mode and anti-Stokes mode).Intermodal entanglement is reported between a) pump mode and anti-Stokes mode,b) pump mode and vibration (phonon) mode c) Stokes mode and vibration phononmode, d) Stokes mode and anti-stokes mode in the stimulated Raman processes forthe variation of the phase angle of complex eigenvalue $\alpha_{1}$ of pumpmode $a$. Some incidents of intermodal entanglement in the spontaneous and thepartially spontaneous Raman processes are also reported. Further it is shownthat the specific choice of coupling constants may produce genuine entanglementamong Stokes mode, anti-Stokes mode and vibration-phonon mode. It is also shownthat the two mode entanglement not identified by Duan's criterion may beidentified by Hillery-Zubairy criteria. It is further shown that intermodalentanglement, intermodal antibunching and intermodal squeezing are independentphenomena.

Nonclassicality in two-mode BEC

  An analytic operator solution of a generalized quantum mechanical Hamiltonianof two-mode Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) is obtained and the same is usedto investigate the nonclassical properties of the modes present in the system.Nonclassical characters are observed by means of single mode and intermodalsqueezing, single mode and intermodal sub-Poissonian boson statistics andintermodal entanglement. In addition to the traditionally studied lower ordernonclassical properties, signatures of higher order nonclassical characters oftwo-mode BEC systems are also obtained by investigating the possibility ofhigher order antibunching and higher order entanglement. The mutual relationamong the observed nonclassicalities and their evolution (variation) withrescaled time and the ratio of the single boson tunneling amplitude($\varepsilon$) and the coupling constant for the intra-modal interaction($\kappa$) are also reported.

Higher-order nonclassical properties of atom-molecule Bose-Einstein  Condensate

  The transient quantum statistical properties of the atoms and molecules in anatom-molecule BEC system are investigated by obtaining a third-orderperturbative solution of the Heisenberg's equations of motion corresponding tothe Hamiltonian of an atom-molecule BEC system where two atoms can collide toform a molecule. Time dependent quantities like two boson correlation,entanglement, squeezing, antibunching, etc., are computed and their propertiesare compared. It is established that atom-molecule BEC system is highlynonclassical as lower-order and higher-order squeezing and antibunching in pure(atomic and molecular) modes, squeezing and antibunching in compound mode andlower-order and higher-order entanglement in compound mode can be observed inthe atom-molecule BEC system. Exact numerical results are also reported andanalytic results obtained using the perturbative technique are shown tocoincide with the exact numerical results.

On a special class of boxicity 2 graphs

  We define and study a class of graphs, called 2-stab interval graphs (2SIG),with boxicity 2 which properly contains the class of interval graphs. A 2SIG isan axes-parallel rectangle intersection graph where the rectangles have unitheight (that is, length of the side parallel to $Y$-axis) and intersects eitherof the two fixed lines, parallel to the $X$-axis, distance $1+\epsilon$ ($0 <\epsilon < 1$) apart. Intuitively, 2SIG is a graph obtained by putting someedges between two interval graphs in a particular rule. It turns out that forthese kind of graphs, the chromatic number of any of its induced subgraphs isbounded by twice of its (induced subgraph) clique number. This shows that thegraph, even though not perfect, is not very far from it. Then we prove similarresults for some subclasses of 2SIG and provide efficient algorithm for findingtheir clique number. We provide a matrix characterization for a subclass of2SIG graph.

A Strongly Coupled Anisotropic Fluid From Dilaton Driven Holography

  We consider a system consisting of $5$ dimensional gravity with a negativecosmological constant coupled to a massless scalar, the dilaton. We construct ablack brane solution which arises when the dilaton satisfies linearly varyingboundary conditions in the asymptotically $AdS_5$ region. The geometry of thisblack brane breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translationalinvariance and corresponds to an anisotropic phase of the system. Close toextremality, where the anisotropy is big compared to the temperature, somecomponents of the viscosity tensor become parametrically small compared to theentropy density. We study the quasi normal modes in considerable detail andfind no instability close to extremality. We also obtain the equations forfluid mechanics for an anisotropic driven system in general, working upto firstorder in the derivative expansion for the stress tensor, and identifyadditional transport coefficients which appear in the constitutive relation.For the fluid of interest we find that the parametrically small viscosity canresult in a very small force of friction, when the fluid is enclosed betweenappropriately oriented parallel plates moving with a relative velocity.

Hierarchical Heuristic Learning towards Effcient Norm Emergence

  Social norms serve as an important mechanism to regulate the behaviors ofagents and to facilitate coordination among them in multiagent systems. Oneimportant research question is how a norm can rapidly emerge through repeatedlocal interaction within an agent society under different environments whentheir coordination space becomes large. To address this problem, we propose aHierarchically Heuristic Learning Strategy (HHLS) under the hierarchical sociallearning framework, in which subordinate agents report their information totheir supervisors, while supervisors can generate instructions (rules andsuggestions) based on the information collected from their subordinates.Subordinate agents heuristically update their strategies based on both theirown experience and the instructions from their supervisors. Extensiveexperiment evaluations show that HHLS can support the emergence of desirablesocial norms more efficiently and is applicable in a much wider range ofmultiagent interaction scenarios compared with previous work. We alsoinvestigate the effectiveness of HHLS by separating out the differentcomponents of the HHLS and evaluating the relative importance of thosecomponents. The influence of key related factors (e.g., hierarchical factors,non-hierarchical factors, fixed-strategy agents) are investigated as well.
