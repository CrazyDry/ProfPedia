Boltzmann Machine Learning with the Latent Maximum Entropy Principle

  We present a new statistical learning paradigm for Boltzmann machines based
on a new inference principle we have proposed: the latent maximum entropy
principle (LME). LME is different both from Jaynes maximum entropy principle
and from standard maximum likelihood estimation.We demonstrate the LME
principle BY deriving new algorithms for Boltzmann machine parameter
estimation, and show how robust and fast new variant of the EM algorithm can be
developed.Our experiments show that estimation based on LME generally yields
better results than maximum likelihood estimation, particularly when inferring
hidden units from small amounts of data.


Slim Embedding Layers for Recurrent Neural Language Models

  Recurrent neural language models are the state-of-the-art models for language
modeling. When the vocabulary size is large, the space taken to store the model
parameters becomes the bottleneck for the use of recurrent neural language
models. In this paper, we introduce a simple space compression method that
randomly shares the structured parameters at both the input and output
embedding layers of the recurrent neural language models to significantly
reduce the size of model parameters, but still compactly represent the original
input and output embedding layers. The method is easy to implement and tune.
Experiments on several data sets show that the new method can get similar
perplexity and BLEU score results while only using a very tiny fraction of
parameters.
