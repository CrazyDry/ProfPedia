Surface Normals in the Wild

  We study the problem of single-image depth estimation for images in the wild.We collect human annotated surface normals and use them to train a neuralnetwork that directly predicts pixel-wise depth. We propose two novel lossfunctions for training with surface normal annotations. Experiments on NYUDepth and our own dataset demonstrate that our approach can significantlyimprove the quality of depth estimation in the wild.

Constructing $2m$-variable Boolean functions with optimal algebraic  immunity based on polar decomposition of $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}^*$

  Constructing $2m$-variable Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunitybased on decomposition of additive group of the finite field$\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$ seems to be a promising approach since Tu and Deng'swork. In this paper, we consider the same problem in a new way. Based on polardecomposition of the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$, we proposea new construction of Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity. By aslight modification of it, we obtain a class of balanced Boolean functionsachieving optimal algebraic immunity, which also have optimal algebraic degreeand high nonlinearity. Computer investigations imply that this class offunctions also behave well against fast algebraic attacks.

Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation

  This work introduces a novel convolutional network architecture for the taskof human pose estimation. Features are processed across all scales andconsolidated to best capture the various spatial relationships associated withthe body. We show how repeated bottom-up, top-down processing used inconjunction with intermediate supervision is critical to improving theperformance of the network. We refer to the architecture as a "stackedhourglass" network based on the successive steps of pooling and upsampling thatare done to produce a final set of predictions. State-of-the-art results areachieved on the FLIC and MPII benchmarks outcompeting all recent methods.

Single-Image Depth Perception in the Wild

  This paper studies single-image depth perception in the wild, i.e.,recovering depth from a single image taken in unconstrained settings. Weintroduce a new dataset "Depth in the Wild" consisting of images in the wildannotated with relative depth between pairs of random points. We also propose anew algorithm that learns to estimate metric depth using annotations ofrelative depth. Compared to the state of the art, our algorithm is simpler andperforms better. Experiments show that our algorithm, combined with existingRGB-D data and our new relative depth annotations, significantly improvessingle-image depth perception in the wild.

Premise Selection for Theorem Proving by Deep Graph Embedding

  We propose a deep learning-based approach to the problem of premiseselection: selecting mathematical statements relevant for proving a givenconjecture. We represent a higher-order logic formula as a graph that isinvariant to variable renaming but still fully preserves syntactic and semanticinformation. We then embed the graph into a vector via a novel embedding methodthat preserves the information of edge ordering. Our approach achievesstate-of-the-art results on the HolStep dataset, improving the classificationaccuracy from 83% to 90.3%.

Shape from Shading through Shape Evolution

  In this paper, we address the shape-from-shading problem by training deepnetworks with synthetic images. Unlike conventional approaches that combinedeep learning and synthetic imagery, we propose an approach that does not needany external shape dataset to render synthetic images. Our approach consists oftwo synergistic processes: the evolution of complex shapes from simpleprimitives, and the training of a deep network for shape-from-shading. Theevolution generates better shapes guided by the network training, while thetraining improves by using the evolved shapes. We show that our approachachieves state-of-the-art performance on a shape-from-shading benchmark.

Think Visually: Question Answering through Virtual Imagery

  In this paper, we study the problem of geometric reasoning in the context ofquestion-answering. We introduce Dynamic Spatial Memory Network (DSMN), a newdeep network architecture designed for answering questions that admit latentvisual representations. DSMN learns to generate and reason over suchrepresentations. Further, we propose two synthetic benchmarks, FloorPlanQA andShapeIntersection, to evaluate the geometric reasoning capability of QAsystems. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed DSMNfor visual thinking tasks.

CornerNet: Detecting Objects as Paired Keypoints

  We propose CornerNet, a new approach to object detection where we detect anobject bounding box as a pair of keypoints, the top-left corner and thebottom-right corner, using a single convolution neural network. By detectingobjects as paired keypoints, we eliminate the need for designing a set ofanchor boxes commonly used in prior single-stage detectors. In addition to ournovel formulation, we introduce corner pooling, a new type of pooling layerthat helps the network better localize corners. Experiments show that CornerNetachieves a 42.2% AP on MS COCO, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors.

Speaker Naming in Movies

  We propose a new model for speaker naming in movies that leverages visual,textual, and acoustic modalities in an unified optimization framework. Toevaluate the performance of our model, we introduce a new dataset consisting ofsix episodes of the Big Bang Theory TV show and eighteen full movies coveringdifferent genres. Our experiments show that our multimodal model significantlyoutperforms several competitive baselines on the average weighted F-scoremetric. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we design anend-to-end memory network model that leverages our speaker naming model andachieves state-of-the-art results on the subtitles task of the MovieQA 2017Challenge.

DeepV2D: Video to Depth with Differentiable Structure from Motion

  We propose DeepV2D, an end-to-end differentiable deep learning architecturefor predicting depth from a video sequence. We incorporate elements ofclassical Structure from Motion into an end-to-end trainable pipeline bydesigning a set of differentiable geometric modules. Our full system alternatesbetween predicting depth and refining camera pose. We estimate depth bybuilding a cost volume over learned features and apply a multi-scale 3Dconvolutional network for stereo matching. The predicted depth is then sent tothe motion module which performs iterative pose updates by mapping optical flowto a camera motion update. We evaluate our proposed system on NYU, KITTI, andSUN3D datasets and show improved results over monocular baselines and deep andclassical stereo reconstruction.

Experimental generation of tripartite polarization entangled states of  bright optical beams

  The multipartite polarization entangled states of bright optical beamsdirectly associating with the spin states of atomic ensembles are one of theessential resources in the future quantum information networks, which can beconveniently utilized to transfer and convert quantum states across a networkcomposed of many atomic nodes. In this letter, we present the experimentaldemonstration of tripartite polarization entanglement described by Stokesoperators of optical field. The tripartite entangled states of light at thefrequency resonant with D1 line of Rubidium atoms are transformed into thecontinuous variable polarization entanglement among three bright optical beamsvia an optical beam splitter network. The obtained entanglement is confirmed bythe extended criterion for polarization entanglement of multipartite quantizedoptical modes.

Establishing and storing of deterministic quantum entanglement among  three distant atomic ensembles

  It is crucial for physical realization of quantum information networks tofirst establish entanglement among multiple space-separated quantum memoriesand then at a user-controlled moment to transfer the stored entanglement toquantum channels for distribution and conveyance of information. Here wepresent an experimental demonstration on generation, storage and transfer ofdeterministic quantum entanglement among three spatially separated atomicensembles. The off-line prepared multipartite entanglement of optical modes ismapped into three distant atomic ensembles to establish entanglement of atomicspin waves via electromagnetically-induced-transparency light-matterinteraction. Then the stored atomic entanglement is transferred into atripartite quadrature entangled state of light, which is space-separated andcan be dynamically allocated to three quantum channels for conveying quantuminformation. The existence of entanglement among released three optical modesverifies that the system has capacity of preserving multipartite entanglement.The presented protocol can be directly extended to larger quantum networks withmore nodes.

Deep Learning Inference in Facebook Data Centers: Characterization,  Performance Optimizations and Hardware Implications

  The application of deep learning techniques resulted in remarkableimprovement of machine learning models. In this paper provides detailedcharacterizations of deep learning models used in many Facebook social networkservices. We present computational characteristics of our models, describe highperformance optimizations targeting existing systems, point out theirlimitations and make suggestions for the future general-purpose/acceleratedinference hardware. Also, we highlight the need for better co-design ofalgorithms, numerics and computing platforms to address the challenges ofworkloads often run in data centers.

Wavelet filters and infinite-dimensional unitary groups

  In this paper, we study wavelet filters and their dependence on two numbers,the scale N and the genus g. We show that the wavelet filters, in thequadrature mirror case, have a harmonic analysis which is based onrepresentations of the C^*-algebra O_N. A main tool in our analysis is theinfinite-dimensional group of all maps T -> U(N) (where U(N) is the group ofall unitary N-by-N matrices), and we study the extension problem from low-passfilter to multiresolution filter using this group.

Titanium dioxide hole-blocking layer in ultra-thin-film crystalline  silicon solar cells

  One of the remaining obstacles to approaching the theoretical efficiencylimit of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells is the exceedingly highinterface recombination loss for minority carriers at the Ohmic contacts. Inultra-thin-film c-Si solar cells, this contact recombination loss is far moresevere than for traditional thick cells due to the smaller volume and higherminority carrier concentration of the former. This paper presents a noveldesign of an electron passing (Ohmic) contact to n-type Si that ishole-blocking with significantly reduced hole recombination. This contact isformed by depositing a thin titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer to form a siliconmetal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) contact. A 2 {\mu}m thick Si cell with thisTiO2 MIS contact achieved an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 645 mV, which is 10mV higher than that of an ultra-thin cell with a metal contact. This MIScontact demonstrates a new path for ultra-thin-film c-Si solar cells to achievehigh efficiencies as high as traditional thick cells, and enables thefabrication of high-efficiency c-Si solar cells at a lower cost.

Stacked Dense U-Nets with Dual Transformers for Robust Face Alignment

  Facial landmark localisation in images captured in-the-wild is an importantand challenging problem. The current state-of-the-art revolves around certainkinds of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) such as stacked U-Nets andHourglass networks. In this work, we innovatively propose stacked dense U-Netsfor this task. We design a novel scale aggregation network topology structureand a channel aggregation building block to improve the model's capacitywithout sacrificing the computational complexity and model size. With theassistance of deformable convolutions inside the stacked dense U-Nets andcoherent loss for outside data transformation, our model obtains the ability tobe spatially invariant to arbitrary input face images. Extensive experiments onmany in-the-wild datasets, validate the robustness of the proposed method underextreme poses, exaggerated expressions and heavy occlusions. Finally, we showthat accurate 3D face alignment can assist pose-invariant face recognitionwhere we achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy on CFP-FP.

Accurate 3D Face Reconstruction with Weakly-Supervised Learning: From  Single Image to Image Set

  Recently, deep learning based 3D face reconstruction methods have shownpromising results in both quality and efficiency.However, training deep neuralnetworks typically requires a large volume of data, whereas face images withground-truth 3D face shapes are scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel deep3D face reconstruction approach that 1) leverages a robust, hybrid lossfunction for weakly-supervised learning which takes into account both low-leveland perception-level information for supervision, and 2) performs multi-imageface reconstruction by exploiting complementary information from differentimages for shape aggregation. Our method is fast, accurate, and robust toocclusion and large pose. We provide comprehensive experiments on threedatasets, systematically comparing our method with fifteen recent methods anddemonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.

Could the 21-cm absorption be explained by the dark matter suggested by  $^8$Be transitions?

  The stronger than expected 21-cm absorption was observed by EDGES recently,and another anomaly of $^8$Be transitions would be signatures of newinteractions. These two issues may be related to each other, e.g., pseudoscalar$A$ mediated fermionic millicharged dark matter (DM), and the 21-cm absorptioncould be induced by photon mediated scattering between MeV millicharged DM andhydrogen. This will be explored in this paper. For fermionic millicharged DM$\bar{\chi} \chi$ with masses in a range of $2 m_A < 2 m_{\chi} < 3 m_A$, thep-wave annihilation $\bar{\chi} \chi \to A A$ would be dominant during DMfreeze-out. The s-wave annihilation $\bar{\chi} \chi$ $\to A, \gamma $ $\to e^+e^-$ is tolerant by constraints from CMB and the 21-cm absorption. Themillicharged DM can evade constraints from direct detection experiments. Theprocess of $K^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^0$ with the invisible decay $\pi^0 \to \bar{\chi}\chi$ could be employed to search for the millicharged DM, and future highintensity $K^+$ sources, such as NA62, will do the job.

ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition

  One of the main challenges in feature learning using Deep ConvolutionalNeural Networks (DCNNs) for large-scale face recognition is the design ofappropriate loss functions that enhance discriminative power. Centre losspenalises the distance between the deep features and their corresponding classcentres in the Euclidean space to achieve intra-class compactness. SphereFaceassumes that the linear transformation matrix in the last fully connected layercan be used as a representation of the class centres in an angular space andpenalises the angles between the deep features and their corresponding weightsin a multiplicative way. Recently, a popular line of research is to incorporatemargins in well-established loss functions in order to maximise face classseparability. In this paper, we propose an Additive Angular Margin Loss(ArcFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. Theproposed ArcFace has a clear geometric interpretation due to the exactcorrespondence to the geodesic distance on the hypersphere. We present arguablythe most extensive experimental evaluation of all the recent state-of-the-artface recognition methods on over 10 face recognition benchmarks including a newlarge-scale image database with trillion level of pairs and a large-scale videodataset. We show that ArcFace consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art andcan be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead. We releaseall refined training data, training codes, pre-trained models and traininglogs, which will help reproduce the results in this paper.

Acoustic transmission enhancement through a periodically-structured  stiff plate without any opening

  We report both experimentally and theoretically that the enhanced acoustictransmission can occur in the subwavelength region through a thin but stiffstructured-plate without any opening. This exotic acoustic phenomenon isessentially distinct from the previous related studies originated from, eithercollectively or individually, the interaction of the incident wave withopenings in previous structures. It is attributed to the structure-inducedresonant excitation of the non-leaky Lamb modes that exist intrinsically in theuniform elastic plate. Our finding should have impact on ultrasonicapplications.

Gate sequence for continuous variable one-way quantum computation

  Measurement-based one-way quantum computation (QC) using cluster states asresources provides an efficient model to perform computation and informationprocessing of quantum codes. Arbitrary Gaussian QC can be implemented bysufficiently long single-mode and two-mode gate sequences. However, continuousvariable (CV) gate sequences have not been realized so far due to an absence ofcluster states larger than four submodes. Here we present the first CV gatesequence consisting of a single-mode squeezing gate and a two-modecontrolled-phase gate based on a six-mode cluster state. The quantum propertyof this gate sequence is confirmed by the fidelities and the quantumentanglement of two output modes, which depend on both the squeezing andcontrolled-phase gates. The experiment demonstrates the feasibility ofimplementing Gaussian QC by means of accessible gate sequences.

Losses-based test of wave-particle duality with Mach-Zehnder  interferometers

  Wave-particle duality of photons with losses in the Mach-Zehnderinterferometer (MZI) is investigated experimentally and theoretically. Theexperiment is done with the standard MZI with the beam splitter or the beammerger being continuously varied. The losses are deliberately introduced eitherinside the MZI (the two arms between the beam splitter and beam mergers) oroutside the MZI (after the beam merger). It is proved that the unbalancedlosses have great influence on the predictability $P$ (particle nature) andvisibility $V$ (wave nature). For the former case the duality inequality holdswhile for the later the duality inequality is ``violated''. We get $P^2+V^2>1$.This ``violation'' could be eliminated in principle by switching the two pathsand detectors and then averaging the results. The observed results can beexactly explained theoretically. The experiment is done with coherent beam,instead of single photons, and we have proved that they are exactly equivalentin duality experiment with MZI.

Gates for one-way quantum computation based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen  entanglement

  Single-mode squeezing and Fourier transformation operations are two essentiallogical gates in continuous-variable quantum computation, which have beenexperimentally implemented by means of an optical four-mode cluster state. Inthis paper, we present a simpler and more efficient protocol based on the useof Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen two-mode entangled states to realize the sameoperations. The theoretical calculations and the experimental resultsdemonstrate that the presented scheme not only decreases the requirement to theresource quantum states at the largest extent but also enhances significantlythe squeezing degree and the fidelity of the resultant modes under an identicalresource condition. That is because in our system the influence of the excessnoises deriving from the imperfect squeezing of the resource states isdegraded. The gate operations applying two-mode entanglement can be utilized asa basic element in a future quantum computer involving a large-scale clusterstate.

Associative Embedding: End-to-End Learning for Joint Detection and  Grouping

  We introduce associative embedding, a novel method for supervisingconvolutional neural networks for the task of detection and grouping. A numberof computer vision problems can be framed in this manner including multi-personpose estimation, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. Usually thegrouping of detections is achieved with multi-stage pipelines, instead wepropose an approach that teaches a network to simultaneously output detectionsand group assignments. This technique can be easily integrated into anystate-of-the-art network architecture that produces pixel-wise predictions. Weshow how to apply this method to both multi-person pose estimation and instancesegmentation and report state-of-the-art performance for multi-person pose onthe MPII and MS-COCO datasets.

Dynamic Deep Neural Networks: Optimizing Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-offs  by Selective Execution

  We introduce Dynamic Deep Neural Networks (D2NN), a new type of feed-forwarddeep neural network that allows selective execution. Given an input, only asubset of D2NN neurons are executed, and the particular subset is determined bythe D2NN itself. By pruning unnecessary computation depending on input, D2NNsprovide a way to improve computational efficiency. To achieve dynamic selectiveexecution, a D2NN augments a feed-forward deep neural network (directed acyclicgraph of differentiable modules) with controller modules. Each controllermodule is a sub-network whose output is a decision that controls whether othermodules can execute. A D2NN is trained end to end. Both regular and controllermodules in a D2NN are learnable and are jointly trained to optimize bothaccuracy and efficiency. Such training is achieved by integratingbackpropagation with reinforcement learning. With extensive experiments ofvarious D2NN architectures on image classification tasks, we demonstrate thatD2NNs are general and flexible, and can effectively optimizeaccuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Learning to Detect Human-Object Interactions

  We study the problem of detecting human-object interactions (HOI) in staticimages, defined as predicting a human and an object bounding box with aninteraction class label that connects them. HOI detection is a fundamentalproblem in computer vision as it provides semantic information about theinteractions among the detected objects. We introduce HICO-DET, a new largebenchmark for HOI detection, by augmenting the current HICO classificationbenchmark with instance annotations. To solve the task, we propose Human-ObjectRegion-based Convolutional Neural Networks (HO-RCNN). At the core of ourHO-RCNN is the Interaction Pattern, a novel DNN input that characterizes thespatial relations between two bounding boxes. Experiments on HICO-DETdemonstrate that our HO-RCNN, by exploiting human-object spatial relationsthrough Interaction Patterns, significantly improves the performance of HOIdetection over baseline approaches.

Out-of-plane easy-axis in thin films of diluted magnetic semiconductor  Ba1-xKx(Zn1-yMny)2As2

  Single-phased, single-oriented thin films of Mn-doped ZnAs-based dilutedmagnetic semiconductor (DMS) Ba1-xKx(Zn1-yMny)2As2 (x = 0.03, 0.08; y = 0.15)have been deposited on Si, SrTiO3, LaAlO3, (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3, and MgAl2O4substrates, respectively. Utilizing a combined synthesis and characterizationsystem excluding the air and further optimizing the deposition parameters,high-quality thin films could be obtained and be measured showing that they cankeep inactive-in-air up to more than 90 hours characterized by electricaltransport measurements. In comparison with films of x = 0.03 which possessrelatively higher resistivity, weaker magnetic performances, and larger energygap, thin films of x = 0.08 show better electrical and magnetic performances.Strong magnetic anisotropy was found in films of x = 0.08 grown on(La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 substrate with their magnetic polarization aligned almostsolely on the film growth direction.

Forecasting Human Dynamics from Static Images

  This paper presents the first study on forecasting human dynamics from staticimages. The problem is to input a single RGB image and generate a sequence ofupcoming human body poses in 3D. To address the problem, we propose the 3D PoseForecasting Network (3D-PFNet). Our 3D-PFNet integrates recent advances onsingle-image human pose estimation and sequence prediction, and converts the 2Dpredictions into 3D space. We train our 3D-PFNet using a three-step trainingstrategy to leverage a diverse source of training data, including image andvideo based human pose datasets and 3D motion capture (MoCap) data. Wedemonstrate competitive performance of our 3D-PFNet on 2D pose forecasting and3D pose recovery through quantitative and qualitative results.

Temporal Action Localization by Structured Maximal Sums

  We address the problem of temporal action localization in videos. We poseaction localization as a structured prediction over arbitrary-length temporalwindows, where each window is scored as the sum of frame-wise classificationscores. Additionally, our model classifies the start, middle, and end of eachaction as separate components, allowing our system to explicitly model eachaction's temporal evolution and take advantage of informative temporaldependencies present in this structure. In this framework, we localize actionsby searching for the structured maximal sum, a problem for which we develop anovel, provably-efficient algorithmic solution. The frame-wise classificationscores are computed using features from a deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), which are trained end-to-end to directly optimize for a novel structuredobjective. We evaluate our system on the THUMOS 14 action detection benchmarkand achieve competitive performance.

Pixels to Graphs by Associative Embedding

  Graphs are a useful abstraction of image content. Not only can graphsrepresent details about individual objects in a scene but they can capture theinteractions between pairs of objects. We present a method for training aconvolutional neural network such that it takes in an input image and producesa full graph definition. This is done end-to-end in a single stage with the useof associative embeddings. The network learns to simultaneously identify all ofthe elements that make up a graph and piece them together. We benchmark on theVisual Genome dataset, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on thechallenging task of scene graph generation.

Scalable Annotation of Fine-Grained Categories Without Experts

  We present a crowdsourcing workflow to collect image annotations for visuallysimilar synthetic categories without requiring experts. In animals, there is adirect link between taxonomy and visual similarity: e.g. a collie (type of dog)looks more similar to other collies (e.g. smooth collie) than a greyhound(another type of dog). However, in synthetic categories such as cars, objectswith similar taxonomy can have very different appearance: e.g. a 2011 FordF-150 Supercrew-HD looks the same as a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-LL but verydifferent from a 2011 Ford F-150 Supercrew-SVT. We introduce a graph basedcrowdsourcing algorithm to automatically group visually indistinguishableobjects together. Using our workflow, we label 712,430 images by ~1,000 AmazonMechanical Turk workers; resulting in the largest fine-grained visual datasetreported to date with 2,657 categories of cars annotated at 1/20th the cost ofhiring experts.

Rethinking the Faster R-CNN Architecture for Temporal Action  Localization

  We propose TAL-Net, an improved approach to temporal action localization invideo that is inspired by the Faster R-CNN object detection framework. TAL-Netaddresses three key shortcomings of existing approaches: (1) we improvereceptive field alignment using a multi-scale architecture that can accommodateextreme variation in action durations; (2) we better exploit the temporalcontext of actions for both proposal generation and action classification byappropriately extending receptive fields; and (3) we explicitly considermulti-stream feature fusion and demonstrate that fusing motion late isimportant. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for both action proposal andlocalization on THUMOS'14 detection benchmark and competitive performance onActivityNet challenge.

Decorrelated Batch Normalization

  Batch Normalization (BN) is capable of accelerating the training of deepmodels by centering and scaling activations within mini-batches. In this work,we propose Decorrelated Batch Normalization (DBN), which not just centers andscales activations but whitens them. We explore multiple whitening techniques,and find that PCA whitening causes a problem we call stochastic axis swapping,which is detrimental to learning. We show that ZCA whitening does not sufferfrom this problem, permitting successful learning. DBN retains the desirablequalities of BN and further improves BN's optimization efficiency andgeneralization ability. We design comprehensive experiments to show that DBNcan improve the performance of BN on multilayer perceptrons and convolutionalneural networks. Furthermore, we consistently improve the accuracy of residualnetworks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

Learning Single-Image Depth from Videos using Quality Assessment  Networks

  Depth estimation from a single image in the wild remains a challengingproblem. One main obstacle is the lack of high-quality training data for imagesin the wild. In this paper we propose a method to automatically generate suchdata through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) on Internet videos. The core of thismethod is a Quality Assessment Network that identifies high-qualityreconstructions obtained from SfM. Using this method, we collect single-viewdepth training data from a large number of YouTube videos and construct a newdataset called YouTube3D. Experiments show that YouTube3D is useful in trainingdepth estimation networks and advances the state of the art of single-viewdepth estimation in the wild.

SegStereo: Exploiting Semantic Information for Disparity Estimation

  Disparity estimation for binocular stereo images finds a wide range ofapplications. Traditional algorithms may fail on featureless regions, whichcould be handled by high-level clues such as semantic segments. In this paper,we suggest that appropriate incorporation of semantic cues can greatly rectifyprediction in commonly-used disparity estimation frameworks. Our methodconducts semantic feature embedding and regularizes semantic cues as the lossterm to improve learning disparity. Our unified model SegStereo employssemantic features from segmentation and introduces semantic softmax loss, whichhelps improve the prediction accuracy of disparity maps. The semantic cues workwell in both unsupervised and supervised manners. SegStereo achievesstate-of-the-art results on KITTI Stereo benchmark and produces decentprediction on both CityScapes and FlyingThings3D datasets.

Rethinking Numerical Representations for Deep Neural Networks

  With ever-increasing computational demand for deep learning, it is criticalto investigate the implications of the numeric representation and precision ofDNN model weights and activations on computational efficiency. In this work, weexplore unconventional narrow-precision floating-point representations as itrelates to inference accuracy and efficiency to steer the improved design offuture DNN platforms. We show that inference using these custom numericrepresentations on production-grade DNNs, including GoogLeNet and VGG, achievesan average speedup of 7.6x with less than 1% degradation in inference accuracyrelative to a state-of-the-art baseline platform representing the mostsophisticated hardware using single-precision floating point. To facilitate theuse of such customized precision, we also present a novel technique thatdrastically reduces the time required to derive the optimal precisionconfiguration.

You Only Look & Listen Once: Towards Fast and Accurate Visual Grounding

  Visual Grounding (VG) aims to locate the most relevant region in an image,based on a flexible natural language query but not a pre-defined label, thus itcan be a more useful technique than object detection in practice. Moststate-of-the-art methods in VG operate in a two-stage manner, wherein the firststage an object detector is adopted to generate a set of object proposals fromthe input image and the second stage is simply formulated as a cross-modalmatching problem that finds the best match between the language query and allregion proposals. This is rather inefficient because there might be hundreds ofproposals produced in the first stage that need to be compared in the secondstage, not to mention this strategy performs inaccurately. In this paper, wepropose an simple, intuitive and much more elegant one-stage detection basedmethod that joints the region proposal and matching stage as a single detectionnetwork. The detection is conditioned on the input query with a stack of novelRelation-to-Attention modules that transform the image-to-query relationship toan relation map, which is used to predict the bounding box directly withoutproposing large numbers of useless region proposals. During the inference, ourapproach is about 20x ~ 30x faster than previous methods and, remarkably, itachieves 18% ~ 41% absolute performance improvement on top of thestate-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. We release our code andall the pre-trained models at https://github.com/openblack/rvg.

Power-Law Decay of Standing Waves on the Surface of Topological  Insulators

  We propose a general theory on the standing waves (quasiparticle interferencepattern) caused by the scattering of surface states off step edges intopological insulators, in which the extremal points on the constant energycontour of surface band play the dominant role. Experimentally we image theinterference patterns on both Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films by measuringthe local density of states using a scanning tunneling microscope. The observeddecay indices of the standing waves agree excellently with the theoreticalprediction: In Bi$_2$Se$_3$, only a single decay index of -3/2 exists; while inBi$_2$Te$_3$ with strongly warped surface band, it varies from -3/2 to -1/2 andfinally to -1 as the energy increases. The -1/2 decay indicates that thesuppression of backscattering due to time-reversal symmetry does notnecessarily lead to a spatial decay rate faster than that in the conventionaltwo-dimensional electron system. Our formalism can also explain thecharacteristic scattering wave vectors of the standing wave caused bynon-magnetic impurities on Bi$_2$Te$_3$.

Interface induced high temperature superconductivity in single unit-cell  FeSe films on SrTiO3

  Searching for superconducting materials with high transition temperature (TC)is one of the most exciting and challenging fields in physics and materialsscience. Although superconductivity has been discovered for more than 100years, the copper oxides are so far the only materials with TC above 77 K, theliquid nitrogen boiling point. Here we report an interface engineering methodfor dramatically raising the TC of superconducting films. We find that oneunit-cell (UC) thick films of FeSe grown on SrTiO3 (STO) substrates bymolecular beam epitaxy (MBE) show signatures of superconducting transitionabove 50 K by transport measurement. A superconducting gap as large as 20 meVof the 1 UC films observed by scanning tunneling microcopy (STM) suggests thatthe superconductivity could occur above 77 K. The occurrence ofsuperconductivity is further supported by the presence of superconductingvortices under magnetic field. Our work not only demonstrates a powerful wayfor finding new superconductors and for raising TC, but also provides awell-defined platform for systematic study of the mechanism of unconventionalsuperconductivity by using different superconducting materials and substrates.

ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge

  The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark inobject category classification and detection on hundreds of object categoriesand millions of images. The challenge has been run annually from 2010 topresent, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions.  This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advancesin object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss thechallenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight keybreakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis ofthe current state of the field of large-scale image classification and objectdetection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with humanaccuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the five years of the challenge,and propose future directions and improvements.

Site-wise manipulations and Mott insulator-superfluid transition of  interacting photons using superconducting circuit simulators

  The Bose Hubbard model (BHM) of interacting bosons in a lattice has been aparadigm in many-body physics, and it exhibits a Mott insulator (MI)-superfluid(SF) transition at integer filling. Here a quantum simulator of the BHM using asuperconducting circuit is proposed. Specifically, a superconductingtransmission line resonator supporting microwave photons is coupled to a chargequbit to form one site of the BHM, and adjacent sites are connected by atunable coupler. To obtain a mapping from the superconducting circuit to theBHM, we focus on the dispersive regime where the excitations remainphoton-like. Standard perturbation theory is implemented to locate theparameter range where the MI-SF transition may be simulated. This simulatorallows single-site manipulations and we illustrate this feature by consideringtwo scenarios where a single-site manipulation can drive a MI-SF transition.The transition can be analyzed by mean-field analyses, and the exactdiagonalization was implemented to provide accurate results. The variance ofthe photon density and the fidelity metric clearly show signatures of thetransition. Experimental realizations and other possible applications of thissimulator are also discussed.

Probabilistic Label Relation Graphs with Ising Models

  We consider classification problems in which the label space has structure. Acommon example is hierarchical label spaces, corresponding to the case whereone label subsumes another (e.g., animal subsumes dog). But labels can also bemutually exclusive (e.g., dog vs cat) or unrelated (e.g., furry, carnivore). Tojointly model hierarchy and exclusion relations, the notion of a HEX (hierarchyand exclusion) graph was introduced in [7]. This combined a conditional randomfield (CRF) with a deep neural network (DNN), resulting in state of the artresults when applied to visual object classification problems where thetraining labels were drawn from different levels of the ImageNet hierarchy(e.g., an image might be labeled with the basic level category "dog", ratherthan the more specific label "husky"). In this paper, we extend the HEX modelto allow for soft or probabilistic relations between labels, which is usefulwhen there is uncertainty about the relationship between two labels (e.g., anantelope is "sort of" furry, but not to the same degree as a grizzly bear). Wecall our new model pHEX, for probabilistic HEX. We show that the pHEX graph canbe converted to an Ising model, which allows us to use existing off-the-shelfinference methods (in contrast to the HEX method, which needed specializedinference algorithms). Experimental results show significant improvements in anumber of large-scale visual object classification tasks, outperforming theprevious HEX model.

Direct evidences for inner-shell electron-excitation by laser induced  electron recollision

  Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulses, generated by a process known aslaser-induced electron recollision, are a key ingredient for attosecondmetrology, providing a tool to precisely initiate and probe sub-femtoseconddynamics in the microcosms of atoms, molecules and solids[1]. However, with thecurrent technology, extending attosecond metrology to scrutinize the dynamicsof the inner-shell electrons is a challenge, that is because of the lowerefficiency in generating the required soft x-ray \hbar\omega>300 eV attosecondbursts and the lower absorption cross-sections in this spectral range. A wayaround this problem is to use the recolliding electron to directly initiate thedesired inner-shell process, instead of using the currently low flux x-rayattosecond sources.Such an excitation process occurs in a sub-femtosecondtimescale, and may provide the necessary "pump" step in a pump-probeexperiment[2]. Here we used a few cycle infrared \lambda_{0}~1800nm source[3]and observed direct evidences for inner-shell excitations through thelaser-induced electron recollision process. It is the first step towardtime-resolved core-hole studies in the keV energy range with sub-femtosecondtime resolution.

Monolayer charge-neutral graphene on platinum with extremely weak  electron-phonon coupling

  Epitaxial growth of graphene on transition metal substrates is an importantroute for obtaining large scale graphene. However, the interaction betweengraphene and the substrate often leads to multiple orientations, distortedgraphene band structure, large doping and strong electron-phonon coupling. Herewe report the growth of monolayer graphene with high crystalline quality onPt(111) substrate by using a very low concentration of an internal carbonsource with high annealing temperature. The controlled growth leads toelectronically decoupled graphene: it is nearly charge neutral and hasextremely weak electron-phonon coupling (coupling strength $\lambda$ $\approx$0.056) as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic measurements.The thermodynamics and kinetics of the carbon diffusion process is investigatedby DFT calculation. Such graphene with negligible graphene-substrateinteraction provides an important platform for fundamental research as well asdevice applications when combined with a nondestructive sample transfertechnique.

Chromatic Effect for THz Generation in a Novel Wave-front Tilt Scheme

  Deriving single or few cycle terahertz pulse (THz) by intense femtosecondlaser through cascaded optical rectification in electro-optic crystals is acrucial technique in cutting-edge time-resolved spectroscopy to characterizemicro-scale structures and ultrafast dynamics. In the past decade, lithiumniobate (LN) crystal implementation of wave-front tilt scheme has beenprevalently used, while painstaking efforts have been invested in order toachieve higher THz conversion efficiency. In this research we developed a brandnew type of LN crystal possessing dual-face-cut and Brewster coupling, andconducted experimental and simulative investigation systematically to optimizethe multi-dimensionally entangled parameters in THz generation, predicting theextreme conversion efficiency of 10% is potentially promising at the THzabsorption coefficient of 0.5cm-1. More remarkably, we first discovered thatthe chirp of the driving laser pulse plays a decisive role in the wave-fronttilt scheme, and the THz generation efficiency could be enhanced tremendouslyby applying an appropriate chirp.

Highly responsive ground state of PbTaSe$_2$: structural phase  transition and evolution of superconductivity under pressure

  Transport and magnetic studies of PbTaSe$_2$ under pressure suggest existenceof two superconducting phases with the low temperature phase boundary at $\sim0.25$ GPa that is defined by a very sharp, first order, phase transition. Thefirst order phase transition line can be followed via pressure dependentresistivity measurements, and is found to be near 0.12 GPa near roomtemperature. Transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction at elevatedtemperatures confirm that this first order phase transition is structural andoccurs at ambient pressure near $\sim 425$ K. The new, high temperature / highpressure phase has a similar crystal structure and slightly lower unit cellvolume relative to the ambient pressure, room temperature structure. Based onfirst-principles calculations this structure is suggested to be obtained byshifting the Pb atoms from the $1a$ to $1e$ Wyckoff position without changingthe positions of Ta and Se atoms. PbTaSe$_2$ has an exceptionally pressuresensitive, structural phase transition with $\Delta T_s/\Delta P \approx -1700$ K/GPa near 4 K, this first order transition causes an $\sim 1$ K ($\sim25 \%$) step - like decrease in $T_c$ as pressure is increased through 0.25GPa.

Leveraging local h-index to identify and rank influential spreaders in  networks

  Identifying influential nodes in complex networks has received increasingattention for its great theoretical and practical applications in many fields.Traditional methods, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality,closeness centrality, and coreness centrality, have more or less disadvantagesin detecting influential nodes, which have been illustrated in relatedliteratures. Recently, the h-index, which is utilized to measure both theproductivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar,has been introduced to the network world to evaluate a node's spreadingability. However, this method assigns too many nodes with the same value, whichleads to a resolution limit problem in distinguishing the real influence ofthese nodes. In this paper, we propose a local h-index centrality (LH-index)method for identifying and ranking influential nodes in networks. The LH-indexmethod simultaneously takes into account of h-index values of the node itselfand its neighbors, which is based on the idea that a node connects to moreinfluential nodes will also be influential. According to the simulation resultswith the stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in four realworld networks and several simulated networks, we demonstrate the effectivityof the LH-index method in identifying influential nodes in networks.

Fine-Grained Car Detection for Visual Census Estimation

  Targeted socioeconomic policies require an accurate understanding of acountry's demographic makeup. To that end, the United States spends more than 1billion dollars a year gathering census data such as race, gender, education,occupation and unemployment rates. Compared to the traditional method ofcollecting surveys across many years which is costly and labor intensive,data-driven, machine learning driven approaches are cheaper and faster--withthe potential ability to detect trends in close to real time. In this work, weleverage the ubiquity of Google Street View images and develop a computervision pipeline to predict income, per capita carbon emission, crime rates andother city attributes from a single source of publicly available visual data.We first detect cars in 50 million images across 200 of the largest US citiesand train a model to predict demographic attributes using the detected cars. Tofacilitate our work, we have collected the largest and most challengingfine-grained dataset reported to date consisting of over 2600 classes of carscomprised of images from Google Street View and other web sources, classifiedby car experts to account for even the most subtle of visual differences. Weuse this data to construct the largest scale fine-grained detection systemreported to date. Our prediction results correlate well with ground truthincome data (r=0.82), Massachusetts department of vehicle registration, andsources investigating crime rates, income segregation, per capita carbonemission, and other market research. Finally, we learn interestingrelationships between cars and neighborhoods allowing us to perform the firstlarge scale sociological analysis of cities using computer vision techniques.

Inferring users' preferences through leveraging their social  relationships

  Recommender systems, inferring users' preferences from their historicalactivities and personal profiles, have been an enormous success in the lastseveral years. Most of the existing works are based on the similarities ofusers, objects or both that derived from their purchases records in the onlineshopping platforms. Such approaches, however, are facing bottlenecks when theknown information is limited. The extreme case is how to recommend products tonew users, namely the so-called cold-start problem. The rise of the onlinesocial networks gives us a chance to break the glass ceiling. Birds of afeather flock together. Close friends may have similar hidden pattern ofselecting products and the advices from friends are more trustworthy.  In this paper, we integrate the individual's social relationships intorecommender systems and propose a new method, called Social Mass Diffusion(SMD), based on a mass diffusion process in the combined network of users'social network and user-item bipartite network. The results show that the SMDalgorithm can achieve higher recommendation accuracy than the Mass Diffusion(MD) purely on the bipartite network. Especially, the improvement is strikingfor small degree users. Moreover, SMD provides a good solution to thecold-start problem. The recommendation accuracy for new users significantlyhigher than that of the conventional popularity-based algorithm. These resultsmay shed some light on the new designs of better personalized recommendersystems and information services.
