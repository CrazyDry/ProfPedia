A Bayesian Approach to Tackling Hard Computational Problems

  We are developing a general framework for using learned Bayesian models for
decision-theoretic control of search and reasoningalgorithms. We illustrate the
approach on the specific task of controlling both general and domain-specific
solvers on a hard class of structured constraint satisfaction problems. A
successful strategyfor reducing the high (and even infinite) variance in
running time typically exhibited by backtracking search algorithms is to cut
off and restart the search if a solution is not found within a certainamount of
time. Previous work on restart strategies have employed fixed cut off values.
We show how to create a dynamic cut off strategy by learning a Bayesian model
that predicts the ultimate length of a trial based on observing the early
behavior of the search algorithm. Furthermore, we describe the general
conditions under which a dynamic restart strategy can outperform the
theoretically optimal fixed strategy.


Tales of Two Cities: Using Social Media to Understand Idiosyncratic
  Lifestyles in Distinctive Metropolitan Areas

  Lifestyles are a valuable model for understanding individuals' physical and
mental lives, comparing social groups, and making recommendations for improving
people's lives. In this paper, we examine and compare lifestyle behaviors of
people living in cities of different sizes, utilizing freely available social
media data as a large-scale, low-cost alternative to traditional survey
methods. We use the Greater New York City area as a representative for large
cities, and the Greater Rochester area as a representative for smaller cities
in the United States. We employed matrix factor analysis as an unsupervised
method to extract salient mobility and work-rest patterns for a large
population of users within each metropolitan area. We discovered interesting
human behavior patterns at both a larger scale and a finer granularity than is
present in previous literature, some of which allow us to quantitatively
compare the behaviors of individuals of living in big cities to those living in
small cities. We believe that our social media-based approach to lifestyle
analysis represents a powerful tool for social computing in the big data age.


Analyzing Uncivil Speech Provocation and Implicit Topics in Online
  Political News

  Online news has made dissemination of information a faster and more efficient
process. Additionally, the shift from a print medium to an online interface has
enabled user interactions, creating a space to mutually understand the reader
responses generated by the consumption of news articles. Intermittently, the
positive environment is transformed into a hate-spewing contest, with the
amount and target of incivility varying depending on the specific news website
in question. In this paper, we develop methods to study the emergence of
incivility within the reader communities in news sites. First, we create a
dataset of political news articles and their reader comments from partisan news
sites. Then, we train classifiers to predict different aspects of uncivil
speech in comments. We apply these classifiers to predict whether a news
article is likely to provoke a substantial portion of reader comments
containing uncivil language by analyzing only the article's content. Finally,
we devise a technique to "read between the lines" --- finding the topics of
discussions that an article triggers among its readers without frequent,
explicit mentions of these topics in its content.


Job-related discourse on social media

  Working adults spend nearly one third of their daily time at their jobs. In
this paper, we study job-related social media discourse from a community of
users. We use both crowdsourcing and local expertise to train a classifier to
detect job-related messages on Twitter. Additionally, we analyze the linguistic
differences in a job-related corpus of tweets between individual users vs.
commercial accounts. The volumes of job-related tweets from individual users
indicate that people use Twitter with distinct monthly, daily, and hourly
patterns. We further show that the moods associated with jobs, positive and
negative, have unique diurnal rhythms.


Reasoning Under the Principle of Maximum Entropy for Modal Logics K45,
  KD45, and S5

  We propose modal Markov logic as an extension of propositional Markov logic
to reason under the principle of maximum entropy for modal logics K45, KD45,
and S5. Analogous to propositional Markov logic, the knowledge base consists of
weighted formulas, whose weights are learned from data. However, in contrast to
Markov logic, in our framework we use the knowledge base to define a
probability distribution over non-equivalent epistemic situations (pointed
Kripke structures) rather than over atoms, and use this distribution to assign
probabilities to modal formulas. As in all probabilistic representations, the
central task in our framework is inference. Although the size of the state
space grows doubly exponentially in the number of propositions in the domain,
we provide an algorithm that scales only exponentially in the size of the
knowledge base. Finally, we briefly discuss the case of languages with an
infinite number of propositions.


Predicting Acute Kidney Injury at Hospital Re-entry Using
  High-dimensional Electronic Health Record Data

  Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a sudden decline in kidney function, is associated
with increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and hospital cost. Since
AKI is sometimes preventable, there is great interest in prediction. Most
existing studies consider all patients and therefore restrict to features
available in the first hours of hospitalization. Here, the focus is instead on
rehospitalized patients, a cohort in which rich longitudinal features from
prior hospitalizations can be analyzed. Our objective is to provide a risk
score directly at hospital re-entry. Gradient boosting, penalized logistic
regression (with and without stability selection), and a recurrent neural
network are trained on two years of adult inpatient EHR data (3,387 attributes
for 34,505 patients who generated 90,013 training samples with 5,618 cases and
84,395 controls). Predictions are internally evaluated with 50 iterations of
5-fold grouped cross-validation with special emphasis on calibration, an
analysis of which is performed at the patient as well as hospitalization level.
Error is assessed with respect to diagnosis, race, age, gender, AKI
identification method, and hospital utilization. In an additional experiment,
the regularization penalty is severely increased to induce parsimony and
interpretability. Predictors identified for rehospitalized patients are also
reported with a special analysis of medications that might be modifiable risk
factors. Insights from this study might be used to construct a predictive tool
for AKI in rehospitalized patients. An accurate estimate of AKI risk at
hospital entry might serve as a prior for an admitting provider or another
predictive algorithm.


Inferring Fine-grained Details on User Activities and Home Location from
  Social Media: Detecting Drinking-While-Tweeting Patterns in Communities

  Nearly all previous work on geo-locating latent states and activities from
social media confounds general discussions about activities, self-reports of
users participating in those activities at times in the past or future, and
self-reports made at the immediate time and place the activity occurs.
Activities, such as alcohol consumption, may occur at different places and
types of places, and it is important not only to detect the local regions where
these activities occur, but also to analyze the degree of participation in them
by local residents. In this paper, we develop new machine learning based
methods for fine-grained localization of activities and home locations from
Twitter data. We apply these methods to discover and compare alcohol
consumption patterns in a large urban area, New York City, and a more suburban
and rural area, Monroe County. We find positive correlations between the rate
of alcohol consumption reported among a community's Twitter users and the
density of alcohol outlets, demonstrating that the degree of correlation varies
significantly between urban and suburban areas. While our experiments are
focused on alcohol use, our methods for locating homes and distinguishing
temporally-specific self-reports are applicable to a broad range of behaviors
and latent states.


Location-Based Reasoning about Complex Multi-Agent Behavior

  Recent research has shown that surprisingly rich models of human activity can
be learned from GPS (positional) data. However, most effort to date has
concentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical properties of groups
of people. Moreover, prior work focused solely on modeling actual successful
executions (and not failed or attempted executions) of the activities of
interest. We, in contrast, take on the task of understanding human
interactions, attempted interactions, and intentions from noisy sensor data in
a fully relational multi-agent setting. We use a real-world game of capture the
flag to illustrate our approach in a well-defined domain that involves many
distinct cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain
using Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory that
jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, such
as a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model combines constraints imposed
by the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by the
rules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound
fashion. We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a
multi-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the
activity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future
behaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded
it. Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed multi-agent
activities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts at the same
activities, our system automatically learns an augmented model that is capable
of recognizing success and failure, as well as goals of peoples actions with
high accuracy. We compare our approach with other alternatives and show that
our unified model, which takes into account not only relationships among
individual players, but also relationships among activities over the entire
length of a game, although more computationally costly, is significantly more
accurate. Finally, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling unsuccessful
attempts boosts performance on other important recognition tasks.
