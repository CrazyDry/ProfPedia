Observation of Multi-Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in V-type  Rubidium atoms

  A detailed experimental investigation and theoretical analysis have been madein the V-type 85Rb atomic medium. Seven induced transparency windows, includinga central double-peak-structure, have been observed experimentally when acoupling field and a probe field are applied into the ground and first excitedstates. By taking into account the hyperfine splitting of the excited state,our theoretical analysis gives good explanation for the observed phenomena.

Laser frequency offset locking via tripod-type electromagnetically  induced transparency

  We have demonstrated the laser frequency offset locking via the Rbtripod-type double dark resonances electromagnetically induced transparency(EIT) system. The influence of coupling fields power and detuning on thetripod-type EIT profile is detailed studied. In a wide coupling fields detuningrange, the narrower EIT dip has an ultranarrow linewidth of 590 KHz, which isabout one order narrower than the natural linewidth of Rb. Without theadditional frequency stabilization of the coupling lasers, we achieve therelative frequency fluctuation of 60 KHz in a long time of ~2000s, which isnarrower than the short-time linewidth of each individual laser.

Realization of cavity linewidth narrowing via interacting dark  resonances in a tripod-type electromagnetically induced transparency system

  Cavity linewidth narrowing via double-dark resonances has been experimentallyobserved using the 87Rb Zeeman splitting sublevels. With the steep dispersionled by the interacting dark resonances in the tripodtype electromagneticallyinduced transparency system, we narrow the cavity linewidth to 250 KHz at roomtemperature. Furthermore, the position of this ultranarrow cavity linewidthcould be tuned in a 60 MHz coupling field detuning range.

On Optimal Locally Repairable Codes with Super-Linear Length

  Locally repairable codes which are optimal with respect to the boundpresented by Prakash et al. are considered. New upper bounds on the length ofsuch optimal codes are derived. The new bounds both improve and generalizepreviously known bounds. Optimal codes are constructed, whose length isorder-optimal when compared with the new upper bounds. The length of the codesis super-linear in the alphabet size.

Plasmonic Tamm states: second enhancement of light inside the plasmonic  waveguide

  A type of Tamm states inside metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides isproposed. An impedance based transfer matrix method is adopted to study andoptimize it. With the participation of the plasmonic Tamm states, fields couldbe enhanced twice: the ffirst is due to the coupling between a normal waveguideand a nanoscaled plasmonic waveguide and the second is due to the stronglocalization and field enhancement of Tamm states. As shown in our 2D couplingconfiguration, |E|^2 is enhanced up to 1050 times when 1550 nm light is coupledfrom an 300 nm Si slab waveguide into an 40 nm MIM waveguide.

Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy with Vandermonde  Factorization

  Multi-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an important tool forstudying molecular structures, interactions and dynamics in bio-engineering.The data acquisition time, however, is relatively long and non-uniform samplingcan be applied to reduce this time. To obtain the full spectrum,areconstruction method with Vandermonde factorization is proposed.This methodexplores the general signal property in magnetic resonance spectroscopy: Itstime domain signal is approximated by a sum of a few exponentials. Results onsynthetic and realistic data show that the new approach can achieve faithfulspectrum reconstruction and outperforms state-of-the-art low rank Hankel matrixmethod.

An entropic fourier method for the Boltzmann equation

  We propose an entropic Fourier method for the numerical discretization of theBoltzmann collision operator. The method, which is obtained by modifying aFourier Galerkin method to match the form of the discrete velocity method, canbe viewed both as a discrete velocity method and as a Fourier method. As adiscrete velocity method, it preserves the positivity of the solution andsatisfies a discrete version of the H-theorem. As a Fourier method, it allowsone to readily apply the FFT-based fast algorithms. A second-order convergencerate is validated by numerical experiments

$Z'$ Phenomenology: A Model-independent Analysis and Fit in Combination  of Chiral Effective Theory and Anomaly Cancellation

  To investigate $Z'$ phenomenology model-independent, we combine chiraleffective theory with anomaly cancellation conditions without any other modelinput. We focus on $Z'$ mixings with $\gamma-Z$ in both mass and kinetic partsand calculate contributions to oblique $S,T,U$. The three sets of anomaly-freefermion $U(1)'$ charges parameterize the $Z'$ interactions with fermions. Thecancellation of the $[U(1)']^3$ anomaly and mixing gravitational-gauge anomalydetermines the number of right-handed neutrinos. We also find a novel relationbetween the charge assignments and Stueckelberg coupling in terms of therenormalized electromagnetic current. A global fit to the electroweak preciseobservables shows that typical values for the mixing parameters are of order$10^{-3}$. In spite of this strict limit, we obtain a negative $S$ parametercontribution.

Dislocations and the enhancement of superconductivity in odd-parity  superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$

  We report observation of the enhancement of superconductivity near latticedislocations and the absence of the strengthening of vortex pinning inodd-parity superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, both surprising results in directcontrast to the well known sensitivity of superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ todisorder. The enhanced superconductivity appears to be related fundamentally tothe two-component nature of the superconducting order parameter, as revealed inour phenomenological theory taking into account the effect of symmetryreduction near a dislocation.

Tunable frequency reference by optical pumping-assisted intracavity  V-type electromagnetically induced transparency

  A tunable high resolution frequency reference is constructed using thenarrowed cavity-linewidth by the optical pumping-assisted V-typeelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). At room temperature, theoptical pumping effect will increase the transparency for the V-type EIT andtherefore the cavity-linewidth can be narrowed apparently. For the seven EITsobserved in our previous study, cavity-linewidth narrowing is observed in allof them. More importantly, we find that the cavity-linewidth can keep at 1.2MHzin a wide frequency range of 100MHz by utilizing the central EIT. This propertyprovides a novel way for constructing high resolution tunable frequencyreference via the intracavity EIT.

Majoranas in Noisy Kitaev Wires

  Robustness of edge states and non-Abelian excitations of topological statesof matter promises quantum memory and quantum processing, which is naturallyimmune against microscopic imperfections such as static disorder. However,topological properties will not in general protect quantum system fromtime-dependent disorder or noise. Here we take the example of a network ofKitaev wires with Majorana edge modes storing qubits to investigate the effectsof classical noise in the crossover from the quasi-static to the fastfluctuation regime. We present detailed results for the Majorana edgecorrelations, and fidelity of braiding operations for both global and localnoise sources preserving parity symmetry, such as random chemical potentialsand phase fluctuations. While in general noise will induce heating anddephasing, we identify examples of long-lived quantum correlations in presenceof fast noise due to motional narrowing, where external noise drives the systemrapidly between the topological and non-topological phases.

Structural and metal-insulator transitions in ionic liquid-gated  Ca3Ru2O7 surface

  We report the fabrication and measurements of ionic liquid gated Hall bardevices prepared on thin Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ flakes exfoliated from bulk singlecrystals that were grown by a floating zone method. Two types of devices withtheir electrical transport properties dominated by $c$-axis transport in Type Aor that of the in-plane in Type B devices, were prepared. Bulk physicalphenomena, including a magnetic transition near 56 K, a structural andmetal-insulator transition at a slightly lower temperature, as well as theemergence of a highly unusual metallic state as the temperature is furtherlowered, were found in both types of devices. However, the Shubnikov-de Haasoscillations were found in Type A but not Type B devices, most likely due toenhanced disorder on the flake surface. Finally, the ionic liquid gating of aType B device revealed a shift in critical temperature of the structural andmetal-insulator transitions, suggesting that such transitions can be tuned bythe electric field effect.

Magnetoresistance oscillations and the half-flux-quantum state in  spin-triplet superconductor Sr2RuO4

  We report results of our low-temperature magneto electric transportmeasurements on micron-sized short cylinders of odd-parity, spin-tripletsuperconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with the cylinder axis along the $c$ axis. Thein-plane magnetic field and measurement current dependent magnetoresistanceoscillations were found to feature an amplitude much larger than that expectedfrom the conventional Little-Parks effect, suggesting that themagnetoresistance oscillations originate from vortex crossing. The free-energybarrier that controls the vortex crossing was modulated by the magnetic fluxenclosed in the cylinder, the in-plane field, measurement current, andstructural factors. Distinct features on magnetoresistance peaks were found,which we argue to be related to the emergence of half-flux quantum states, butonly in samples for which the vortex crossing is confined at specific parts ofthe sample.

Peak-Aware Online Economic Dispatching for Microgrids

  By employing local renewable energy sources and power generation units whileconnected to the central grid, microgrid can usher in great benefits in termsof cost efficiency, power reliability, and environmental awareness. Economicdispatching is a central problem in microgrid operation, which aims ateffectively scheduling various energy sources to minimize the operating costwhile satisfying the electricity demand. Designing intelligent economicdispatching strategies for microgrids, however, is drastically different fromthat for conventional central grids, due to two unique challenges. First, theerratic renewable energy emphasizes the need for online algorithms. Second, thewidely-adopted peak-based pricing scheme brings out the need for new peak-awarestrategy design. In this paper, we tackle these critical challenges and devisepeak-aware online economic dispatching algorithms. For microgrids withfast-responding generators, we prove that our deterministic and randomizedalgorithms achieve the best possible competitive ratios $2-\beta$ and$e/(e-1+\beta)$, respectively, where $\beta\in[0,1]$ is the ratio between theminimum grid spot price and the local-generation price. Our resultscharacterize the fundamental \emph{price of uncertainty} of the problem. Formicrogrids with slow-responding generators, we first show that a largecompetitive ratio is inevitable. Then we leverage limited prediction ofelectricity demand and renewable generation to improve the competitiveness ofthe algorithms. By extensive empirical evaluations using real-world traces, weshow that our online algorithms achieve near offline-optimal performance. In arepresentative scenario, our algorithm achieves $17.5\%$ and $9.24\%$ costreduction as compared to the case without local generation units and the caseusing peak-oblivious algorithms, respectively.

Unconventional quantum oscillations in mesoscopic rings of spin-triplet  superconductor Sr2RuO4

  Odd-parity, spin-triplet superconductor Sr2RuO4 has been found to featureexotic vortex physics including half-flux quanta trapped in a doubly connectedsample and the formation of vortex lattices at low fields. The consequences ofthese vortex states on the low-temperature magnetoresistive behavior ofmesoscopic samples of Sr2RuO4 were investigated in this work using ring devicefabricated on mechanically exfoliated single crystals of Sr2RuO4 byphotolithography and focused ion beam. With the magnetic field appliedperpendicular to the in-plane direction, thin-wall rings of Sr2RuO4 were foundto exhibit pronounced quantum oscillations with a conventional period of thefull-flux quantum even though the unexpectedly large amplitude and the numberof oscillations suggest the observation of vortex-flow-dominatedmagnetoresistance oscillations rather than a conventional Little-Parks effect.For rings with a thick wall, two distinct periods of quantum oscillations werefound in high and low field regimes, respectively, which we argue to beassociated with the "lock-in" of a vortex lattice in these thick-wall rings. Noevidence for half-flux-quantum resistance oscillations were identified in anysample measured so far without the presence of an in-plane field.

Utilizing RNA-Seq Data for Cancer Network Inference

  An important challenge in cancer systems biology is to uncover the complexnetwork of interactions between genes (tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes)implicated in cancer. Next generation sequencing provides unparalleled abilityto probe the expression levels of the entire set of cancer genes and theirtranscript isoforms. However, there are onerous statistical and computationalissues in interpreting high-dimensional sequencing data and inferring theunderlying genetic network. In this study, we analyzed RNA-Seq data fromlymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a population of 69 human individuals andimplemented a probabilistic framework to construct biologically-relevantgenetic networks. In particular, we employed a graphical lasso analysis,motivated by considerations of the maximum entropy formalism, to estimate thesparse inverse covariance matrix of RNA-Seq data. Gene ontology, pathwayenrichment and protein-protein path length analysis were all carried out tovalidate the biological context of the predicted network of interacting cancergene isoforms.

Diquark mass differences from unquenched lattice QCD

  We calculate diquark correlation functions in the Landau gauge on the latticeusing overlap valence quarks and 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations.Quark masses are extracted from the scalar part of quark propagators in theLandau gauge. Scalar diquark quark mass difference and axial vector scalardiquark mass difference are obtained for diquarks composed of two light quarksand of a strange and a light quark. Light sea quark mass dependence of theresults is examined. Two lattice spacings are used to check the discretizationeffects. The coarse and fine lattices are of sizes $24^3\times64$ and$32^3\times64$ with inverse spacings $1/a=1.75(4) {\rm~GeV}$ and $2.33(5){\rm~GeV}$, respectively.

Hankel Matrix Nuclear Norm Regularized Tensor Completion for  $N$-dimensional Exponential Signals

  Signals are generally modeled as a superposition of exponential functions inspectroscopy of chemistry, biology and medical imaging. For fast dataacquisition or other inevitable reasons, however, only a small amount ofsamples may be acquired and thus how to recover the full signal becomes anactive research topic. But existing approaches can not efficiently recover$N$-dimensional exponential signals with $N\geq 3$. In this paper, we study theproblem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly $N\geq 3$) exponentialsignals from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-ranktensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal isreconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC structure andthe exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter ispromoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm ofHankel matrices. Experimental results on simulated and real magnetic resonancespectroscopy data show that the proposed approach can successfully recover fullsignals from very limited samples and is robust to the estimated tensor rank.

A centrosymmetric hexagonal magnet with superstable biskyrmion magnetic  nanodomains in a wide temperature range of 100K to 340K

  Here, we report on the experimental discovery of biskyrmion magneticnanodomains at RT and the observation of a biskyrmion-derived topological Halleffect (THE) in the centrosymmetric hexagonal MnNiGa magnet. Using a phasereconstruction technique based on a transport-of-intensity equation (TIE), weestablished the texture of the biskyrmion spin. Results from Lorentztransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the topological Hall effect revealedthat the biskyrmion phase is stable over a much wider temperature range (100 Kto ~340K) and a larger magnetic field range in our material than inskyrmion-hosting bulk crystals reported previously[1-3,6]. The super-wideoperating temperature and the broad range of material options indicateimportant progress toward the realization of skyrmion-based spintronic devices.

Boron Nitride Nanosheet Veiled Gold Nanoparticles for Surface Enhanced  Raman Scattering

  Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) nanosheets have many properties desirablefor surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). BN nanosheets have a strongsurface adsorption capability towards airborne hydrocarbon and aromaticmolecules. For maximized adsorption area and hence SERS sensitivity, atomicallythin BN nanosheet covered gold nanoparticles have been prepared for the firsttime. When placed on top of metal nanoparticles, atomically thin BN nanosheetsclosely follow their contours so that the plasmonic hot spots are retained.Electrically insulating BN nanosheets also act as a barrier layer to eliminatemetal-induced disturbance in SERS. Moreover, the SERS substrates veiled by BNnanosheets show an outstanding reusability in the long term. As the result, thesensitivity, reproducibility and reusability of SERS substrates can be greatlyimproved. We also demonstrate that large BN nanosheets produced by chemicalvapor deposition can be used to scale up the proposed SERS substrate forpractical application.

Boron Nitride Nanosheets Improve Sensitivity and Reusability of Surface  Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy

  Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a useful multidisciplinaryanalytic technique. However, it is still a challenge to produce SERS substratesthat are highly sensitive, reproducible, stable, reusable, and scalable. Here,we demonstrate that atomically thin boron nitride (BN) nanosheets have manyunique and desirable properties to help solve this challenge. The synergiceffect of the atomic thickness, high flexibility, stronger surface adsorptioncapability, electrical insulation, impermeability, high thermal and chemicalstability of BN nanosheets can increase the Raman sensitivity by up to twoorders, and in the meantime attain long-term stability and extraordinaryreusability not achievable by other materials. These advances will greatlyfacilitate the wider use of SERS in many fields.

Product-based Neural Networks for User Response Prediction

  Predicting user responses, such as clicks and conversions, is of greatimportance and has found its usage in many Web applications includingrecommender systems, web search and online advertising. The data in thoseapplications is mostly categorical and contains multiple fields; a typicalrepresentation is to transform it into a high-dimensional sparse binary featurerepresentation via one-hot encoding. Facing with the extreme sparsity,traditional models may limit their capacity of mining shallow patterns from thedata, i.e. low-order feature combinations. Deep models like deep neuralnetworks, on the other hand, cannot be directly applied for thehigh-dimensional input because of the huge feature space. In this paper, wepropose a Product-based Neural Networks (PNN) with an embedding layer to learna distributed representation of the categorical data, a product layer tocapture interactive patterns between inter-field categories, and further fullyconnected layers to explore high-order feature interactions. Our experimentalresults on two large-scale real-world ad click datasets demonstrate that PNNsconsistently outperform the state-of-the-art models on various metrics.

Molecule-Induced Conformational Change in Boron Nitride Nanosheets with  Enhanced Surface Adsorption

  Surface interaction is extremely important to both fundamental research andpractical application. Physisorption can induce shape and structural distortion(i.e. conformational changes) in macromolecular and biomolecular adsorbates,but such phenomenon has rarely been observed on adsorbents. Here, wedemonstrate theoretically and experimentally that atomically thin boron nitride(BN) nanosheets as an adsorbent experience conformational changes upon surfaceadsorption of molecules, increasing adsorption energy and efficiency. The studynot only provides new perspectives on the strong adsorption capability of BNnanosheets and many other two-dimensional nanomaterials but also opens uppossibilities for many novel applications. For example, we demonstrate that BNnanosheets with the same surface area as bulk hBN particles are more effectivein purification and sensing.

Quark chiral condensate from the overlap quark propagator

  From the overlap lattice quark propagator calculated in the Landau gauge, wedetermine the quark chiral condensate by fitting operator product expansionformulas to the lattice data. The quark propagators are computed on domain wallfermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations with $N_f=2+1$flavors. Three ensembles with different light sea quark masses are used at onelattice spacing $1/a=1.75(4)$ GeV. We obtain$\langle\bar\psi\psi\rangle^{\overline{\rm MS}}(2\mbox{GeV})=(-305(15)(21)\mbox{ MeV})^3$ in the SU(2) chiral limit.

RI/MOM and RI/SMOM renormalization of overlap quark bilinears on domain  wall fermion configurations

  Renormalization constants (RCs) of overlap quark bilinear operators on2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations are calculated by using theRI/MOM and RI/SMOM schemes. The scale independent RC for the axial vectorcurrent is computed by using a Ward identity. Then the RCs for the quark fieldand the vector, tensor, scalar and pseudoscalar operators are calculated inboth the RI/MOM and RI/SMOM schemes. The RCs are converted to the$\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme and we compare the numerical results from using thetwo intermediate schemes. The lattice size is $48^3\times96$ and the inversespacing $1/a = 1.730(4) {\rm~GeV}$.

Hunting micrometer-sized graphene flakes on gold substrate

  Gold is widely used as the substrate material in many graphene devices, dueto its superior optoelectronic properties and chemical stability. However,there has been little experimental investigation on the optical contrast ofgraphene films on Au substrates. Here we report accurate measurement of theoptical contrast spectra of few-layer graphene flakes on bulk Au. We used ahigh-resolution optical microscopy with a 100x magnification objective,accurately determining the thickness of flakes as small as one micrometer inlateral size, which are highly desired in many applications. The results are inexcellent agreement with theoretical calculations and confirmed by Raman andAFM measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optical contrastspectroscopy is sensitive enough to detect the adsorption of a sub-monolayerairborne hydrocarbon molecules, which can reveal whether graphene iscon-taminated and opens the opportunity to develop miniaturized andultrasensitive molecular sensors.

Medical Concept Embedding with Time-Aware Attention

  Embeddings of medical concepts such as medication, procedure and diagnosiscodes in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are central to healthcare analytics.Previous work on medical concept embedding takes medical concepts and EMRs aswords and documents respectively. Nevertheless, such models miss out thetemporal nature of EMR data. On the one hand, two consecutive medical conceptsdo not indicate they are temporally close, but the correlations between themcan be revealed by the time gap. On the other hand, the temporal scopes ofmedical concepts often vary greatly (e.g., \textit{common cold} and\textit{diabetes}). In this paper, we propose to incorporate the temporalinformation to embed medical codes. Based on the Continuous Bag-of-Words model,we employ the attention mechanism to learn a "soft" time-aware context windowfor each medical concept. Experiments on public and proprietary datasetsthrough clustering and nearest neighbour search tasks demonstrate theeffectiveness of our model, showing that it outperforms five state-of-the-artbaselines.

Vandermonde Factorization of Hankel Matrix for Complex Exponential  Signal Recovery -- Application in Fast NMR Spectroscopy

  Many signals are modeled as a superposition of exponential functions inspectroscopy of chemistry, biology and medical imaging. This paper studies theproblem of recovering exponential signals from a random subset of samples. Weexploit the Vandermonde structure of the Hankel matrix formed by theexponential signal and formulate signal recovery as Hankel matrix completionwith Vandermonde factorization (HVaF). A numerical algorithm is developed tosolve the proposed model and its sequence convergence is analyzedtheoretically. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that HVaF succeedsover a wider regime than the state-of-the-art nuclear-normminimization-basedHankel matrix completion method, while has a less restriction on frequencyseparation than the state-of-the-art atomic norm minimization and fastiterative hard thresholding methods. The effectiveness of HVaF is furthervalidated on biological magnetic resonance spectroscopy data.

Phase-mediated magnon chaos-order transition in cavity optomagnonics

  Magnon as a quantized spin wave has attracted extensive attentions in variousfields of physics, such as magnon spintronics, microwave photonics, and cavityquantum electrodynamics. Here, we explore theoretically magnon chaos-ordertransition in cavity optomagnonics, which is still remains largely unexploredin this emerging field. We find that the evolution of the magnon experiencesthe transition from order to period-doubling bifurcation and finally enterchaos by adjusting the microwave driving power. Different from the normalchaos, the magnon chaos-order transition proposed here is phase-mediated.Beyond their fundamental scientific significance, our results will contributeto the comprehending of nonlinear phenomena and chaos in optomagnonical system,and may find applications in chaos-based secure communication.

SingleGAN: Image-to-Image Translation by a Single-Generator Network  using Multiple Generative Adversarial Learning

  Image translation is a burgeoning field in computer vision where the goal isto learn the mapping between an input image and an output image. However, mostrecent methods require multiple generators for modeling different domainmappings, which are inefficient and ineffective on some multi-domain imagetranslation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, SingleGAN, toperform multi-domain image-to-image translations with a single generator. Weintroduce the domain code to explicitly control the different generative tasksand integrate multiple optimization goals to ensure the translation.Experimental results on several unpaired datasets show superior performance ofour model in translation between two domains. Besides, we explore variants ofSingleGAN for different tasks, including one-to-many domain translation,many-to-many domain translation and one-to-one domain translation withmultimodality. The extended experiments show the universality and extensibilityof our model.

Learning of Content Knowledge and Development of Scientific Reasoning  Ability: A Cross Culture Comparison

  Student content knowledge and general reasoning abilities are two importantareas in education practice and research. However, there hasn't been much workin physics education that clearly documents the possible interactions betweencontent learning and the development of general reasoning abilities. In thispaper, we report one study of a systematic research to investigate the possibleinteractions between students' learning of physics content knowledge and thedevelopment of general scientific reasoning abilities. Specifically, this studyseeks to answer the research question of whether and to what extent contentlearning may affect the development of general reasoning abilities. Collegeentrance testing data of freshman college students in both USA and China werecollected using three standardized tests, FCI, BEMA, and Lawson's ClassroomTest of Scientific Reasoning (Lawson Test). The results suggest that years ofrigorous training of physics knowledge in middle and high schools have madesignificant impact on Chinese students' ability in solving physics problems,while such training doesn't seem to have direct effects on their generalability in scientific reasoning, which was measured to be at the same level asthat of the students in USA. Details of the curriculum structures in theeducation systems of USA and China are also compared to provide a basis forinterpreting the assessment data.

Boron Nitride Nanosheets as Improved and Reusable Substrates for Gold  Nanoparticles Enabled Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy

  Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) nanosheets have been found an excellentsubstrate for noble metal particles enabled surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy(SERS), thanks to their good adsorption of aromatic molecules, high thermalstability and weak Raman scattering. Faceted gold (Au) nanoparticles have beensynthesized on BN nanosheets by a simple but controllable and reproduciblesputtering and annealing method. The size and density of the Au particles canbe controlled by sputtering time, current and annealing temperature etc. Underthe same sputtering and annealing conditions, the Au particles on BN ofdifferent thicknesses show various sizes because the surface diffusioncoefficients of Au depends on the thickness of BN. Intriguingly, decorated withsimilar morphology and distribution of Au particles, BN nanosheets exhibitbetter Raman enhancements than silicon substrate as well as bulk BN crystals.Additionally, BN nanosheets show no noticeable SERS signal and hence cause nointerference to the Raman signal of analyte. The Au/BN substrates can be reusedby heating in air to remove adsorbed analyte without loss of SERS enhancement.

Local noncentrosymmetricity and possible spin-momentum locking in  Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$

  Strong spin-orbital coupling (SOC) was found previously to lead to dramaticeffects in quantum materials, such as those found in topological insulators. Itwas shown theoretically that local noncentrosymmetricity resulting from therotation of RuO$_6$ octahedral in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ will also give rise to aneffective SOC\cite{SocSr327,MicroscopicnematicSr327}. In the presence of amagnetic field applied along a specific in-plane direction, the Fermi surfacewas predicted to undergo a reconstruction. Here we report results of ourin-plane magnetoresistivity and magnetothermopower measurements on singlecrystals of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with an electrical or a thermal current appliedalong specific crystalline directions and a magnetic field rotating in the $ab$plane (Fig. 1a), showing a minimal value for field directions predicted by thelocal noncentrosymmetricity theory. Furthermore, the thermopower, andtherefore, the electron entropy, were found to be suppressed as the field wasapplied perpendicular to the thermal current, which suggests that the spin andthe momentum in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ are locked over substantial parts of theFermi surface, likely originating from local noncentrosymmetricity as well.

Social contagions on time-varying community networks

  Time-varying community structures widely exist in various real-worldnetworks. However, the spreading dynamics on this kind of network has not beenfully studied. To this end, we systematically study the effects of time-varyingcommunity structures on social contagions. We first propose a non-Markoviansocial contagion model on time-varying community networks based on the activitydriven network model, in which an individual adopts a behavior if and only ifthe accumulated behavioral information it has ever received reaches athreshold. Then, we develop a mean-field theory to describe the proposed model.From theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, we find that behavioradoption in the social contagions exhibits a hierarchical feature, i.e., thebehavior first quickly spreads in one of the communities, and then outbreaks inthe other. Moreover, under different behavioral information transmission rates,the final behavior adoption proportion in the whole network versus thecommunity strength shows one of the patterns, which are a monotone increasingpattern, a non-monotonic changing pattern, and a monotone decreasing pattern.An optimal community strength maximizing the final behavior adoption can befound in a suitable range of behavioral information transmission rate. Finally,for a given average degree, increasing the number of edges generated by activenodes is more beneficial to the social contagions than increasing the averageactivity potential.

Existence of electron and hole pockets and partial gap opening in the  correlated semimetal Ca3Ru2O7

  The electronic band structure of correlated Ca3Ru2O7 featuring anantiferromagnetic as well as a structural transition has been determinedtheoretically at high temperatures, which has led to the understanding of theremarkable properties of Ca3Ru2O7 such as the bulk spin valve effects. However,its band structure and Fermi surface (FS) below the structural transition havenot been resolved even though a FS consisting of electron pockets was foundexperimentally. Here we report magneto electrical transport and thermoelectricmeasurements with the electric current and temper- ature gradient directedalong a and b axes of an untwined single crystal of Ca3Ru2O7 respectively. Thethermopower obtained along the two crystal axes were found to show oppositesigns at low temperatures, demonstrating the presence of both electron and holepockets on the FS. In addition, how the FS evolves across T* = 30 K at which adistinct transition from coherent to incoherent behavior occurs was alsoinferred - the Hall and Nernst coefficient results suggest a temperature andmomentum dependent partial gap opening in Ca3Ru2O7 below the structuraltransition, with a pos- sible Lifshitz transition occurring at T*. Theexperimental demonstration of a correlated semimetal ground state in Ca3Ru2O7calls for further theoretical studies of this remarkable material.

Theoretical investigation of a spectrally pure-state generation from  isomorphs of KDP crystal at near-infrared and telecom wavelengths

  Spectrally uncorrelated biphoton state generated from the spontaneousnonlinear optical process is an important resource for quantum information.Currently such spectrally uncorrelated biphoton state can only be prepared fromlimited kinds of nonlinear media, thus limiting their wavelengths. In order toexplore wider wavelength range, here we theoretically study the generation ofspectrally uncorrelated biphoton state from 14 isomorphs of potassiumdihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystal. We find that 11 crystals from the `KDPfamily' still maintain similar nonlinear optical properties of KDP, such asKDP, DKDP, ADP, DADP, ADA, DADA, RDA, DRDA, RDP, DRDP and KDA, which satisfy 3kinds of the group-velocity matching conditions for spectrally uncorrelatedbiphoton state generation from near-infrared to telecom wavelengths. Based onthe uncorrelated biphoton state, we investigate the generation of heraldedpure-state single photon by detecting one member of the biphoton state toherald the output of the other. The purity of the heralded single photon is ashigh as 0.98 without using a narrow-band filter; the Hong-Ou-Mandelinterference from independent sources can also achieve a visibility of 98%.This study may provide more and better single-photon sources for quantuminformation processing at near-infrared and telecom wavelengths.

Quantifying Inactive Lithium in Lithium Metal Batteries

  Inactive lithium (Li) formation is the immediate cause of capacity loss andcatastrophic failure of Li metal batteries. However, the chemical component andthe atomic level structure of inactive Li have rarely been studied due to thelack of effective diagnosis tools to accurately differentiate and quantify Li+in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) components and the electrically isolatedunreacted metallic Li0, which together comprise the inactive Li. Here, byintroducing a new analytical method, Titration Gas Chromatography (TGC), we canaccurately quantify the contribution from metallic Li0 to the total amount ofinactive Li. We uncover that the Li0, rather than the electrochemically formedSEI, dominates the inactive Li and capacity loss. Using cryogenic electronmicroscopies to further study the microstructure and nanostructure of inactiveLi, we find that the Li0 is surrounded by insulating SEI, losing the electronicconductive pathway to the bulk electrode. Coupling the measurements of the Li0global content to observations of its local atomic structure, we reveal theformation mechanism of inactive Li in different types of electrolytes, andidentify the true underlying cause of low Coulombic efficiency in Li metaldeposition and stripping. We ultimately propose strategies to enable the highlyefficient Li deposition and stripping to enable Li metal anode for nextgeneration high energy batteries.

High thermal conductivity of high-quality monolayer boron nitride and  its thermal expansion

  Heat management becomes more and more critical, especially in miniaturizedmodern devices, so the exploration of highly thermally conductive materialswith electrical insulation and favorable mechanical properties is of greatimportance. Here, we report that high-quality monolayer boron nitride (BN) hasa thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of 751 W/mK at room temperature. Thoughsmaller than that of graphene, this value is larger than that of cubic boronnitride (cBN) and only second to those of diamond and lately discovered cubicboron arsenide (BAs). Monolayer BN has the second largest \k{appa} per unitweight among all semiconductors and insulators, just behind diamond, if densityis considered. The \k{appa} of atomically thin BN decreases with increasedthickness. Our large-scale molecular dynamic simulations using Green-Kuboformalism accurately reproduce this trend, and the density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal the main scattering mechanism. The thermal expansioncoefficients (TECs) of monolayer to trilayer BN at 300-400 K are alsoexperimentally measured, and the results are comparable to atomistic ab initioDFT calculations in a wider range of temperatures. Thanks to its wide bandgap,high thermal conductivity, outstanding strength, good flexibility, andexcellent thermal and chemical stability, atomically thin BN is a strongcandidate for heat dissipation applications, especially in the next generationof flexible electronic devices.

M2Det: A Single-Shot Object Detector based on Multi-Level Feature  Pyramid Network

  Feature pyramids are widely exploited by both the state-of-the-art one-stageobject detectors (e.g., DSSD, RetinaNet, RefineDet) and the two-stage objectdetectors (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DetNet) to alleviate the problem arising fromscale variation across object instances. Although these object detectors withfeature pyramids achieve encouraging results, they have some limitations due tothat they only simply construct the feature pyramid according to the inherentmulti-scale, pyramidal architecture of the backbones which are actuallydesigned for object classification task. Newly, in this work, we present amethod called Multi-Level Feature Pyramid Network (MLFPN) to construct moreeffective feature pyramids for detecting objects of different scales. First, wefuse multi-level features (i.e. multiple layers) extracted by backbone as thebase feature. Second, we feed the base feature into a block of alternatingjoint Thinned U-shape Modules and Feature Fusion Modules and exploit thedecoder layers of each u-shape module as the features for detecting objects.Finally, we gather up the decoder layers with equivalent scales (sizes) todevelop a feature pyramid for object detection, in which every feature mapconsists of the layers (features) from multiple levels. To evaluate theeffectiveness of the proposed MLFPN, we design and train a powerful end-to-endone-stage object detector we call M2Det by integrating it into the architectureof SSD, which gets better detection performance than state-of-the-art one-stagedetectors. Specifically, on MS-COCO benchmark, M2Det achieves AP of 41.0 atspeed of 11.8 FPS with single-scale inference strategy and AP of 44.2 withmulti-scale inference strategy, which is the new state-of-the-art results amongone-stage detectors.

Disappearance of Superconductivity and a Concomitant Lifshitz Transition  in Heavily-Overdoped Bi2Sr2CuO6 Superconductor Revealed by Angle-Resolved  Photoemission Spectroscopy

  By partially doping Pb to effectively suppress the superstructure insingle-layered cuprate Bi2Sr2CuO6+{\delta}(Pb-Bi2201) and annealing them invacuum or in high pressure oxygen atmosphere, a series of high qualityPb-Bi2201 single crystals are obtained with Tc covering from 17 K tonon-supercondcuting in the overdoped region. High resolution angle resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements are carried out on thesesamples to investigate the evolution of the Fermi surface topology with dopingin the normal state. Clear and complete Fermi surface are observed andquantitatively analyzed in all these overdoped Pb-Bi2201 samples. A Lifshitztransition from hole-like Fermi surface to electron like Fermi surface withincreasing doping is observed at a doping level of ~0.35. This transitioncoincides with the change that the sample undergoes from superconducting tonon-superconducting states. Our results reveal the emergence of anelectron-like Fermi surface and the existence of a Lifshitz transition inheavily overdoped Bi2201 samples. They provide important information inunderstanding the connection between the disappearance of superconductivity andthe Lifshitz transition in the overdoped region.

Emergence of Superconductivity from Fully Incoherent Normal State in an  Iron-Based Superconductor (Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$)Fe$_2$As$_2$

  In unconventional superconductors, it is generally believed thatunderstanding the physical properties of the normal state is a pre-requisitefor understanding the superconductivity mechanism. In conventionalsuperconductors like niobium or lead, the normal state is a Fermi liquid with awell-defined Fermi surface and well-defined quasipartcles along the Fermisurface. Superconductivity is realized in this case by the Fermi surfaceinstability in the superconducting state and the formation and condensation ofthe electron pairs (Cooper pairing). The high temperature cupratesuperconductors, on the other hand, represent another extreme case thatsuperconductivity can be realized in the underdoped region where there isneither well-defined Fermi surface due to the pseudogap formation norquasiparticles near the antinodal regions in the normal state. Here we report anovel scenario that superconductivity is realized in a system with well-definedFermi surface but without quasiparticles along the Fermi surface in the normalstate. High resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurementshave been performed on an optimally-doped iron-based superconductor(Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$)Fe$_2$As$_2$. We find that, while sharp superconductingcoherence peaks emerge in the superconducting state on the hole-like Fermisurface sheets, no quasiparticle peak is present in the normal state. Itselectronic behaviours deviate strongly from a Fermi liquid system. Thesuperconducting gap of such a system exhibits an unusual temperature dependencethat it is nearly a constant in the superconducting state and abruptly closesat T$_c$. These observations have provided a new platform to studyunconventional superconductivity in a non-Fermi liquid system.

The DESI Experiment Part I: Science,Targeting, and Survey Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based darkenergy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and thegrowth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxyand quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution,spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. Wewill measure luminous red galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out toeven higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies upto $z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlyingdark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 < z < 3.5$), for theLy-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used totrace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficientobservations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct amagnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 milliongalaxies with a median $z\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxyand quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determinethe matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.
