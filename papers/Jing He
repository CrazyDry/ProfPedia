Binary nonlinearization of the super AKNS system

  We establish the binary nonlinearization approach of the spectral problem ofthe super AKNS system, and then use it to obtain the super finite-dimensionalintegrable Hamiltonian system in supersymmetry manifold $\mathbb{R}^{4N|2N}$.The super Hamiltonian forms and integrals of motion are given explicitly.

Emergent Supersymmetric Many-Body Systems in Doped Z2 Topological Spin  Liquid of the Toric-Code Model

  In this paper, we studied the doped Z2 topological spin liquid of thetoric-code model. We found that the doped holes become supersymmetricparticles. The ground state of the doped Z2 topological spin liquid becomes newmatters of quantum states - supersymmetric Bose-Einstein condensation orsupersymmetric superfluid. As a result, this system provides a unique exampleof manipulatable supersymmetric many-body system.

Electro-Hydrodynamic Shooting Phenomenon of Liquid Metal Stream

  We reported an electro-hydrodynamic shooting phenomenon of liquid metalstream. A small voltage direct current electric field would induce ejection ofliquid metal inside capillary tube and then shooting into sodium hydroxidesolution to form discrete droplets. The shooting velocity has positiverelationship with the applied voltage while the droplet size is dominated bythe aperture diameter of the capillary nozzle. Further, the motion of theliquid metal droplets can be flexibly manipulated by the electrodes. Thiseffect suggests an easy going way to generate metal droplets in large quantity,which is important from both fundamental and practical aspects.

Correlation based entanglement criteria for bipartite systems

  We introduce a class of inequalities based on low order correlations ofoperators to detect entanglement in bipartite systems. The operators may eitherbe Hermitian or non-Hermitian and are applicable to any physical system orclass of states. Testing the criteria on example systems reveals that theyoutperform other common correlation based criteria, such as those byDuan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller and Hillery-Zubairy. One unusual feature of thecriteria is that it includes a term involving the average of the density matrixsquared, related to the purity of the system. We discuss how such a term couldbe measured in relation to the criteria.

What You Say and How You Say it: Joint Modeling of Topics and Discourse  in Microblog Conversations

  This paper presents an unsupervised framework for jointly modeling topiccontent and discourse behavior in microblog conversations. Concretely, wepropose a neural model to discover word clusters indicating what a conversationconcerns (i.e., topics) and those reflecting how participants voice theiropinions (i.e., discourse). Extensive experiments show that our model can yieldboth coherent topics and meaningful discourse behavior. Further study showsthat our topic and discourse representations can benefit the classification ofmicroblog messages, especially when they are jointly trained with theclassifier.

  To classify the finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras with $G= {\rm HS}$or ${\rm Co3}$ we obtain the representatives of conjugacy classes of $G$ andall character tables of centralizers of these representatives by means ofsoftware {\rm GAP}.

Theory of Ferrimagnetism in the Hubbard Model on Bipartite Lattices with  Spectrum Symmetry

  In this paper we developed theory of the ferrimagnetism in the Hubbard modelon bipartite lattices with spectrum symmetry. We then study the defect-inducedferrimagnetic orders in three models and explored the universal features.

Optical generation of hybrid entangled state via entangling  single-photon-added coherent state

  We propose a feasible scheme to realize the optical entanglement ofsingle-photon-added coherent state (SPACS) and show that, besides the Sandersentangled coherent state, the entangled SPACS also leads to new forms of hybridentanglement of quantum Fock state and classical coherent state. We probe theessential difference of two types of hybrid entangled state (HES). This HESprovides a novel link between the discrete- and the continuous-variableentanglement in a natural way.

Binary Nonlinearization of the Super Akns System Under an Implicit  Symmetry Constraint

  For the super AKNS system, an implicit symmetry constraint between thepotentials and the eigenfunctions is proposed. After introducing some newvariables to explicitly express potentials, the super AKNS system is decomposedinto two compatible finite-dimensional super systems (x-part and $t_n$-part).Furthermore, we show that the obtained super systems are integrable superHamiltonian systems in supersymmetry manifold $\mathbb{R}^{4N+2|2N+2}$.

The Bargmann symmetry constraint and binary nonlinearization of the  super Dirac systems

  An explicit Bargmann symmetry constraint is computed and its associatedbinary nonlinearization of Lax pairs is carried out for the super Diracsystems. Under the obtained symmetry constraint, the n-th flow of the superDirac hierarchy is decomposed into two super finite-dimensional integrableHamiltonian systems, defined over the supersymmetry manifold $R^{4N|2N}$ withthe corresponding dynamical variables $x$ and $t_n$. The integrals of motionrequired for Liouville integrability are explicitly given.

Type II Nodal line Semimetal

  Recently, topological semimetals become hot topic in condensed matterphysics, including Dirac semimetal, Weyl semimetal, and nodal line semimetal(NLSM). In this paper, a new type of node- line semimetal - type-II NLSM isproposed based on a two-band cubic lattice model. For type-II NLSM, the zeroenergy bulk states have a closed loop in momentum space but the (local) Weylcones on nodal line become tilted. The effect of magnetic field and that ofcorrelation on type-II NLSM are studied. In particular, after consideringrepulsive interaction and additional spin degrees of freedom, different typesof long range magnetic orders appear in bulk states. In addition, theinteraction-induced ferromagnetic order of surface states may exist. Atcritical point between type-I NLSM and type-II NLSM, arbitrary tiny interactioninduces ferromagnetic order due to a flat band at Fermi surface.

Personalized Next Point-of-Interest Recommendation via Latent Behavior  Patterns Inference

  In this paper, we address the problem of personalized next Point-of-interest(POI) recommendation which has become an important and very challenging taskfor location-based social networks (LBSNs), but not well studied yet. With theconjecture that, under different contextual scenarios, human exhibits distinctmobility pattern, we attempt here to jointly model the next POI recommendationunder the influence of user's latent behavior pattern. We propose to adopt athird-rank tensor to model the successive check-in behaviors. By integratingcategorical influence into mobility patterns and aggregating user's spatialpreference on a POI, the proposed model deal with the next new POIrecommendation problem by nature. By incorporating softmax function to fuse thepersonalized Markov chain with latent pattern, we furnish a BayesianPersonalized Ranking (BPR) approach and derive the optimization criterionaccordingly. Expectation Maximization (EM) is then used to estimate the modelparameters. We further develop a personalized model by taking into accountpersonalized mobility patterns under the contextual scenario to improve therecommendation performance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale LBSNsdatasets demonstrate the significant improvements of our model over severalstate-of-the-art methods.

Late-time evolution of charged massive Dirac fields in the Kerr-Newman  background

  We investigate both the intermediate late-time tail and the asymptotic tailbehavior of the charged massive Dirac fields in the background of theKerr-Newman black hole. We find that the intermediate late-time behavior ofcharged massive Dirac fields is dominated by an inverse power-law decaying tailwithout any oscillation, which is different from the oscillatory decaying tailsof the scalar field. We note that the dumping exponent depends not only on theangular quantum numbers $m$, the separation constant $\lambda$ and the rotatingparameter $a$, but also on the product $seQ$ of the spin weight of the Diracfield and the charges of the black hole and the fields. We also find that thedecay rate of the asymptotically late-time tail is $t^{-5/6}$, and theoscillation of the tail has the period of $2\pi / \mu$ which is modulated bytwo types of long-term phase shifts.

Supersymmetric Unparticle Effects on Higgs Boson Mass and Dark Matter

  We propose a model that introduces a supersymmetric unparticle operator inthe minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. We analyze the lowest dimensionoperator involving an unparticle. This operator behaves as a Standard Modelgauge singlet and it introduces a new parameter into the Higgs potential whichcan provide an alternative way to relax the upper limit on the lightest Higgsboson mass. This operator also introduces several unparticle interactions whichcan induce a neutral Higgsino to decay into a spinor unparticle. It alsoinduces violation of scale invariance around the electroweak scale. It isnecessary for the scale of this violation to be larger than the lightestsupersymmetric particle mass to maintain the latter as the usual weaklyinteracting massive particle dark matter candidate. An alternative is to haveunparticle state as dark matter candidate. We also comment on some colliderimplications.

Multi- Physics analysis of the RFQ for the Injector Scheme II of CADS  Driver Linac

  A 162.5 MHz, 2.1 MeV Radio Frequency Quadruples (RFQ) structure is beingdesigned for the Injector Scheme II of China Accelerator Driver System (CADS)driver linac. The RFQ will operate at continuous wave (CW) mode as required.For the CW normal conducting machine, the heat management will be one of themost important issues, since the temperature fluctuation may cause cavitydeformation and leading to the resonant frequency shift. Therefor a detailedmulti-physics analysis is necessary to ensure that the cavity can be stablyworked at the required power level. The multi-physics analysis process includesRF Electromagnetic analysis, Thermal analysis, Mechnical analysis, and thisprocess will be iterated for several cycles until the satisfied solution can befound. As one of the widely accepted measures, the cooling water system is usedfor frequency fine tunning, so the tunning capability of the cooling watersystem is also studied at different conditions. The results indicate that withthe cooling water system, both the temperature rise and the frequency shift canbe controlled in an acceptable level.

The Simulation of Non-Abelian Statistics of Majorana Fermions in Ising  Chain with Z2 Symmetry

  In this paper, we numerically study the non-Abelian statistics of thezero-energy Majorana fermions on the end of Majorana chain and show itsapplication to quantum computing by mapping it to a spin model with specialsymmetry. In particular, by using transverse-field Ising model with Z2symmetry, we verify the nontrivial non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions.Numerical evidence and comparison in both Majorana-representation andspin-representation are presented. The degenerate ground states of a symmetryprotected spin chain therefore previde a promising platform for topologicalquantum computation.

Differential flow correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions

  A systematic analysis of correlations between different orders of$p_T$-differential flow is presented, including mode coupling effects in flowvectors, correlations between flow angles (a.k.a. event-plane correlations),and correlations between flow magnitudes, all of which were previously studiedwith integrated flows. We find that the mode coupling effects amongdifferential flows largely mirror those among the corresponding integratedflows, except at small transverse momenta where mode coupling contributions aresmall. For the fourth- and fifth-order flow vectors $V_4$ and $V_5$ we arguethat the event plane correlations can be understood as the ratio between themode coupling contributions to these flows and and the flow magnitudes. We alsofind that for $V_4$ and $V_5$ the linear response contribution scales linearlywith the corresponding cumulant-defined eccentricities but not with thestandard eccentricities.

Thermodynamical stability for perfect fluid

  According to maximum entropy principle, it has been proved that thegravitational field equations could be derived by the extrema of total entropyfor perfect fluid, which implies that thermodynamic relations containinformation of gravity. In this manuscript, we obtain a criterion forthermodynamical stability of an adiabatic, self-gravitating perfect fluidsystem by the second variation of total entropy. We show, for Einstein'sgravity with spherical symmetry spacetime, that the criterion is consistentwith that for dynamical stability derived by Chandrasekhar and Wald. We alsofind that the criterion could be applied to cases without spherical symmetry,or under general perturbations. The result further establishes the connectionbetween thermodynamics and gravity.

Consistency between dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities for  perfect fluid in $f(R)$ theories

  We investigate the stability criterions for perfect fluid in $f(R)$ theorieswhich is an important generalization of general relativity. Firstly, usingWald's general variation principle, we recast Seifert's work and obtain thedynamical stability criterion. Then using our generalized thermodynamicalcriterion, we obtain the concrete expressions of the criterion. We show thatthe dynamical stability criterion is exactly the same as the thermodynamicalstability criterion. This result suggests that there is an inherent connectionbetween the thermodynamics and gravity in $f(R)$ theories. It should be pointedout that using the thermodynamical method to determine the stability forperfect fluid is simpler and more directly than the dynamical method.

Nanoscale Bandgap Tuning across an Inhomogeneous Ferroelectric Interface

  We report nanoscale bandgap engineering via a local strain across theinhomogeneous ferroelectric interface, which is controlled by thevisible-light-excited probe voltage. Switchable photovolatic effects and thespectral response of the photocurrent were explore to illustrate the reversiblebandgap variation (~0.3eV). This local-strain-engineered bandgap has beenfurther revealed by in situ probe-voltage-assisted valence electron energy-lossspectroscopy (EELS). Phase-field simulations and first-principle calculationswere also employed for illustration of the large local strain and the bandgapvariation in ferroelectric perovskite oxides. This reversible bandgap tuning incomplex oxides demonstrates a framework for the understanding of theopticallyrelated behaviors (photovoltaic, photoemission, and photocatalysteffects) affected by order parameters such as charge, orbital, and latticeparameters.

Progressive Color Transfer with Dense Semantic Correspondences

  We propose a new algorithm for color transfer between images that haveperceptually similar semantic structures. We aim to achieve a more accuratecolor transfer that leverages semantically-meaningful dense correspondencebetween images. To accomplish this, our algorithm uses neural representationsfor matching. Additionally, the color transfer should be spatially variant andglobally coherent. Therefore, our algorithm optimizes a local linear model forcolor transfer satisfying both local and global constraints. Our proposedapproach jointly optimizes matching and color transfer, adopting acoarse-to-fine strategy. The proposed method can be successfully extended fromone-to-one to one-to-many color transfer. The latter further addresses theproblem of mismatching elements of the input image. We validate our proposedmethod by testing it on a large variety of image content.

Protein Dynamical Transition in Terahertz Dielectric Response

  The 200 K protein dynamical transition is observed for the first time in theteraherz dielectric response. The complex dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$ =$\epsilon$' + i$\epsilon$" is determined in the 0.2 - 2.0 THz and 80-294 Kranges. $\epsilon$" has a linear temperature dependence up to 200 K thensharply increases. The low temperature linear dependence in $\epsilon$"indicates anharmonicity for temperatures 80 K < T < 180 K, challenging theassumed harmonicity below 200K. The temperature dependence is consistent withbeta relaxation response and shows the protein motions involved in thedynamical transition extend to subpicosecond time scales.

Theoretical study of subwavelength imaging by acoustic metamaterial  slabs

  We investigate theoretically subwavelength imaging by acoustic metamaterialslabs immersed in the liquid matrix. A near-field subwavelength image formed byevanescent waves is achieved by a designed metamaterial slab with negative massdensity and positive modulus. A subwavelength real image is achieved by adesigned metamaterial slab with simultaneously negative mass density andmodulus. These results are expected to shed some lights on designing noveldevices of acoustic metamaterials.

Quantum spin liquid with fermionized pi-vortices

  In this paper, we study the non-magnetic insulator state near Mott transitionof 2D pi-flux Hubbard model on square lattice and find that such non-magneticinsulator state is quantum spin liquid state with nodal fermionic excitations -nodal spin liquid (NSL). When there exists small easy-plane anisotropic energy,the ground state becomes Z2 topological spin liquid (TSL) with full gappedexcitations. The U(1)times U(1) mutual--Chern-Simons (MCS) theory is obtainedto describe the low energy physics of NSL and TSL.

Chiral Spin Liquid in Correlated Topological Insulator

  In this paper, we investigate the topological Hubbard model - the spinfulHaldane model with on-site interaction on honeycomb lattice with spin rotationsymmetry by using slave-rotor approach and find that chiral spin liquid existsin such a correlated electron system of the intermediate coupling region. Byconsidering the anyon nature of excitations, chiral spin liquid may be theground state of the topological Hubbard model. The low energy physics isbasically determined by its Chern-Simons gauge theory.

Topological Superfluid in P-band Optical Lattice

  In this paper by studying p-band fermionic system with nearest neighborattractive interaction we find translation symmetry protected Z2 topologicalsuperfluid (TSF) that is characterized by a special fermion parity pattern athigh symmetry points in momentum space k=(0,0), (0,pi), (pi,0), (pi,pi). SuchZ2 TSF supports the robust Majorana edge modes and a new type of low energyexcitation - (supersymmetric) Z2 link-excitation. In the end we address apossible realization of such interacting p-band fermions with Z2 TSF.

Composite Spin Liquid in Correlated Topological Insulator - Spin Liquid  without Spin-Charge Separation

  In this paper, we found a new type of insulator - composite spin liquid whichcan be regarded as a short range B-type topological spin-density-wave.Composite spin liquid is topological ordered state beyond the classification oftraditional spin liquid states. The elementary excitations are the "compositeelectrons" with both spin degree of freedom and charge degree of freedom,together with topological spin texture. This topological state supports chiraledge mode but no topological degeneracy.

Ferromagnetism and Antiferromagnetism of Correlated Topological  Insulator with Flat Band

  In this paper, based on the mean field approach andrandom-phase-approximation, we study the magnetic properties of the spinfulHaldane model on honeycomb lattice of topological flat band with on-siterepulsive Coulomb interaction. We find that the antiferromagnetic (AF) order ismore stable than ferromagnetic (FM) order at (or near) half-filling; while awayfrom half-filling the phase diagram becomes complex: At large doping, FM orderis more stable than AF order due to the flatness of band structure. Inparticular, we find that at quarter filling case, the system becomes a Q=1$topological insulator which is induced by the FM order.

Topological Majorana Lattice Model: Induced "Topological Superconductor"  on Topological Superconductor with Vortex-lattice

  In this paper we study an s-wave topological SC with a square vortex-lattice.We proposed a topological Majorana lattice model to describe this topologicalstate. We found that the Majorana lattice model is really a "topological SC" onthe parent topological SC. Such correspondence between the Majorana latticemodel and the topological SC with vortex-lattice is another holographic featureof the topological state. In addition, the numerical calculations confirm ourtheoretical prediction.

Topological Superconductors in Correlated Chern Insulators

  In this paper, we realize a topological superconductor (TSC) in correlatedtopological insulator - the interacting spinful Haldane model. We consider theelectrons on the Haldane model with on-site negative-U interaction and thenstudy its properties by mean field theory and random-phase-approximation (RPA)approach. We found that in the intermediate interaction region, the groundstate becomes a TSC with the Chern number 2. We also study its edge states andthe zero modes of the pi-flux.

Magnetic Orders of Correlated Topological Insulators at Finite  Temperature

  In this paper, we study the magnetic orders of two dimensional correlatedtopological insulators including the correlated Chern insulator and thecorrelated Z2 topological insulator at finite temperature. For the 2Dcorrelated Chern insulator, we found that thermal-fluctuation-induced magneticorder appears in the intermediate interaction region of the correlated Cherninsulator. On the contrary, for the correlated Z2 topological insulator theredoesn't exist the thermal-fluctuation-induced magnetic order. In the end, wegive an explanation on the difference.

Topological Mid-gap States of Topological Insulators with  Flux-Superlattice

  In this paper based on the Haldane model, we study the topological insulatorwith superlattice of pi-fluxes. We find that there exist the mid-gap statesinduced by the flux-superlattice. In particular, the mid-gap states havenontrivial topological properties, including the nonzero Chern number and thegapless edge states. We derive an effective tight-binding model to describe thetopological midgap states and then study the mid-gap states by the effectivetight-binding model. The results can be straightforwardly generalized to othertwo dimensional topological insulators with flux-superlattice.

Theory of Vacancy-Induced Intrinsic Magnetic Impurity with  Quasi-Localized Spin Moment in Graphene

  In this paper, by considering the Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice, wedeveloped a theory for the intrinsic magnetic impurities (MIs) with thequasi-localized spin moments induced by the vacancies in graphene. Because theintrinsic MIs are characterized by the zero modes that are rthotropic to theitinerant electrons, their properties are much different from those of AndersonMIs with the well-localized spin moments.

Interferometric characterization of pulse front tilt of spatiotemporally  focused femtosecond laser pulses for three-dimensional micromachining  application

  We report on an experimental measurement of the pulse front tilt (PFT) ofspatiotemporally focused femtosecond laser pulses in the focal plane in bothair and bulk transparent materials, which is achieved by examination of theinterference pattern between the spatiotemporally focused pulse and aconventional focused reference pulse as a function of time delay between thetwo pulses. Our simulation results agree well with the experimentalobservations.

Verifying Non-Abelian Statistics by Numerical Braiding Majorana Fermions

  Recently, Majorana fermions (MFs) have attracted intensive attention becauseof their possible non-Abelian statistics. This paper points out an approach toverify the non-Abelian statistics of MFs in topological superconductors. Weintroduce a single particle representation of braiding operators that obeyanti-commutating relation of Bogolubov-de Gennes (BdG) states. From therelationship between the braiding operator of MFs and that of BdG states, weverify non-Abelian statistics of MFs in 1D and 2D topological SCs.

Effects of Attractive correlation on Topological Flat-bands Model

  In this paper, we study the effects of attractive correlation on thetopological insulator ($TI$) with topological flat-bands using an extendedattractive Kane-Mele-Hubbard model (KMHM). In the KMHM, we found a quantumphase transition from $TI$ to the superconductor ($SC$) state upon theincreasing of the attractive Hubbard interaction $U$ at the mean field level.This type of $SC$ phase transition is different from the traditional $SC$ phasetransition which develops from the gapless Fermi Liquid. Cooperon-type gappedexcitations exist in the $TI$ side near this type of $SC$ phase transition.

Classification of Majorana Fermions in Two-Dimensional Topological  Superconductors

  Recently, Majorana Fermions (MFs) have attracted intensive attention due totheir exotic statistics and possible applications in topological quantumcomputation (TQC). They are proposed to exist in various two-dimensional (2D)topological systems, such as px+ipy topological superconductor andnanowire-superconducting hybridization system. In this paper, two types ofMajorana Fermions with different polygon sign rules are pointed out. A "smokinggun" numerical evidence to identify MF's classification is presented throughlooking for the signature of a first order topological quantum phasetransition. By using it, several 2D topological superconductors are studied.

Topological Hierarchy Insulators and Topological Fractal Insulators

  Topological insulators are new states of quantum matter with metallicedge/surface states. In this paper, we pointed out that there exists a new typeof particle-hole symmetry-protected topological insulator - topologicalhierarchy insulator (THI), a composite topological state of a (parent)topological insulator and its defect-induced topological mid-gap states. Aparticular type of THI is topological fractal insulator, that is a THI withself-similar topological structure. In the end, we discuss the possibleexperimental realizations of THIs.

On the Cauchy Problem of 3D Nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes Equations with  Density-Dependent Viscosity and Vacuum

  We consider the global existence and large-time asymptotic behavior of strongsolutions to the Cauchy problem of the three-dimensional nonhomogeneousincompressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity andvacuum. We establish some key a priori exponential decay-in-time rates of thestrong solutions. Then after using these estimates, we also obtain the globalexistence of strong solutions in the whole three-dimensional space, providedthat the initial velocity is suitably small in the $\dot H^\beta$-norm for some$\beta\in(1/2,1].$ Note that this result is proved without any smallnessconditions on the initial density. Moreover, the density can contain vacuumstates and even have compact support initially.

Chiral Majorana edge state in a quantum anomalous Hall  insulator-superconductor structure

  After the recognition of the possibility to implement Majorana fermions usingthe building blocks of solid-state matters, the detection of this peculiarparticle has been an intense focus of research. Here we experimentallydemonstrate a collection of Majorana fermions living in a one-dimensionaltransport channel at the boundary of a superconducting quantum anomalous Hallinsulator thin film. A series of topological phase changes are controlled bythe reversal of the magnetization, where a half-integer quantized conductanceplateau (0.5e2/h) is observed as a clear signature of the Majorana phase. Thistransport signature can be well repeated during many magnetic reversal sweeps,and can be tracked at different temperatures, providing a promising evidence ofthe chiral Majorana edge modes in the system.

CD-CNN: A Partially Supervised Cross-Domain Deep Learning Model for  Urban Resident Recognition

  Driven by the wave of urbanization in recent decades, the research topicabout migrant behavior analysis draws great attention from both academia andthe government. Nevertheless, subject to the cost of data collection and thelack of modeling methods, most of existing studies use only questionnairesurveys with sparse samples and non-individual level statistical data toachieve coarse-grained studies of migrant behaviors. In this paper, a partiallysupervised cross-domain deep learning model named CD-CNN is proposed formigrant/native recognition using mobile phone signaling data as behavioralfeatures and questionnaire survey data as incomplete labels. Specifically,CD-CNN features in decomposing the mobile data into location domain andcommunication domain, and adopts a joint learning framework that combines twoconvolutional neural networks with a feature balancing scheme. Moreover, CD-CNNemploys a three-step algorithm for training, in which the co-training step isof great value to partially supervised cross-domain learning. Comparativeexperiments on the city Wuxi demonstrate the high predictive power of CD-CNN.Two interesting applications further highlight the ability of CD-CNN forin-depth migrant behavioral analysis.

Spontaneous CP Violating Phase as The CKM Matrix Phase

  We propose that the CP violating phase in the CKM mixing matrix is identicalto the CP phases responsible for the spontaneous CP violation in the Higgspotential. A specific multi-Higgs model with Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry isconstructed to realize this idea. The CP violating phase does not vanish whenall Higgs masses become large. There are flavor changing neutral current (FCNC)interactions mediated by neutral Higgs bosons at the tree level. However,unlike general multi-Higgs models, the FCNC Yukawa couplings are fixed in termsof the quark masses and CKM mixing angles. Implications for meson-anti-mesonmixing, including recent data on $D-\bar D$ mixing, and neutron electric dipolemoment (EDM) are studied. We find that the neutral Higgs boson masses can be atthe order of one hundred GeV. The neutron EDM can be close to the presentexperimental upper bound.

A Novel Symmetry Constraint Of The Super cKdV System

  A new (1+1)-dimensional integrable system, i. e. the super coupledKorteweg-de Vries (cKdV) system, has been constructed by a super extension ofthe well-known (1+1)-dimensional cKdV system. For this new system, a novelsymmetry constraint between the potential and eigenfunction can be obtained bymeans of the binary nonlinearization of its Lax pairs. The constraints for evenvariables are explicit and the constraints for odd variables are implicit.Under the symmetry constraint, the spacial part and the temporal parts of theequations associated with the Lax pairs for the super cKdV system can bedecomposed into the super finite-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems onthe supersymmetry manifold $R^{4N|2N+2}$, whose integrals of motion areexplicitly given.

Empirical Likelihood for Right Censored Lifetime Data

  This paper considers the empirical likelihood (EL) construction of confidenceintervals for a linear functional based on right censored lifetime data. Manyof the results in literature show that log EL has a limiting scaled chi-squaredistribution, where the scale parameter is a function of the unknown asymptoticvariance. The scale parameter has to be estimated for the construction.Additional estimation would reduce the coverage accuracy for the parameter.This diminishes a main advantage of the EL method for censored data. Byutilizing certain influence functions in an estimating equation, it is shownthat under very general conditions, log EL converges weakly to a standardchi-square distribution and thereby eliminates the need for estimating thescale parameter. Moreover, a special way of employing influence functions easesthe otherwise very demanding computations of the EL method. Our approach yieldssmaller asymptotic variance of the influence function than those comparableones considered by Wang and Jing (2001) and Qin and Zhao (2007). Thus it is notsurprising that confidence intervals using influence functions give a bettercoverage accuracy as demonstrated by simulations.

Gravitational Interaction of Higgs Boson and Weak Boson Scattering

  With the LHC discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs-like boson, we study gravitationalinteraction of the Higgs boson via the unique dimension-4 operator involvingHiggs doublet and scalar curvature, $\,\xi H^\dag H R\,$, with nonminimalcoupling $\,\xi\,$. This Higgs portal term can be transformed away in Einsteinframe and induces gauge-invariant effective interactions in the Higgs sector.We study the weak boson scattering in Einstein frame, and explicitlydemonstrate the longitudinal-Goldstone boson equivalence theorem in thepresence of $\,\xi\,$ coupling. With these, we derive unitarity bound on theHiggs gravitational coupling $\,\xi\,$ in Einstein frame, which is strongerthan that inferred from the current LHC Higgs measurements. We further study$\xi$-dependent weak boson scattering cross sections at TeV scale, and proposea new LHC probe of the Higgs-gravity coupling $\,\xi\,$ via weak bosonscattering experiments.

Revisiting the matter power spectra in $f(R)$ gravity

  In this paper, we study the non-linear matter power spectrum in a specificfamily of $f(R)$ models that can reproduce the $\Lambda$CDM backgroundexpansion history, using high resolution $N$-body simulations based on the {\scecosmog} code. We measure the matter power spectrum in the range of $0.05h{\rmMpc}^{-1}<k<10h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ from simulations for our $f(R)$ models and givetheoretical explanations to their behaviour and evolution patterns. We alsoexamine the chameleon mechanism for our models and find that it worksthroughout the cosmic history in dense regions, for our $f(R)$ models with$|f_{R0}|<10^{-4}$. On the other hand, for models with $|f_{R0}|>10^{-3}$, wefind no chameleon screening in dense regions at late times ($z<3$), which meansthat those models could be ruled out due to the factor-of-$1/3$ enhancement tothe strength of Newtonian gravity. We also give the best-fit parameters for ageneralised PPF fitting formula which works well for the models studied here.

Natural Electroweak Symmetry Breaking from Scale Invariant Higgs  Mechanism

  We construct a minimal viable extension of the standard model (SM) withclassical scale symmetry. Its scalar sector contains a complex singlet inaddition to the SM Higgs doublet. The scale-invariant and CP-symmetric Higgspotential generates radiative electroweak symmetry breaking a laColeman-Weinberg, and gives a natural solution to the hierarchy problem, freefrom fine-tuning. Besides the 125GeV SM-like Higgs particle, it predicts a newCP-even Higgs (serving as the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of scale symmetrybreaking) and a CP-odd scalar singlet (providing the dark matter candidate) atweak scale. We systematically analyze experimental constraints from direct LHCHiggs searches and electroweak precision tests, as well as theoretical boundsfrom unitarity, triviality and vacuum stability. We demonstrate the viableparameter space, and discuss implications for new Higgs and dark matter (DM)searches at the upcoming LHC runs and for the on-going direct detections of DM.

Plasmonic Crystal Cavity on Single-Mode Optical Fiber End Facet for  Label-Free Biosensing

  All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) devices on single-mode optical fibers'(SMF) end facets, as reported up to date, are limited by severely broad andshallow resonance spectra. The consequent poor performance when they are usedas refractive index sensors, together with the challenge of nanofabrication onfiber end facets, has prohibited the development of such devices for label-freebiosensing. Meanwhile, the planewave coupled, multimode fiber and fibersidewall SPR counterparts are extensively employed for label-free biosensing.In this paper, we report the design, fabrication and characterization of aplasmonic crystal cavity on a SMF end facet, which shows high performancelabel-free sensing capability that comes from a steep cavity resonance near theplasmonic bandedge. The experimental figure-of-merit is 68 RIU^-1, which isover twenty times improvement to previous reports. The refractive indexdetection limit is 3.5*10^-6 RIU at 1 s integration time. We also describe anovel glue-and-strip process to transfer gold nano structures onto fiber endfacets.

Ultra-narrow Negative Flare Front Observed in Helium-10830~Å using  the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope

  Solar flares are sudden flashes of brightness on the Sun and are oftenassociated with coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles which haveadverse effects in the near Earth environment. By definition, flares areusually referred to bright features resulting from excess emission. Using thenewly commissioned 1.6~m New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory,here we show a striking "negative" flare with a narrow, but unambiguous "dark"moving front observed in He I 10830 \AA, which is as narrow as 340 km and isassociated with distinct spectral characteristics in H-alpha and Mg II lines.Theoretically, such negative contrast in He I 10830 \AA\ can be produced underspecial circumstances, by nonthermal-electron collisions, or photoionizationfollowed by recombination. Our discovery, made possible due to unprecedentedspatial resolution, confirms the presence of the required plasma conditions andprovides unique information in understanding the energy release and radiativetransfer in astronomical objects.
