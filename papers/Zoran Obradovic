Deeply Supervised Semantic Model for Click-Through Rate Prediction in  Sponsored Search

  In sponsored search it is critical to match ads that are relevant to a queryand to accurately predict their likelihood of being clicked. Commercial searchengines typically use machine learning models for both query-ad relevancematching and click-through-rate (CTR) prediction. However, matching models arebased on the similarity between a query and an ad, ignoring the fact that aretrieved ad may not attract clicks, while click models rely on click history,being of limited use for new queries and ads. We propose a deeply supervisedarchitecture that jointly learns the semantic embeddings of a query and an adas well as their corresponding CTR.We also propose a novel cohort negativesampling technique for learning implicit negative signals. We trained theproposed architecture using one billion query-ad pairs from a major commercialweb search engine. This architecture improves the best-performing baseline deepneural architectures by 2\% of AUC for CTR prediction and by statisticallysignificant 0.5\% of NDCG for query-ad matching.

Improving confidence while predicting trends in temporal disease  networks

  For highly sensitive real-world predictive analytic applications such ashealthcare and medicine, having good prediction accuracy alone is often notenough. These kinds of applications require a decision making process whichuses uncertainty estimation as input whenever possible. Quality of uncertaintyestimation is a subject of over or under confident prediction, which is oftennot addressed in many models. In this paper we show several extensions to theGaussian Conditional Random Fields model, which aim to provide higher qualityuncertainty estimation. These extensions are applied to the temporal diseasegraph built from the State Inpatient Database (SID) of California, acquiredfrom the HCUP. Our experiments demonstrate benefits of using graph informationin modeling temporal disease properties as well as improvements in uncertaintyestimation provided by given extensions of the Gaussian Conditional RandomFields method.

Searching for Synergism Among Combinations of Drugs of Abuse and the Use  of Isobolographic Analysis

  It is well known that individuals who abuse drugs usually use more than onesubstance. Toxic consequences of single and multiple drug use are welldocumented in the Treatment Episodes Data Set that lists combinations thatresult in hospital admissions. Using this list as a guide, we focused ourattention on combinations that result in the most hospital admissions andsearched the PubMed database to determine the number of publications dealingwith these toxic combinations. Of special interest were those publications thatlooked for or used the term synergism in their titles or abstracts, a searchthat produced an extensive list of published articles. However, a furtherintersection of these with the term isobole revealed a surprisingly smallnumber of literature reports. Because the method of isoboles is the most commonquantitative method for distinguishing between drug synergism and simpleadditivity, the small number of investigations that actually employed thisquantitation suggests that the term synergism is not properly documented indescribing the toxicity among these abused substances. The possible reasons forthis lack of quantitation may be related to a misunderstanding of the modelingequations. The theory and modeling are discussed here.

Semi-supervised learning for structured regression on partially observed  attributed graphs

  Conditional probabilistic graphical models provide a powerful framework forstructured regression in spatio-temporal datasets with complex correlationpatterns. However, in real-life applications a large fraction of observationsis often missing, which can severely limit the representational power of thesemodels. In this paper we propose a Marginalized Gaussian Conditional RandomFields (m-GCRF) structured regression model for dealing with missing labels inpartially observed temporal attributed graphs. This method is aimed at learningwith both labeled and unlabeled parts and effectively predicting future valuesin a graph. The method is even capable of learning from nodes for which theresponse variable is never observed in history, which poses problems for manystate-of-the-art models that can handle missing data. The proposed model ischaracterized for various missingness mechanisms on 500 synthetic graphs. Thebenefits of the new method are also demonstrated on a challenging applicationfor predicting precipitation based on partial observations of climate variablesin a temporal graph that spans the entire continental US. We also show that themethod can be useful for optimizing the costs of data collection in climateapplications via active reduction of the number of weather stations toconsider. In experiments on these real-world and synthetic datasets we showthat the proposed model is consistently more accurate than alternativesemi-supervised structured models, as well as models that either use imputationto deal with missing values or simply ignore them altogether.

Modeling Customer Engagement from Partial Observations

  It is of high interest for a company to identify customers expected to bringthe largest profit in the upcoming period. Knowing as much as possible abouteach customer is crucial for such predictions. However, their demographic data,preferences, and other information that might be useful for building loyaltyprograms is often missing. Additionally, modeling relations among differentcustomers as a network can be beneficial for predictions at an individuallevel, as similar customers tend to have similar purchasing patterns. Weaddress this problem by proposing a robust framework for structured regressionon deficient data in evolving networks with a supervised representationlearning based on neural features embedding. The new method is compared toseveral unstructured and structured alternatives for predicting customerbehavior (e.g. purchasing frequency and customer ticket) on user networksgenerated from customer databases of two companies from different industries.The obtained results show $4\%$ to $130\%$ improvement in accuracy overalternatives when all customer information is known. Additionally, therobustness of our method is demonstrated when up to $80\%$ of demographicinformation was missing where it was up to several folds more accurate ascompared to alternatives that are either ignoring cases with missing values orlearn their feature representation in an unsupervised manner.

Deep Attention Model for Triage of Emergency Department Patients

  Optimization of patient throughput and wait time in emergency departments(ED) is an important task for hospital systems. For that reason, EmergencySeverity Index (ESI) system for patient triage was introduced to help guidemanual estimation of acuity levels, which is used by nurses to rank thepatients and organize hospital resources. However, despite improvements that itbrought to managing medical resources, such triage system greatly depends onnurse's subjective judgment and is thus prone to human errors. Here, we proposea novel deep model based on the word attention mechanism designed forpredicting a number of resources an ED patient would need. Our approachincorporates routinely available continuous and nominal (structured) data withmedical text (unstructured) data, including patient's chief complaint, pastmedical history, medication list, and nurse assessment collected for 338,500 EDvisits over three years in a large urban hospital. Using both structured andunstructured data, the proposed approach achieves the AUC of $\sim 88\%$ forthe task of identifying resource intensive patients (binary classification),and the accuracy of $\sim 44\%$ for predicting exact category of number ofresources (multi-class classification task), giving an estimated lift overnurses' performance by 16\% in accuracy. Furthermore, the attention mechanismof the proposed model provides interpretability by assigning attention scoresfor nurses' notes which is crucial for decision making and implementation ofsuch approaches in the real systems working on human health.
