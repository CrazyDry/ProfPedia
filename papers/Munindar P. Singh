Tosca: Operationalizing Commitments Over Information Protocols

  The notion of commitment is widely studied as a high-level abstraction for
modeling multiagent interaction. An important challenge is supporting flexible
decentralized enactments of commitment specifications. In this paper, we
combine recent advances on specifying commitments and information protocols.
Specifically, we contribute Tosca, a technique for automatically synthesizing
information protocols from commitment specifications. Our main result is that
the synthesized protocols support commitment alignment, which is the idea that
agents must make compatible inferences about their commitments despite
decentralization.


Violable Contracts and Governance for Blockchain Applications

  We examine blockchain technologies, especially smart contracts, as a platform
for decentralized applications. By providing a basis for consensus, blockchain
promises to upend business models that presuppose a central authority. However,
blockchain suffers from major shortcomings arising from an over-regimented way
of organizing computation that limits its prospects. We propose a
sociotechnical, yet computational, perspective that avoids those shortcomings.
A centerpiece of our vision is the notion of a declarative, violable contract
in contradistinction to smart contracts. This new way of thinking enables
flexible governance, by formalizing organizational structures; verification of
correctness without obstructing autonomy; and a meaningful basis for trust.


Interaction-Oriented Software Engineering: Concepts and Principles

  Following established tradition, software engineering today is rooted in a
conceptually centralized way of thinking. The primary SE artifact is a
specification of a machine -- a computational artifact -- that would meet the
(elicited and) stated requirements. Therein lies a fundamental mismatch with
(open) sociotechnical systems, which involve multiple autonomous social
participants or principals who interact with each other to further their
individual goals. No central machine governs the behaviors of the various
principals.
  We introduce Interaction-Oriented Software Engineering (IOSE) as an approach
expressly suited to the needs of open sociotechnical systems. In IOSE,
specifying a system amounts to specifying the interactions among the principals
as protocols. IOSE reinterprets the classical software engineering principles
of modularity, abstraction, separation of concerns, and encapsulation in a
manner that accords with the realities of sociotechnical systems. To highlight
the novelty of IOSE, we show where well-known SE methodologies, especially
those that explicitly aim to address either sociotechnical systems or the
modeling of interactions among autonomous principals, fail to satisfy the IOSE
principles.


A Probabilistic Approach for Maintaining Trust Based on Evidence

  Leading agent-based trust models address two important needs. First, they
show how an agent may estimate the trustworthiness of another agent based on
prior interactions. Second, they show how agents may share their knowledge in
order to cooperatively assess the trustworthiness of others. However, in
real-life settings, information relevant to trust is usually obtained
piecemeal, not all at once. Unfortunately, the problem of maintaining trust has
drawn little attention. Existing approaches handle trust updates in a
heuristic, not a principled, manner. This paper builds on a formal model that
considers probability and certainty as two dimensions of trust. It proposes a
mechanism using which an agent can update the amount of trust it places in
other agents on an ongoing basis. This paper shows via simulation that the
proposed approach (a) provides accurate estimates of the trustworthiness of
agents that change behavior frequently; and (b) captures the dynamic behavior
of the agents. This paper includes an evaluation based on a real dataset drawn
from Amazon Marketplace, a leading e-commerce site.


A Critical Examination of Languages for Specifying Interaction Protocols
  for Decentralized Social Machines

  Important Web applications are social machines in that they they involve
interoperation among autonomous parties through the Web. We particularly focus
on decentralized social machines that reflect the autonomy of their
participants in infrastructure that avoids a central provider or authority. A
social machine can be effectively specified via an interaction protocol that
specifies how participants engage with each other by sending and receiving
messages.
  The importance of decentralization in modern applications has driven research
into languages for specifying interaction protocols. However, despite their
shared objectives, current languages differ significantly in their -- often
complex -- technical details.
  We contribute a comparative evaluation of these languages over criteria
geared toward social machines that incorporate three crucial aspects: (i)
information, to express social meaning via instances, correlation, and
integrity; (ii) flexible enactments -- to enable autonomy via concurrency and
extensibility -- that are also causally valid; and (iii) asynchrony---to avoid
hidden coupling.
  We show how the underlying abstractions and assumptions of the various
languages fare on these criteria.


Blockchains for Business Process Management - Challenges and
  Opportunities

  Blockchain technology promises a sizable potential for executing
inter-organizational business processes without requiring a central party
serving as a single point of trust (and failure). This paper analyzes its
impact on business process management (BPM). We structure the discussion using
two BPM frameworks, namely the six BPM core capabilities and the BPM lifecycle.
This paper provides research directions for investigating the application of
blockchain technology to BPM.
