Tosca: Operationalizing Commitments Over Information Protocols

  The notion of commitment is widely studied as a high-level abstraction formodeling multiagent interaction. An important challenge is supporting flexibledecentralized enactments of commitment specifications. In this paper, wecombine recent advances on specifying commitments and information protocols.Specifically, we contribute Tosca, a technique for automatically synthesizinginformation protocols from commitment specifications. Our main result is thatthe synthesized protocols support commitment alignment, which is the idea thatagents must make compatible inferences about their commitments despitedecentralization.

Violable Contracts and Governance for Blockchain Applications

  We examine blockchain technologies, especially smart contracts, as a platformfor decentralized applications. By providing a basis for consensus, blockchainpromises to upend business models that presuppose a central authority. However,blockchain suffers from major shortcomings arising from an over-regimented wayof organizing computation that limits its prospects. We propose asociotechnical, yet computational, perspective that avoids those shortcomings.A centerpiece of our vision is the notion of a declarative, violable contractin contradistinction to smart contracts. This new way of thinking enablesflexible governance, by formalizing organizational structures; verification ofcorrectness without obstructing autonomy; and a meaningful basis for trust.

Interaction-Oriented Software Engineering: Concepts and Principles

  Following established tradition, software engineering today is rooted in aconceptually centralized way of thinking. The primary SE artifact is aspecification of a machine -- a computational artifact -- that would meet the(elicited and) stated requirements. Therein lies a fundamental mismatch with(open) sociotechnical systems, which involve multiple autonomous socialparticipants or principals who interact with each other to further theirindividual goals. No central machine governs the behaviors of the variousprincipals.  We introduce Interaction-Oriented Software Engineering (IOSE) as an approachexpressly suited to the needs of open sociotechnical systems. In IOSE,specifying a system amounts to specifying the interactions among the principalsas protocols. IOSE reinterprets the classical software engineering principlesof modularity, abstraction, separation of concerns, and encapsulation in amanner that accords with the realities of sociotechnical systems. To highlightthe novelty of IOSE, we show where well-known SE methodologies, especiallythose that explicitly aim to address either sociotechnical systems or themodeling of interactions among autonomous principals, fail to satisfy the IOSEprinciples.

A Probabilistic Approach for Maintaining Trust Based on Evidence

  Leading agent-based trust models address two important needs. First, theyshow how an agent may estimate the trustworthiness of another agent based onprior interactions. Second, they show how agents may share their knowledge inorder to cooperatively assess the trustworthiness of others. However, inreal-life settings, information relevant to trust is usually obtainedpiecemeal, not all at once. Unfortunately, the problem of maintaining trust hasdrawn little attention. Existing approaches handle trust updates in aheuristic, not a principled, manner. This paper builds on a formal model thatconsiders probability and certainty as two dimensions of trust. It proposes amechanism using which an agent can update the amount of trust it places inother agents on an ongoing basis. This paper shows via simulation that theproposed approach (a) provides accurate estimates of the trustworthiness ofagents that change behavior frequently; and (b) captures the dynamic behaviorof the agents. This paper includes an evaluation based on a real dataset drawnfrom Amazon Marketplace, a leading e-commerce site.

A Critical Examination of Languages for Specifying Interaction Protocols  for Decentralized Social Machines

  Important Web applications are social machines in that they they involveinteroperation among autonomous parties through the Web. We particularly focuson decentralized social machines that reflect the autonomy of theirparticipants in infrastructure that avoids a central provider or authority. Asocial machine can be effectively specified via an interaction protocol thatspecifies how participants engage with each other by sending and receivingmessages.  The importance of decentralization in modern applications has driven researchinto languages for specifying interaction protocols. However, despite theirshared objectives, current languages differ significantly in their -- oftencomplex -- technical details.  We contribute a comparative evaluation of these languages over criteriageared toward social machines that incorporate three crucial aspects: (i)information, to express social meaning via instances, correlation, andintegrity; (ii) flexible enactments -- to enable autonomy via concurrency andextensibility -- that are also causally valid; and (iii) asynchrony---to avoidhidden coupling.  We show how the underlying abstractions and assumptions of the variouslanguages fare on these criteria.

Blockchains for Business Process Management - Challenges and  Opportunities

  Blockchain technology promises a sizable potential for executinginter-organizational business processes without requiring a central partyserving as a single point of trust (and failure). This paper analyzes itsimpact on business process management (BPM). We structure the discussion usingtwo BPM frameworks, namely the six BPM core capabilities and the BPM lifecycle.This paper provides research directions for investigating the application ofblockchain technology to BPM.
