Synergistic Security for the Industrial Internet of Things: Integrating  Redundancy, Diversity, and Hardening

  As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIot) becomes more prevalent incritical application domains, ensuring security and resilience in the face ofcyber-attacks is becoming an issue of paramount importance. Cyber-attacksagainst critical infrastructures, for example, against smart water-distributionand transportation systems, pose serious threats to public health and safety.Owing to the severity of these threats, a variety of security techniques areavailable. However, no single technique can address the whole spectrum ofcyber-attacks that may be launched by a determined and resourceful attacker. Inlight of this, we consider a multi-pronged approach for designing secure andresilient IIoT systems, which integrates redundancy, diversity, and hardeningtechniques. We introduce a framework for quantifying cyber-security risks andoptimizing IIoT design by determining security investments in redundancy,diversity, and hardening. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, wepresent two case studies in water distribution and transportation a case studyin water-distribution systems. Our numerical evaluation shows that integratingredundancy, diversity, and hardening can lead to reduced security risk at thesame cost.

VeriSolid: Correct-by-Design Smart Contracts for Ethereum

  The adoption of blockchain based distributed ledgers is growing fast due totheir ability to provide reliability, integrity, and auditability withouttrusted entities. One of the key capabilities of these emerging platforms isthe ability to create self-enforcing smart contracts. However, the developmentof smart contracts has proven to be error-prone in practice, and as a result,contracts deployed on public platforms are often riddled with securityvulnerabilities. This issue is exacerbated by the design of these platforms,which forbids updating contract code and rolling back malicious transactions.In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that a smart contract is securebefore deploying it and trusting it with significant amounts of cryptocurrency.To this end, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verificationof contracts that are specified using a transition-system based model withrigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers toreason about and verify contract behavior at a high level of abstraction.VeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code from the verified models,which enables the correct-by-design development of smart contracts.

Detection and Mitigation of Attacks on Transportation Networks as a  Multi-Stage Security Game

  In recent years, state-of-the-art traffic-control devices have evolved fromstandalone hardware to networked smart devices. Smart traffic control enablesoperators to decrease traffic congestion and environmental impact by acquiringreal-time traffic data and changing traffic signals from fixed to adaptiveschedules. However, these capabilities have inadvertently exposed trafficcontrol to a wide range of cyber-attacks, which adversaries can easily mountthrough wireless networks or even through the Internet. Indeed, recent studieshave found that a large number of traffic signals that are deployed in practicesuffer from exploitable vulnerabilities, which adversaries may use to takecontrol of the devices. Thanks to hardware-based failsafes, adversaries cannotcause traffic accidents directly by setting compromised signals to dangerousconfigurations. Nonetheless, an adversary could cause disastrous trafficcongestion by changing the schedule of compromised traffic signals, therebyeffectively crippling the transportation network. To provide theoreticalfoundations for the protection of transportation networks from these attacks,we introduce a game-theoretic model of launching, detecting, and mitigatingattacks that tamper with traffic-signal schedules. We show that finding optimalstrategies is a computationally challenging problem, and we propose efficientheuristic algorithms for finding near optimal strategies. We also introduce aGaussian-process based anomaly detector, which can alert operators to ongoingattacks. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms and the proposed detector usingnumerical experiments based on the SUMO traffic simulator.

Optimal Detection of Faulty Traffic Sensors Used in Route Planning

  In a smart city, real-time traffic sensors may be deployed for variousapplications, such as route planning. Unfortunately, sensors are prone tofailures, which result in erroneous traffic data. Erroneous data can adverselyaffect applications such as route planning, and can cause increased traveltime. To minimize the impact of sensor failures, we must detect them promptlyand accurately. However, typical detection algorithms may lead to a largenumber of false positives (i.e., false alarms) and false negatives (i.e.,missed detections), which can result in suboptimal route planning. In thispaper, we devise an effective detector for identifying faulty traffic sensorsusing a prediction model based on Gaussian Processes. Further, we present anapproach for computing the optimal parameters of the detector which minimizelosses due to false-positive and false-negative errors. We also characterizecritical sensors, whose failure can have high impact on the route planningapplication. Finally, we implement our method and evaluate it numerically usinga real-world dataset and the route planning platform OpenTripPlanner.

On the Economics of Ransomware

  While recognized as a theoretical and practical concept for over 20 years,only now ransomware has taken centerstage as one of the most prevalentcybercrimes. Various reports demonstrate the enormous burden placed oncompanies, which have to grapple with the ongoing attack waves. At the sametime, our strategic understanding of the threat and the adversarial interactionbetween organizations and cybercriminals perpetrating ransomware attacks islacking.  In this paper, we develop, to the best of our knowledge, the firstgame-theoretic model of the ransomware ecosystem. Our model captures amulti-stage scenario involving organizations from different industry sectorsfacing a sophisticated ransomware attacker. We place particular emphasis on thedecision of companies to invest in backup technologies as part of a contingencyplan, and the economic incentives to pay a ransom if impacted by an attack. Wefurther study to which degree comprehensive industry-wide backup investmentscan serve as a deterrent for ongoing attacks.

Privacy-Preserving Platform for Transactive Energy Systems

  Transactive energy systems (TES) are emerging as a transformative solutionfor the problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase inthe use of distributed energy resources and a rapid acceleration in renewableenergy generation. These, on one hand, pose a decentralized power systemcontrols problem, requiring strategic microgrid control to maintain stabilityfor the community and for the utility. On the other hand, they require robustfinancial markets operating on distributed software platforms that preserveprivacy. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a novel,blockchain-based transactive energy system. We outline the key requirements andmotivation of this platform, describe the lessons learned, and provide adescription of key architectural components of this system.

On the Design of Communication and Transaction Anonymity in  Blockchain-Based Transactive Microgrids

  Transactive microgrids are emerging as a transformative solution for theproblems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in the useof distributed energy resources and a rapid acceleration in renewable energygeneration, such as wind and solar power. Distributed ledgers have recentlyfound widespread interest in this domain due to their ability to providetransactional integrity across decentralized computing nodes. However, theexisting state of the art has not focused on the privacy preservationrequirement of these energy systems -- the transaction level data can providemuch greater insights into a prosumer's behavior compared to smart meter data.There are specific safety requirements in transactive microgrids to ensure thestability of the grid and to control the load. To fulfil these requirements,the distribution system operator needs transaction information from the grid,which poses a further challenge to the privacy-goals. This problem is madeworse by requirement for off-blockchain communication in these networks. Inthis paper, we extend a recently developed trading workflow called PETra anddescribe our solution for communication and transactional anonymity.

PlaTIBART: a Platform for Transactive IoT Blockchain Applications with  Repeatable Testing

  With the advent of blockchain-enabled IoT applications, there is an increasedneed for related software patterns, middleware concepts, and testing practicesto ensure adequate quality and productivity. IoT and blockchain each providedifferent design goals, concepts, and practices that must be integrated,including the distributed actor model and fault tolerance from IoT andtransactive information integrity over untrustworthy sources from blockchain.Both IoT and blockchain are emerging technologies and both lack codifiedpatterns and practices for development of applications when combined. Thispaper describes PlaTIBART, which is a platform for transactive IoT blockchainapplications with repeatable testing that combines the Actor pattern (which isa commonly used model of computation in IoT) together with a custom DomainSpecific Language (DSL) and test network management tools. We show howPlaTIBART has been applied to develop, test, and analyze fault-tolerant IoTblockchain applications.

Providing Privacy, Safety, and Security in IoT-Based Transactive Energy  Systems using Distributed Ledgers

  Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewableenergy resources and improvements in battery technology. While these changesenhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant managementchallenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle thesechallenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging,which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within atransactive microgrid, "prosumers" (i.e., consumers with energy generation andstorage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing theload on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to providesecurity, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system.On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from theirtrade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must beprotected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize theentire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions(PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids thatenables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETrabuilds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity forcommunication, bidding, and trading.

Designing Secure Ethereum Smart Contracts: A Finite State Machine Based  Approach

  The adoption of blockchain-based distributed computation platforms is growingfast. Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support forimplementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel applicationsin a broad range of areas, including finance and Internet-of-Things. However, asignificant number of smart contracts deployed in practice suffer from securityvulnerabilities, which enable malicious users to steal assets from a contractor to cause damage. Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts mayhandle financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs arenon-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart contracts,we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous semantics for designingcon- tracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We present a tool for creating FSMon an easy-to-use graphical interface and for automatically generating Ethereumcontracts. Further, we introduce a set of design patterns, which we implementas plugins that developers can easily add to their contracts to enhancesecurity and functionality.

Tool Demonstration: FSolidM for Designing Secure Ethereum Smart  Contracts

  Blockchain-based distributed computing platforms enable the trusted executionof computation - defined in the form of smart contracts - without trustedagents. Smart contracts are envisioned to have a variety of applications,ranging from financial to IoT asset tracking. Unfortunately, the development ofsmart contracts has proven to be extremely error prone. In practice, contractsare riddled with security vulnerabilities comprising a critical issue sincebugs are by design non-fixable and contracts may handle financial assets ofsignificant value. To facilitate the development of secure smart contracts, wehave created the FSolidM framework, which allows developers to define contractsas finite state machines (FSMs) with rigorous and clear semantics. FSolidMprovides an easy-to-use graphical editor for specifying FSMs, a code generatorfor creating Ethereum smart contracts, and a set of plugins that developers mayadd to their FSMs to enhance security and functionality.

SolidWorx: A Resilient and Trustworthy Transactive Platform for Smart  and Connected Communities

  Internet of Things and data sciences are fueling the development ofinnovative solutions for various applications in Smart and ConnectedCommunities (SCC). These applications provide participants with the capabilityto exchange not only data but also resources, which raises the concerns ofintegrity, trust, and above all the need for fair and optimal solutions to theproblem of resource allocation. This exchange of information and resourcesleads to a problem where the stakeholders of the system may have limited trustin each other. Thus, collaboratively reaching consensus on when, how, and whoshould access certain resources becomes problematic. This paper presentsSolidWorx, a blockchain-based platform that provides key mechanisms requiredfor arbitrating resource consumption across different SCC applications in adomain-agnostic manner. For example, it introduces and implements ahybrid-solver pattern, where complex optimization computation is handledoff-blockchain while solution validation is performed by a smart contract. Toensure correctness, the smart contract of SolidWorx is generated and verified.

Game-Theoretic Model of Incentivizing Privacy-Aware Users to Consent to  Location Tracking

  Nowadays, mobile users have a vast number of applications and services attheir disposal. Each of these might impose some privacy threats on users'"Personally Identifiable Information" (PII). Location privacy is a crucial partof PII, and as such, privacy-aware users wish to maximize it. This privacy canbe, for instance, threatened by a company, which collects users' traces andshares them with third parties. To maximize their location privacy, users candecide to get offline so that the company cannot localize their devices. Thelonger a user stays connected to a network, the more services he might receive,but his location privacy decreases. In this paper, we analyze the trade-offbetween location privacy, the level of services that a user experiences, andthe profit of the company. To this end, we formulate a Stackelberg Bayesiangame between the User (follower) and the Company (leader). We presenttheoretical results characterizing the equilibria of the game. To the best ofour knowledge, our work is the first to model the economically rationaldecision-making of the service provider (i.e., the Company) in conjunction withthe rational decision-making of users who wish to protect their locationprivacy. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we have used real-datafrom a testbed, and we have also shown that the game-theoretic strategy of theCompany outperforms non-strategic methods. Finally, we have considereddifferent User privacy types, and have determined the service level thatincentivizes the User to stay connected as long as possible.

Scheduling Resource-Bounded Monitoring Devices for Event Detection and  Isolation in Networks

  In networked systems, monitoring devices such as sensors are typicallydeployed to monitor various target locations. Targets are the points in thephysical space at which events of some interest, such as random faults orattacks, can occur. Most often, these devices have limited energy supplies, andthey can operate for a limited duration. As a result, energy-efficientmonitoring of various target locations through a set of monitoring devices withlimited energy supplies is a crucial problem in networked systems. In thispaper, we study optimal scheduling of monitoring devices to maximize networkcoverage for detecting and isolating events on targets for a given networklifetime. The monitoring devices considered could remain active only for afraction of the overall network lifetime. We formulate the problem ofscheduling of monitoring devices as a graph labeling problem, which unlikeother existing solutions, allows us to directly utilize the underlying networkstructure to explore the trade-off between coverage and network lifetime. Inthis direction, first we propose a greedy heuristic to solve the graph labelingproblem, and then provide a game-theoretic solution to achieve near optimalgraph labeling. Moreover, the proposed setup can be used to simultaneouslysolve the scheduling and placement of monitoring devices, which yields improvedperformance as compared to separately solving the placement and schedulingproblems. Finally, we illustrate our results on various networks, includingreal-world water distribution networks.

An Economic Study of the Effect of Android Platform Fragmentation on  Security Updates

  Vendors in the Android ecosystem typically customize their devices bymodifying Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code, adding in-house developedproprietary software, and pre-installing third-party applications. However,research has documented how various security problems are associated with thiscustomization process.  We develop a model of the Android ecosystem utilizing the concepts of gametheory and product differentiation to capture the competition involving twovendors customizing the AOSP platform. We show how the vendors are incentivizedto differentiate their products from AOSP and from each other, and how pricesare shaped through this differentiation process. We also consider two types ofconsumers: security-conscious consumers who understand and care about security,and na\"ive consumers who lack the ability to correctly evaluate securityproperties of vendor-supplied Android products or simply ignore security. It isevident that vendors shirk on security investments in the latter case.  Regulators such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission have sanctioned Androidvendors for underinvestment in security, but the exact effects of thesesanctions are difficult to disentangle with empirical data. Here, we model theimpact of a regulator-imposed fine that incentivizes vendors to match a minimumsecurity standard. Interestingly, we show how product prices will decrease forthe same cost of customization in the presence of a fine, or a higher level ofregulator-imposed minimum security.

Get Your Workload in Order: Game Theoretic Prioritization of Database  Auditing

  For enhancing the privacy protections of databases, where the increasingamount of detailed personal data is stored and processed, multiple mechanismshave been developed, such as audit logging and alert triggers, which notifyadministrators about suspicious activities; however, the two main limitationsin common are: 1) the volume of such alerts is often substantially greater thanthe capabilities of resource-constrained organizations, and 2) strategicattackers may disguise their actions or carefully choosing which records theytouch, making incompetent the statistical detection models. For solving them,we introduce a novel approach to database auditing that explicitly accounts foradversarial behavior by 1) prioritizing the order in which types of alerts areinvestigated and 2) providing an upper bound on how much resource to allocatefor each type. We model the interaction between a database auditor andpotential attackers as a Stackelberg game in which the auditor chooses anauditing policy and attackers choose which records to target. A correspondingapproach combining linear programming, column generation, and heuristic searchis proposed to derive an auditing policy. For testing the policy-searchingperformance, a publicly available credit card application dataset are adopted,on which it shows that our methods produce high-quality mixed strategies asdatabase audit policies, and our general approach significantly outperformsnon-game-theoretic baselines.

TRANSAX: A Blockchain-based Decentralized Forward-Trading Energy  Exchange for Transactive Microgrids

  Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewableenergy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasingcomplexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, whicharrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionalityof these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers withconsumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challengesthat these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacychallenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data foreach participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information.Trust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promisedenergy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging due to the possibility offailures in the infrastructure that is required to support these market basedsolutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for transactivemicrogrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovativecombination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middlewarewithin a framework of a novel distributed application platform, calledResilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid. Towards thispurpose, we describe the key architectural concepts, including fault tolerance,and show the trade-off between market efficiency and resource requirements.

Augmenting Learning Components for Safety in Resource Constrained  Autonomous Robots

  Learning enabled components (LECs) trained using data-driven algorithms areincreasingly being used in autonomous robots commonly found in factories,hospitals, and educational laboratories. However, these LECs do not provide anysafety guarantees, and testing them is challenging. In this paper, we introducea framework that performs weighted simplex strategy based supervised safetycontrol, resource management and confidence estimation of autonomous robots.Specifically, we describe two weighted simplex strategies: (a) simple weightedsimplex strategy (SW-Simplex) that computes a weighted controller output bycomparing the decisions between a safety supervisor and an LEC, and (b) acontext-sensitive weighted simplex strategy (CSW-Simplex) that computes acontext-aware weighted controller output. We use reinforcement learning tolearn the contextual weights. We also introduce a system monitor that uses thecurrent state information and a Bayesian network model learned from past datato estimate the probability of the robotic system staying in the safe workingregion. To aid resource constrained robots in performing complex computationsof these weighted simplex strategies, we describe a resource manager thatoffloads tasks to an available fog nodes. The paper also describes a hardwaretestbed called DeepNNCar, which is a low cost resource-constrained RC car,built to perform autonomous driving. Using the hardware, we show that bothSW-Simplex and CSW-Simplex have 40\% and 60\% fewer safety violations, whiledemonstrating higher optimized speed during indoor driving\textbf{($\sim\,0.40\,m/s$)} than the original system (using only LECs).

Cyber-Physical Simulation Platform for Security Assessment of  Transactive Energy Systems

  Transactive energy systems (TES) are emerging as a transformative solutionfor the problems that distribution system operators face due to an increase inthe use of distributed energy resources and rapid growth in scalability ofmanaging active distribution system (ADS). On the one hand, these changes posea decentralized power system control problem, requiring strategic control tomaintain reliability and resiliency for the community and for the utility. Onthe other hand, they require robust financial markets while allowingparticipation from diverse prosumers. To support the computing and flexibilityrequirements of TES while preserving privacy and security, distributed softwareplatforms are required. In this paper, we enable the study and analysis ofsecurity concerns by developing Transactive Energy Security Simulation Testbed(TESST), a TES testbed for simulating various cyber attacks. In this work, thetestbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market,highlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present ablockchain enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributedcomputing for TES, which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that weidentify, but on the other hand, may introduce newer issues. Future study ofthese differing paradigms is necessary and will continue as we develop oursecurity simulation testbed.

Optimal Thresholds for Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection in Dynamical  Environments

  In cyber-physical systems, malicious and resourceful attackers couldpenetrate the system through cyber means and cause significant physical damage.Consequently, detection of such attacks becomes integral towards making thesesystems resilient to attacks. To achieve this objective, intrusion detectionsystems (IDS) that are able to detect malicious behavior can be deployed.However, practical IDS are imperfect and sometimes they may produce falsealarms for a normal system behavior. Since alarms need to be investigated forany potential damage, a large number of false alarms may increase theoperational costs significantly. Thus, IDS need to be configured properly, asoversensitive IDS could detect attacks early but at the cost of a higher numberof false alarms. Similarly, IDS with low sensitivity could reduce the falsealarms while increasing the time to detect the attacks. The configuration ofIDS to strike the right balance between time to detecting attacks and the rateof false positives is a challenging task, especially in dynamic environments,in which the damage incurred by a successful attack is time-varying.  In this paper, we study the problem of finding optimal detection thresholdsfor anomaly-based detectors implemented in dynamical systems in the face ofstrategic attacks. We formulate the problem as an attacker-defender securitygame, and determine thresholds for the detector to achieve an optimal trade-offbetween the detection delay and the false positive rates. In this direction,first, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal fixed threshold thatremains fixed throughout. Second, we allow detector's threshold to change withtime to further minimize the defender's loss and provide an algorithm tocompute time-varying thresholds, which we call adaptive thresholds. Finally, wenumerically evaluate our results using a water distribution network as acase-study.
