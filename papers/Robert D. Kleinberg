Fast matrix multiplication is stable

  We perform forward error analysis for a large class of recursive matrixmultiplication algorithms in the spirit of [D. Bini and G. Lotti, Stability offast algorithms for matrix multiplication, Numer. Math. 36 (1980), 63--72]. Asa consequence of our analysis, we show that the exponent of matrixmultiplication (the optimal running time) can be achieved by numerically stablealgorithms. We also show that new group-theoretic algorithms proposed in [H.Cohn, and C. Umans, A group-theoretic approach to fast matrix multiplication,FOCS 2003, 438--449] and [H. Cohn, R. Kleinberg, B. Szegedy and C. Umans,Group-theoretic algorithms for matrix multiplication, FOCS 2005, 379--388] areall included in the class of algorithms to which our analysis applies, and aretherefore numerically stable. We perform detailed error analysis for threespecific fast group-theoretic algorithms.

Analysis of a continuous-time model of structural balance

  It is not uncommon for certain social networks to divide into two opposingcamps in response to stress. This happens, for example, in networks ofpolitical parties during winner-takes-all elections, in networks of companiescompeting to establish technical standards, and in networks of nations facedwith mounting threats of war. A simple model for these two-sided separations isthe dynamical system dX/dt = X^2 where X is a matrix of the friendliness orunfriendliness between pairs of nodes in the network. Previous simulationssuggested that only two types of behavior were possible for this system: eitherall relationships become friendly, or two hostile factions emerge. Here weprove that for generic initial conditions, these are indeed the only possibleoutcomes. Our analysis yields a closed-form expression for faction membershipas a function of the initial conditions, and implies that the initial amount offriendliness in large social networks (started from random initial conditions)determines whether they will end up in intractable conflict or global harmony.

Polymatroid Prophet Inequalities

  Consider a gambler and a prophet who observe a sequence of independent,non-negative numbers. The gambler sees the numbers one-by-one whereas theprophet sees the entire sequence at once. The goal of both is to decide onfractions of each number they want to keep so as to maximize the weightedfractional sum of the numbers chosen.  The classic result of Krengel and Sucheston (1977-78) asserts that if boththe gambler and the prophet can pick one number, then the gambler can do atleast half as well as the prophet. Recently, Kleinberg and Weinberg (2012) havegeneralized this result to settings where the numbers that can be chosen aresubject to a matroid constraint.  In this note we go one step further and show that the bound carries over tosettings where the fractions that can be chosen are subject to a polymatroidconstraint. This bound is tight as it is already tight for the simple settingwhere the gambler and the prophet can pick only one number. An interestingapplication of our result is in mechanism design, where it leads to improvedresults for various problems.

Approximating Low-Dimensional Coverage Problems

  We study the complexity of the maximum coverage problem, restricted to setsystems of bounded VC-dimension. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractableapproximation scheme: an algorithm that outputs a $(1-\eps)$-approximation tothe maximum-cardinality union of $k$ sets, in running time $O(f(\eps,k,d)\cdotpoly(n))$ where $n$ is the problem size, $d$ is the VC-dimension of the setsystem, and $f(\eps,k,d)$ is exponential in $(kd/\eps)^c$ for some constant$c$. We complement this positive result by showing that the function$f(\eps,k,d)$ in the running-time bound cannot be replaced by a functiondepending only on $(\eps,d)$ or on $(k,d)$, under standard complexityassumptions.  We also present an improved upper bound on the approximation ratio of thegreedy algorithm in special cases of the problem, including when the sets havebounded cardinality and when they are two-dimensional halfspaces. Complementingthese positive results, we show that when the sets are four-dimensionalhalfspaces neither the greedy algorithm nor local search is capable ofimproving the worst-case approximation ratio of $1-1/e$ that the greedyalgorithm achieves on arbitrary instances of maximum coverage.

The Lov√°sz Theta Function for Random Regular Graphs and Community  Detection in the Hard Regime

  We derive upper and lower bounds on the degree $d$ for which the Lov\'asz$\vartheta$ function, or equivalently sum-of-squares proofs with degree two,can refute the existence of a $k$-coloring in random regular graphs $G_{n,d}$.We show that this type of refutation fails well above the $k$-colorabilitytransition, and in particular everywhere below the Kesten-Stigum threshold.This is consistent with the conjecture that refuting $k$-colorability, ordistinguishing $G_{n,d}$ from the planted coloring model, is hard in thisregion. Our results also apply to the disassortative case of the stochasticblock model, adding evidence to the conjecture that there is a regime wherecommunity detection is computationally hard even though it isinformation-theoretically possible. Using orthogonal polynomials, we alsoprovide explicit upper bounds on $\vartheta(\overline{G})$ for regular graphsof a given girth, which may be of independent interest.

Prophet Inequalities with Limited Information

  In the classical prophet inequality, a gambler observes a sequence ofstochastic rewards $V_1,...,V_n$ and must decide, for each reward $V_i$,whether to keep it and stop the game or to forfeit the reward forever andreveal the next value $V_i$. The gambler's goal is to obtain a constantfraction of the expected reward that the optimal offline algorithm would get.Recently, prophet inequalities have been generalized to settings where thegambler can choose $k$ items, and, more generally, where he can choose anyindependent set in a matroid. However, all the existing algorithms require thegambler to know the distribution from which the rewards $V_1,...,V_n$ aredrawn.  The assumption that the gambler knows the distribution from which$V_1,...,V_n$ are drawn is very strong. Instead, we work with the much simplerassumption that the gambler only knows a few samples from this distribution. Weconstruct the first single-sample prophet inequalities for many settings ofinterest, whose guarantees all match the best possible asymptotically,\emph{even with full knowledge of the distribution}. Specifically, we provide anovel single-sample algorithm when the gambler can choose any $k$ elementswhose analysis is based on random walks with limited correlation. In addition,we provide a black-box method for converting specific types of solutions to therelated \emph{secretary problem} to single-sample prophet inequalities, andapply it to several existing algorithms. Finally, we provide a constant-sampleprophet inequality for constant-degree bipartite matchings.  We apply these results to design the first posted-price and multi-dimensionalauction mechanisms with limited information in settings with asymmetricbidders.

A Unified Approach to Online Allocation Algorithms via Randomized Dual  Fitting

  We present a unified framework for designing and analyzing algorithms foronline budgeted allocation problems (including online matching) and theirgeneralization, the Online Generalized Assignment Problem (OnGAP). Theseproblems have been intensively studied as models of how to allocate impressionsfor online advertising. In contrast to previous analyses of online budgetedallocation algorithms (the so-called "balance" or "water-filling" family ofalgorithms) our analysis is based on the method of randomized dual fitting,analogous to the recent analysis of the RANKING algorithm for online matchingdue to Devanur et al. Our main contribution is thus to provide a unified methodof proof that simultaneously derives the optimal competitive ratio bounds foronline matching and online fractional budgeted allocation. The same method ofproof also supplies $(1-1/e)$ competitive ratio bounds for greedy algorithmsfor both problems, in the random order arrival model; this simplifies existinganalyses of greedy online allocation algorithms with random order of arrivals,while also strengthening them to apply to a larger family of greedy algorithms.Finally, for the more general OnGAP problem, we show that no algorithm can beconstant-competitive; instead we present an algorithm whose competitive ratiodepends logarithmically on a certain parameter of the problem instance, and weshow that this dependence cannot be improved.

Simple and Near-Optimal Mechanisms For Market Intermediation

  A prevalent market structure in the Internet economy consists of buyers andsellers connected by a platform (such as Amazon or eBay) that acts as anintermediary and keeps a share of the revenue of each transaction. While theoptimal mechanism that maximizes the intermediary's profit in such a settingmay be quite complicated, the mechanisms observed in reality are generally muchsimpler, e.g., applying an affine function to the price of the transaction asthe intermediary's fee. Loertscher and Niedermayer [2007] initiated the studyof such fee-setting mechanisms in two-sided markets, and we continue thisinvestigation by addressing the question of when an affine fee schedule isapproximately optimal for worst-case seller distribution. On one hand our worksupplies non-trivial sufficient conditions on the buyer side (i.e. linearity ofmarginal revenue function, or MHR property of value and value minus costdistributions) under which an affine fee schedule can obtain a constantfraction of the intermediary's optimal profit for all seller distributions. Onthe other hand we complement our result by showing that proper affinefee-setting mechanisms (e.g. those used in eBay and Amazon selling plans) areunable to extract a constant fraction of optimal profit in the worst-caseseller distribution. As subsidiary results we also show there exists a constantgap between maximum surplus and maximum revenue under the aforementionedconditions. Most of the mechanisms that we propose are also prior-independentwith respect to the seller, which signifies the practical implications of ourresult.

Truthful Mechanisms with Implicit Payment Computation

  It is widely believed that computing payments needed to induce truthfulbidding is somehow harder than simply computing the allocation. We show thatthe opposite is true: creating a randomized truthful mechanism is essentiallyas easy as a single call to a monotone allocation rule. Our main result is ageneral procedure to take a monotone allocation rule for a single-parameterdomain and transform it (via a black-box reduction) into a randomized mechanismthat is truthful in expectation and individually rational for everyrealization. The mechanism implements the same outcome as the originalallocation rule with probability arbitrarily close to 1, and requiresevaluating that allocation rule only once. We also provide an extension of thisresult to multi-parameter domains and cycle-monotone allocation rules, undermild star-convexity and non-negativity hypotheses on the type space andallocation rule, respectively.  Because our reduction is simple, versatile, and general, it has manyapplications to mechanism design problems in which re-evaluating the allocationrule is either burdensome or informationally impossible. Applying our result tothe multi-armed bandit problem, we obtain truthful randomized mechanisms whoseregret matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to logarithmic factors,even though prior work showed this is impossible for truthful deterministicmechanisms. We also present applications to offline mechanism design, showingthat randomization can circumvent a communication complexity lower bound fordeterministic payments computation, and that it can also be used to createtruthful shortest path auctions that approximate the welfare of the VCGallocation arbitrarily well, while having the same running time complexity asDijkstra's algorithm.
