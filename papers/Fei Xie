  We prove the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing and another Kodaira-type vanishingfor projective toric surfaces over arbitrary fields.

Generalized integral fluctuation relation with feedback control for  diffusion processes

  We extend a generalized integral fluctuation relation in diffusion processesthat we obtained previously to the situation with feedback control. The generalrelation not only covers existing results but also predicts other unnoticedfluctuation relations. In addition, we find that its explanation oftime-reversal automatically emerges in the derivation. This interestingobservation leads into an alternative inequality about the entropy-likequantity with an improved lower bound. Two feedback-controlled Brownian modelsare used to verify the result.

A Multigrid Method for the Ground State Solution of Bose-Einstein  Condensates Based on Newton Iteration

  In this paper, a new kind of multigrid method is proposed for the groundstate solution of Bose-Einstein condensates based on Newton iteration method.Instead of treating eigenvalue $\lambda$ and eigenvector $u$ respectively, weregard the eigenpair $(\lambda, u)$ as one element in the composite space $\R\times H_0^1(\Omega)$ and then Newton iteration method is adopted for thenonlinear problem. Thus in this multigrid scheme, we only need to solve alinear discrete boundary value problem in every refined space, which canimprove the overall efficiency for the simulation of Bose-Einsteincondensations.

Toric surfaces over an arbitrary field

  We study toric varieties over an arbitrary field with an emphasis on toricsurfaces in the Merkurjev-Panin motivic category of "K-motives". We explore thedecomposition of certain toric varieties as K-motives into products of centralsimple algebras, the geometric and topological information encoded in thesecentral simple algebras, and the relationship between the decomposition of theK-motives and the semiorthogonal decomposition of the derived categories. Weobtain the information mentioned above for toric surfaces by explicitlyclassifying all minimal smooth projective toric surfaces using toric geometry.

A Study of Background Conditions for Sphinx--The Satellite-Borne  Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter

  SPHiNX is a proposed satellite-borne gamma-ray burst polarimeter operating inthe energy range 50-500 keV. The mission aims to probe the fundamentalmechanism responsible for gamma-ray burst prompt emission through polarisationmeasurements. Optimising the signal-to-background ratio for SPHiNX is animportant task during the design phase. The Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit is usedin this work. From the simulation, the total background outside the SouthAtlantic Anomaly (SAA) is about 323 counts/s, which is dominated by the cosmicX-ray background and albedo gamma rays, which contribute ~60% and ~35% of thetotal background, respectively. The background from albedo neutrons and primaryand secondary cosmic rays is negligible. The delayed background induced by theSAA-trapped protons is about 190 counts/s when SPHiNX operates in orbit for oneyear. The resulting total background level of ~513 counts/s allows thepolarisation of ~50 GRBs with minimum detectable polarisation less than 30% tobe determined during the two-year mission lifetime.

A Full Multigrid Method for Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems

  This paper is to introduce a type of full multigrid method for the nonlineareigenvalue problem. The main idea is to transform the solution of nonlineareigenvalue problem into a series of solutions of the corresponding linearboundary value problems on the sequence of finite element spaces and nonlineareigenvalue problems on the coarsest finite element space. The linearizedboundary value problems are solved by some multigrid iterations. Besides themultigrid iteration, all other efficient iteration methods for solving boundaryvalue problems can serve as the linear problem solver. We will prove that thecomputational work of this new scheme is truly optimal, the same as solving thelinear corresponding boundary value problem. In this case, this type ofiteration scheme certainly improves the overfull efficiency of solvingnonlinear eigenvalue problems. Some numerical experiments are presented tovalidate the efficiency of the new method.

A complicated Duffing oscillator in the surface-electrode ion trap

  The oscillation coupling and different nonlinear effects are observed in asingle trapped $^{40}Ca^{+}$ ion confined in our home-built surface-electrodetrap (SET). The coupling and the nonlinearity are originated from thehigh-order multipole potentials due to different layouts and the fabricationasymmetry of the SET. We solve a complicated Duffing equation with coupledoscillation terms by the multiple scale method, which fits the experimentalvalues very well. Our investigation in the SET helps for exploring nonlinearityusing currently available techniques and for suppressing instability of qubitsin quantum information processing with trapped ions.

Interferometric characterization of pulse front tilt of spatiotemporally  focused femtosecond laser pulses for three-dimensional micromachining  application

  We report on an experimental measurement of the pulse front tilt (PFT) ofspatiotemporally focused femtosecond laser pulses in the focal plane in bothair and bulk transparent materials, which is achieved by examination of theinterference pattern between the spatiotemporally focused pulse and aconventional focused reference pulse as a function of time delay between thetwo pulses. Our simulation results agree well with the experimentalobservations.

Time-resolved shadowgraphs of transient plasma induced by  spatiotemporally focused femtosecond laser pulses in fused silica glass

  We report on experimental observations of formation and evolution oftransient plasma produced in fused silica glass with spatiotemporally focused(STF) femtosecond laser pulses using a pump-probe shadow imaging technique.Surprisingly, the observation shows that the track of the plasma issignificantly curved, which is attributed to an asymmetric density distributionof the transient plasma produced in the focal volume caused by the pulse fronttilt of the STF laser field.

The Synthesis, Structure and Electronic Properties of a Lead-Free Hybrid  Inorganic-Organic Double Perovskite (MA)2KBiCl6 (MA = methylammonium)

  In a search for Lead-free materials that could be used as alternatives to thehybrid perovskites,(MA)PbX3, in photovoltaic applications, we have discovered ahybrid double perovskite, (MA)2KBiCl6, which shows striking similarities to thelead analogues. Spectroscopic measurements and nanoindentation studies arecombined with density functional calculations to reveal the properties of thisinteresting system.

A Real-Time and Energy-Efficient Implementation of  Difference-of-Gaussian with Flexible Thin-Film Transistors

  With many advantageous features, softness and better biocompatibility,flexible electronic devices have developed rapidly and increasingly attractedattention. Many currently applications with flexible devices are sensors anddrivers, while there is nearly no utilization aiming at complex computationsince flexible devices have lower electron mobility, simple structure and largeprocess variation. In this paper, we proposed an innovative method that enabledflexible devices to implement real-time and energy-efficientDifference-of-Gaussian, which illustrated feasibility and potentials for themto achieve complicated real-time computation in future generation products.

Simulation of the In-flight Background for HXMT/HE

  The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) is a broad band X-ray astronomicalsatellite from 1 to 250 keV. Understanding the X-ray background in detail willhelp to achieve a good performance of the instrument. In this work, we make useof the mass modelling technique to estimate the background of High EnergyTelescope (HE) aboard HXMT. It consists of three steps. First, we built acomplete geometric model of HXMT. Then based on the investigation about thespace environment concerning HXMT low-earth orbit, in our simulation weconsidered cosmic rays, cosmic X-ray background (CXB), South Atlantic Anomaly(SAA) trapped particles, the albedo gamma and neutrons from interaction ofcosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the Shielding Physics Listsupplied by Geant4 collaborations was adopted. According to our simulation, (1)the total background of HXMT/HE is about 540 count/s on average over 20-250 keVenergy band after 100 days in orbit; (2) the delayed component caused by cosmicrays and SAA trapped particles dominates the full energy band of HXMT/HE; (3)some emission lines are prominent in the background continuum spectrum and willbe used for in-orbit calibration; (4) the estimated sensitivity isapproximately 0.1 mCrab at 50 keV with an exposure of $10^{6}$ s.

Microscopic Theory of Equilibrium Polariton Condensates

  We present a microscopic theory of the equilibrium polariton condensate stateof a semiconductor quantum well in a planar optical cavity. The theory accountsfor the adjustment of matter excitations to the presence of a coherent photonfield, predicts effective polariton-polariton interaction strengths that areweaker and condensate exciton fractions that are smaller than in the commonlyemployed exciton-photon model, and yields effective Rabi coupling strengthsthat depend on the detuning of the cavity photon energy relative to the bareexciton energy. The dressed quasiparticle bands that appear naturally in thetheory provide a mechanism for electrical manipulation of polaritoncondensates.

Integrated four-channel all-fiber up-conversion single-photon-detector  with adjustable efficiency and dark count

  Up-conversion single photon detector (UCSPD) has been widely used in manyresearch fields including quantum key distribution (QKD), lidar, optical timedomain reflectrometry (OTDR) and deep space communication. For the first timein laboratory, we have developed an integrated four-channel all-fiber UCSPDwhich can work in both free-running and gate modes. This compact module cansatisfy different experimental demands with adjustable detection efficiency anddark count. We have characterized the key parameters of the UCSPD system.

A Full Multigrid Method For Semilinear Elliptic Equation

  A full multigrid finite element method is proposed for semilinear ellipticequations. The main idea is to transform the solution of the semilinear probleminto a series of solutions of the corresponding linear boundary value problemson the sequence of finite element spaces and semilinear problems on a very lowdimensional space. The linearized boundary value problems are solved by somemultigrid iterations. Besides the multigrid iteration, all other efficientnumerical methods can also serve as the linear solver for solving boundaryvalue problems. The optimality of the computational work is also proved.Compared with the existing multigrid methods which need the bounded secondorder derivatives of the nonlinear term, the proposed method only needs theLipschitz continuation in some sense of the nonlinear term.

An Efficient Multigrid Method for Ground State Solution of Bose-Einstein  Condensates

  An efficient multigrid method is proposed to compute the ground statesolution of Bose-Einstein condensations by the finite element method based onthe combination of the multigrid method for nonlinear eigenvalue problem and anefficient implementation for the nonlinear iteration. The proposed numericalmethod not only has the optimal convergence rate, but also has theasymptotically optimal computational work which is independent from thenonlinearity of the problem. The independence from the nonlinearity means thatthe asymptotic estimate of the computational work can reach almost the same asthat of solving the corresponding linear boundary value problem by themultigrid method. Some numerical experiments are provided to validate theefficiency of the proposed method.

Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network

  Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants have recently attractedintensive research interests due to their elegant theoretical foundation andexcellent empirical performance as generative models. These tools provide apromising direction in the studies where data availability is limited. Onecommon issue in GANs is that the density of the learned generative distributioncould concentrate on the training data points, meaning that they can easilyremember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks.This becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to private or sensitive datasuch as patient medical records, and the concentration of distribution maydivulge critical patient information. To address this issue, in this paper wepropose a differentially private GAN (DPGAN) model, in which we achievedifferential privacy in GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradientsduring the learning procedure. We provide rigorous proof for the privacyguarantee, as well as comprehensive empirical evidence to support our analysis,where we demonstrate that our method can generate high quality data points at areasonable privacy level.

Second-order photonic topological insulator with corner states

  Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) which go beyond the descriptionof conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, broaden the understanding oftopological insulating phases. Being mainly focused on electronic materials,HOTIs have not been found in photonic systems yet. In this article, we proposea type of two-dimensional second-order photonic crystals with zero-dimensionalcorner states and one-dimensional boundary states for optical frequencies. Allof these states are topologically non-trivial and can be understood based onthe theory of topological polarization. Moreover, by tuning theeasily-fabricated structure of the photonic crystals, we can realize differenttopological phases with unique topological boundary states straightforwardly.Our result can be generalized to higher dimensions and provides unprecedentedvenues for higher-order photonic topological insulators and semimetals.

Electronic identification of the actual parental phase of KxFe2-ySe2  superconductor and its intrinsic mesoscopic phase separation

  While the parent compounds of the cuprate high temperature superconductors(high-Tc's) are Mott insulators, the iron-pnictide high-Tc's are in thevicinity of a metallic spin density wave (SDW) state, which highlights thedifference between these two families. However, insulating parent compoundswere identified for the newly discovered KxFe2-ySe2. This raises an intriguingquestion as to whether the iron-based high-Tc's could be viewed as doped Mottinsulators like the cuprates. Here we report angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy (ARPES) evidence of two insulating and one semiconducting phasesof KxFe2-ySe2, and the mesoscopic phase separation between thesuperconducting/semiconducting phase and the insulating phases. The insulatingphases are characterized by the depletion of electronic states over a 0.5 eVwindow below the chemical potential, giving a compelling evidence for thepresence of Mott-like physics. The charging effects and the absence of bandfolding in the superconducting/semiconducting phase further prove that thestatic magnetic and vacancy orders are not related to the superconductivity.Instead, the electronic structure of the superconducting phase is much closerto the semiconducting phase, indicating the superconductivity is likelydeveloped by doping the semiconducting phase rather than the insulating phases.

Attentive Sequence to Sequence Translation for Localizing Clips of  Interest by Natural Language Descriptions

  We propose a novel attentive sequence to sequence translator (ASST) for cliplocalization in videos by natural language descriptions. We make twocontributions. First, we propose a bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) with a finely calibrated vision-language attentive mechanism tocomprehensively understand the free-formed natural language descriptions. TheRNN parses natural language descriptions in two directions, and the attentivemodel attends every meaningful word or phrase to each frame, thereby resultingin a more detailed understanding of video content and description semantics.Second, we design a hierarchical architecture for the network to jointly modellanguage descriptions and video content. Given a video-description pair, thenetwork generates a matrix representation, i.e., a sequence of vectors. Eachvector in the matrix represents a video frame conditioned by the description.The 2D representation not only preserves the temporal dependencies of framesbut also provides an effective way to perform frame-level video-languagematching. The hierarchical architecture exploits video content with multiplegranularities, ranging from subtle details to global context. Integration ofthe multiple granularities yields a robust representation for multi-levelvideo-language abstraction. We validate the effectiveness of our ASST on twolarge-scale datasets. Our ASST outperforms the state-of-the-art by $4.28\%$ inRank$@1$ on the DiDeMo dataset. On the Charades-STA dataset, we significantlyimprove the state-of-the-art by $13.41\%$ in Rank$@1,IoU=0.5$.

The first laws of thermodynamics of the (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black  holes and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes

  We investigate the first law of thermodynamics in the case of the(2+1)-dimensional BTZ black holes and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes, in particular,we focus on the integral mass formulas. It is found that by assuming thecosmological constant as a variable state parameter, both the differential andintegral mass formulas of the first law of black hole thermodynamics in theasymptotic flat spacetimes can be directly extended to those of rotating blackholes in anti-de Sitter and de Sitter backgrounds. It should be pointed thatthese formulas come into existence in any dimensions also.

Electronic structure of BaNi$_2$As$_2$

  BaNi$_2$As$_2$, with a first order phase transition around 131 K, is studiedby the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The measured electronicstructure is compared to the local density approximation calculations,revealing similar large electronlike bands around $\bar{M}$ and differencesalong $\bar{\Gamma}$-$\bar{X}$. We further show that the electronic structureof BaNi$_2$As$_2$ is distinct from that of the sibling iron pnictides.Particularly, there is no signature of band folding, indicating no collinearSDW related magnetic ordering. Moreover, across the strong first order phasetransition, the band shift exhibits a hysteresis, which is directly related tothe significant lattice distortion in BaNi$_2$As$_2$.

The distinct in-plane resistivity anisotropy in the nematic states of  detwinned NaFeAs and FeTe single crystals: evidences for Hund's rule metal

  The in-plane resistivity anisotropy has been studied with the Montgomerymethod on two detwinned parent compounds of the iron-based superconductors,NaFeAs and FeTe. For NaFeAs, the resistivity in the antiferromagnetic (AFM)direction is smaller than that in the ferromagnetic (FM) direction, similar tothat observed in BaFe2As2 before. While for FeTe, the resistivity in the AFMdirection is larger than that in the FM direction. We show that these twoopposite resistivity anisotropy behaviors could be attributed to the strongHund's rule coupling effects: while the iron pnictides are in the itinerantregime, where the Hund's rule coupling causes strong reconstruction andnematicity of the electronic structure; the FeTe is in the localized regime,where Hund's rule coupling makes hopping along the FM direction easier thanalong the AFMdirection, similar to the colossal magnetoresistance observed insome manganites.

A good mass proxy for galaxy clusters with XMM-Newton

  We use a sample of 39 galaxy clusters at redshift z < 0.1 observed byXMM-Newton to investigate the relations between X-ray observables and totalmass. Based on central cooling time and central temperature drop, the clustersin this sample are divided into two groups: 25 cool core clusters and 14non-cool core clusters, respectively. We study the scaling relations ofLbol-M500, M500-T, M500-Mg and M500-YX, and also the influences of cool core onthese relations. The results show that the M500-YX relation has a slope closeto the standard self-similar value, has the smallest scatter and does not varywith the cluster sample. Moreover, the M500-YX relation is not affected by thecool core. Thus, the parameter of YX may be the best mass indicator.

Second harmonic generation in a centrosymmetric gas medium with  spatiotemporally focused intense femtosecond laser pulses

  We demonstrate unexpectedly strong second harmonic generation (SHG) in Argongas by use of spatiotemporally focused (SF) femtosecond laser pulses. Theresulting SHG by the SF scheme at a 75 cm distance shows a significantlyenhanced efficiency than that achieved with conventional focusing scheme, whichoffers a new promising possibility for standoff applications. Our theoreticalcalculations reasonably reproduce the experimental observations, which indicatethat the observed SHG mainly originates from the gradient of nonuniform plasmadynamically controlled by the SF laser field.

Using ACL2 to Verify Loop Pipelining in Behavioral Synthesis

  Behavioral synthesis involves compiling an Electronic System-Level (ESL)design into its Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementation. Loop pipeliningis one of the most critical and complex transformations employed in behavioralsynthesis. Certifying the loop pipelining algorithm is challenging becausethere is a huge semantic gap between the input sequential design and the outputpipelined implementation making it infeasible to verify their equivalence withautomated sequential equivalence checking techniques. We discuss our ongoingeffort using ACL2 to certify loop pipelining transformation. The completion ofthe proof is work in progress. However, some of the insights developed so farmay already be of value to the ACL2 community. In particular, we discuss thekey invariant we formalized, which is very different from that used in mostpipeline proofs. We discuss the needs for this invariant, its formalization inACL2, and our envisioned proof using the invariant. We also discuss sometrade-offs, challenges, and insights developed in course of the project.

Spatiotemporal focusing does not always improve axial intensity  localization

  We report on an experimental comparison on critical intensities of nonlinearself-focusing in air with conventional focusing and spatiotemporal focusingschemes. Our results show that the conventional focusing with the focal lenscompletely filled with the incident beam allows for the strongest axialintensity confinement against the self-focusing effect. This is because that inthe high-numerical-aperture condition, the focal spot will have a compact sizewhich results in a high focal intensity. Meanwhile, the Rayleigh length of thefocused beam will be substantially shortened which efficiently postpones theonset of self-focusing.

Synthesis, Crystal Structure and Properties of a Perovskite-Related  Bismuth Phase, (NH4)3Bi2I9

  Organic-inorganic halide perovskites, especially methylammonium lead halide,have recently led to a remarkable breakthrough in photovoltaic devices.However, due to the environmental and stability concerns of the heavy metal,lead, in these perovskite based solar cells, research in the non-leadperovskite structures have been attracting increasing attention. In this study,a layered perovskite-like architecture, (NH4)3Bi2I9, was prepared in solutionand the structure was solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The resultsfrom DFT calculations showed the significant lone pair effect of the bismuthion and the band gap was measured as around 2.04 eV, which is lower than theband gap of CH3NH3PbBr3. Conductivity measurement was also performed to examinethe potential in the applications as an alternative to the lead containingperovskites.

OpenRISC System-on-Chip Design Emulation

  Recently the hardware emulation technique has emerged as a promising approachto accelerating hardware verification/debugging process. To fully evaluate thepowerfulness of the emulation approach and demonstrate its potential impact, wepropose to emulate a system-on-chip (SoC) design using Mentor Graphics Veloceemulation platform. This article presents our project setup and the results wehave achieved. The results are encouraging. ORPSoC emulation with Veloce hasmore than ten times faster than hardware simulation. Our experimental resultsdemonstrate that Mentor Graphics Veloce has major advantages in emulation,verification, and debugging of complicated real hardware designs, especially inthe context of SoC complexity. Through our three major tasks, we willdemonstrate that (1) Veloce can successfully emulate large-scale SoC designs;(2) it has much better performance comparing to the state-of-the-art simulationtools; (3) it can significantly accelerate the process of hardware verificationand debugging while maintaining full signal visibility.

Experimental Adiabatic Quantum Factorization under Ambient Conditions  Based on a Solid-State Single Spin System

  The adiabatic quantum computation is a universal and robust method of quantumcomputing. In this architecture, the problem can be solved by adiabaticallyevolving the quantum processor from the ground state of a simple initialHamiltonian to that of a final one, which encodes the solution of the problem.By far, there is no experimental realization of adiabatic quantum computationon a single solid spin system under ambient conditions, which has been provedto be a compatible candidate for scalable quantum computation. In this letter,we report on the first experimental realization of an adiabatic quantumalgorithm on a single solid spin system under ambient conditions. All elementsof adiabatic quantum computation, including initial state preparation,adiabatic evolution, and final state readout, are realized experimentally. Asan example, we factored 35 into its prime factors 5 and 7 on our adiabaticquantum processor.

Probing Lepton Flavor Violation Signal via γγ\to l_i\barl_j in  the Left-Right Twin Higgs Model at the ILC

  To explain the small neutrino masses, heavy Majorana neutrinos are introducedin the left-right twin Higgs model. The heavy neutrinos, together with thecharged scalars and the heavy gauge bosons, may contribute large mixingsbetween the neutrinos and the charged leptons, which may induce some distinctlepton flavor violating processes. We will check the \bar \ell_i \ell_j (i,j=e,\mu,\tau,i\neq j) productions in the \gamma\gamma collision in the left-righttwin Higgs model, and find that the production rates may be large in somespecific parameter space, in the optimal cases even possible to be detectedwith reasonable kinematical cuts. we have also shown that these collisions canconstrain effectively the model parameters such as the Higgs vacuum expectationvalue and the right-handed neutrino mass, etc., and may serve as a sensitiveprobe of this new physics model.

1.064-um-band up-conversion single-photon detector

  Based on the technique of periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN)waveguide, up-conversion single-photon detection at 1.064-{\mu}m isdemonstrated. We have achieved a system photon detection efficiency (DE) of32.5% with a very low noise count rate (NCR) of 45 counts per second (cps) bypumping with a 1.55-{\mu}m-band single frequency laser using thelong-wavelength pumping technique and exploiting volume Bragg grating (VBG) asa narrow band filter. Replacing the VBG with a combination of adequatedielectric filters, a DE of up to 38% with a NCR of 700 cps is achieved, makingthe overall system more stable and practical. The up-conversion single-photondetector (SPD) operating at 1.064 {\mu}m can be a promising robust counter andfind usage in many fields.

Highly Deformable and Mobile Palladium Nanocrystals as Efficient Carbon  Scavengers

  Fouling of surfaces leads to performance degradation in many energy-intensiveindustrial processes, but the present solutions are either too complicated tobe routinely used or incomplete for eradication. Here we propose anddemonstrate that carbon-containing deposits can be catalytically wiped out inan efficient way by roaming palladium nanoparticles with extreme shapeflexibility at relatively low temperatures. Surprisingly, during their dramaticliquid-like migrations, these particles could still maintain crystallineinterior and conserve their initial crystal orientations through self-surfacediffusion. Moreover, these catalytic particles were even able to becomeregenerated by other roaming particles after occasionally deactivated bysurface coking or multiple-particle sintering. These findings shed light onmetabolically driven, "living" nanocrystals, and also open a new avenue forefficient catalysis.

Fast OBDD Reordering using Neural Message Passing on Hypergraph

  Ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) are an efficient data structure forrepresenting and manipulating Boolean formulas. With respect to differentvariable orders, the OBDDs' sizes may vary from linear to exponential in thenumber of the Boolean variables. Finding the optimal variable order has beenproved a NP-complete problem. Many heuristics have been proposed to find anear-optimal solution of this problem. In this paper, we propose a neuralnetwork-based method to predict near-optimal variable orders for unknownformulas. Viewing these formulas as hypergraphs, and lifting the messagepassing neural network into 3-hypergraph (MPNN3), we are able to learn thepatterns of Boolean formula. Compared to the traditional methods, our methodcan find a near-the-best solution with an extremely shorter time, even for somehard examples.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on applyingneural network to OBDD reordering.

Segregated Temporal Assembly Recurrent Networks for Weakly Supervised  Multiple Action Detection

  This paper proposes a segregated temporal assembly recurrent (STAR) networkfor weakly-supervised multiple action detection. The model learns fromuntrimmed videos with only supervision of video-level labels and makesprediction of intervals of multiple actions. Specifically, we first assemblevideo clips according to class labels by an attention mechanism that learnsclass-variable attention weights and thus helps the noise relieving frombackground or other actions. Secondly, we build temporal relationship betweenactions by feeding the assembled features into an enhanced recurrent neuralnetwork. Finally, we transform the output of recurrent neural network into thecorresponding action distribution. In order to generate more precise temporalproposals, we design a score term called segregated temporal gradient-weightedclass activation mapping (ST-GradCAM) fused with attention weights. Experimentson THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets show that our approach outperforms thestate-of-the-art weakly-supervised method, and performs at par with thefully-supervised counterparts.

Phase transition and anomalous scaling in the quantum Hall transport of  topological insulator Sn-Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S devices

  The scaling physics of quantum Hall transport in optimized topologicalinsulators with a plateau precision of ~1/1000 e2/h is considered. Twoexponential scaling regimes are observed in temperature-dependent transportdissipation, one of which accords with thermal activation behavior with a gapof 2.8 meV (> 20 K), the other being attributed to variable range hopping (1-20K). Magnetic field-driven plateau-to-plateau transition gives scaling relationsof (dR$_{xy}$/dB)$^{max}$ \propto T$^{-\kappa}$ and \DeltaB$^{-1}$ \proptoT$^{-\kappa}$ with a consistent exponent of \kappa ~ 0.2, which is half theuniversal value for a conventional two-dimensional electron gas. This isevidence of percolation assisted by quantum tunneling, and reveals thedominance of electron-electron interaction of the topological surface states.

Non-topological Origin of the Planar Hall Effect in Type-II Dirac  Semimetal NiTe2

  Dirac and Weyl semimetals are new discovered topological nontrivial materialswith the linear band dispersions around the Dirac/Weyl points. When applyingnon-orthogonal electric current and magnetic field, an exotic phenomenon calledchiral anomaly arises and negative longitudinal resistance can be detected.Recently, a new phenomenon named planer Hall effect (PHE) is considered to beanother indication of chiral anomaly which has been observed in manytopological semimetals. However, it still remains a question that is the PHEonly attributed to chiral anomaly? Here we demonstrate the PHE in anew-discovered type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2 by low temperature transport.However, after detailed analysis, we conclude that the PHE results from thetrivial orbital magnetoresistance. This work reveals that PHE is not asufficient condition of chiral anomaly and one need to take special care ofother non-topological contribution in such studies.

Up-conversion single-photon detectors based on integrated periodically  poled lithium niobate waveguides

  We demonstrate up-conversion single-photon detectors based on integratedperiodically poled lithium niobate waveguides, which incorporate two modefilters and a directional coupler. The two mode filters are optimized for thefiber-waveguide coupling efficiencies for 1550 nm and 1950 nm respectivelywhile the directional coupler plays the role of wavelength combiner, making theoverall system portable and low-cost. The two wavelengths pump each other inour detection system. We achieve detection efficiencies of 28% for 1550 nm and27% for 1950 nm, respectively. This scheme provides an efficient integratedsingle-photon detection method for any two well-separated spectral bands in thewhole low-loss range of lithium niobate waveguides.

Efficient Video Scene Text Spotting: Unifying Detection, Tracking, and  Recognition

  This paper proposes an unified framework for efficiently spotting scene textin videos. The method localizes and tracks text in each frame, and recognizeseach tracked text stream one-time. Specifically, we first train aspatial-temporal text detector for localizing text regions in the sequentialframes. Secondly, a well-designed text tracker is trained for grouping thelocalized text regions into corresponding cropped text streams. To efficientlyspot video text, we recognize each tracked text stream one-time with a textregion quality scoring mechanism instead of identifying the cropped textregions one-by-one. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that ourmethod achieves impressive performance.

Understanding Service Integration of Online Social Networks: A  Data-Driven Study

  The cross-site linking function is widely adopted by online social networks(OSNs). This function allows a user to link her account on one OSN to heraccounts on other OSNs. Thus, users are able to sign in with the linkedaccounts, share contents among these accounts and import friends from them. Itleads to the service integration of different OSNs. This integration not onlyprovides convenience for users to manage accounts of different OSNs, but alsointroduces usefulness to OSNs that adopt the cross-site linking function. Inthis paper, we investigate this usefulness based on users' data collected froma popular OSN called Medium. We conduct a thorough analysis on its socialgraph, and find that the service integration brought by the cross-site linkingfunction is able to change Medium's social graph structure and attract a largenumber of new users. However, almost none of the new users would become highPageRank users (PageRank is used to measure a user's influence in an OSN). Tosolve this problem, we build a machine-learning-based model to predict highPageRank users in Medium based on their Twitter data only. This model achievesa high F1-score of 0.942 and a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.986. Basedon it, we design a system to assist new OSNs to identify and attract highPageRank users from other well-established OSNs through the cross-site linkingfunction.

High-throughput, high-resolution registration-free generated adversarial  network microscopy

  We combine generative adversarial network (GAN) with light microscopy toachieve deep learning super-resolution under a large field of view (FOV). Byappropriately adopting prior microscopy data in an adversarial training, theneural network can recover a high-resolution, accurate image of new specimenfrom its single low-resolution measurement. Its capacity has been broadlydemonstrated via imaging various types of samples, such as USAF resolutiontarget, human pathological slides, fluorescence-labelled fibroblast cells, anddeep tissues in transgenic mouse brain, by both wide-field and light-sheetmicroscopes. The gigapixel, multi-color reconstruction of these samplesverifies a successful GAN-based single image super-resolution procedure. Wealso propose an image degrading model to generate low resolution images fortraining, making our approach free from the complex image registration duringtraining dataset preparation. After a welltrained network being created, thisdeep learning-based imaging approach is capable of recovering a large FOV (~95mm2), high-resolution (~1.7 {\mu}m) image at high speed (within 1 second),while not necessarily introducing any changes to the setup of existingmicroscopes.

High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the  electronic structure of EuFe2As2

  We report the high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopystudies of electronic structure of EuFe2As2. The paramagnetic state data arefound to be consistent with density-functional calculations. In theantiferromagnetic ordering state of Fe, our results show that the bandsplitting, folding, and hybridization evolve with temperature, which cannot beexplained by a simple folding picture. Detailed measurements reveal that a tinyelectron Fermi pocket and a tiny hole pocket are formed near (pi,pi) in the(0,0)-(pi,pi) direction, which qualitatively agree with the results of quantumoscillations, considering kz variation of Fermi surface. Furthermore, nonoticeable change within the energy resolution is observed across theantiferromagnetic transition of Eu2+ ordering, suggesting weak coupling betweenEu sublattice and FeAs sublattice.

Dirac-Point Solitons in Nonlinear Optical Lattices

  The discovery of a new type of solitons occuring in periodic systems withoutphotonic bandgaps is reported. Solitons are nonlinear self-trapped wavepackets. They have been extensively studied in many branches of physics.Solitons in periodic systems, which have become the mainstream of solitonresearch in the past decade, are localized states supported by photonicbandgaps. In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new type of solitonslocated at the Dirac point beyond photonic bandgaps. The Dirac point is aconical singularity of a photonic band structure where wave motion obeys thefamous Dirac equation. These new solitons are sustained by the Dirac pointrather than photonic bandgaps, thus provides a sort of advance in conceptualunderstanding over the traditional gap solitons. Apart from their theoreticalimpact within soliton theory, they have many potential uses because suchsolitons have dramatic stability characteristics and are possible in both Kerrmaterial and photorefractive crystals that possess self-focusing andself-defocusing nonlinearities. The new results elegantly reveal thattraditional photonic bandgaps are not required when Dirac points areaccessible. The findings enrich the soliton family and provide valuableinformation for studies of nonlinear waves in many branches of physics,including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and Bose Einstein condensates.

Pion-induced production of the $Z_c(3900)$ off a nuclear target

  We investigate the possibility to study the charmoniumlike state $Z_c(3900)$through the pion-induced production off a nuclear target. By using ahigh-energy pion beam, the $Z_c(3900)$ can be produced off a proton or nucleusthough the Primakoff effect. The production amplitude is calculated in aneffective Lagrangian approach combined with the vector dominance model. Thetotal cross sections of the $p(\pi^-, Z^-_c(3900))$ and $p(\pi^-,Z^-_c(3900)\to J/\psi\pi^-)$ reactions are calculated, and their order ofmagnitude is about 0.1 and 0.01nb, respectively, with an assumption of branchratio 10\% for the $Z_c(3900)$ decay in $J/\psi\pi$ channel. If the protontarget is replaced by a nuclear target, the production of the $Z_c(3900)$enhances obviously. The predicted total cross sections for the $A(\pi^-,Z^-_c(3900))$ and $A(\pi^-, Z^-_c(3900)\to J/\psi\pi^-)$ reactions with$A=^{12}$C or $^{208}$Pb are on the order of magnitude of 100 and 10 nb,respectively, which is about one thousand times larger than the cross sectionsoff a proton target. Based on these the results, we suggest the experimentalstudy of the $Z_c(3900)$ by using high-energy pion beams with a nuclear targetat facilities such as COMPASS and J-PARC.

Electronic structure of FeS

  Here we report the electronic structure of FeS, a recently identifiediron-based superconductor. Our high-resolution angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy studies show two hole-like ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) and twoelectron-like ($\eta$ and $\delta$) Fermi pockets around the Brillouin zonecenter and corner, respectively, all of which exhibit moderate dispersion along$k_z$. However, a third hole-like band ($\gamma$) is not observed, which isexpected around the zone center from band calculations and is common iniron-based superconductors. Since this band has the highest renormalizationfactor and is known to be the most vulnerable to defects, its absence in ourdata is likely due to defect scattering --- and yet superconductivity can existwithout coherent quasiparticles in the $\gamma$ band. This may help resolve thecurrent controversy on the superconducting gap structure of FeS. Moreover, bycomparing the $\beta$ bandwidths of various iron chalcogenides, including FeS,FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, FeSe, and FeSe$_{1-x}$ Te$_x$, we find that the $\beta$bandwidth of FeS is the broadest. However, the band renormalization factor ofFeS is still quite large, when compared with the band calculations, whichindicates sizable electron correlations. This explains why the unconventionalsuperconductivity can persist over such a broad range of isovalent substitutionin FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.

Deep Stock Representation Learning: From Candlestick Charts to  Investment Decisions

  We propose a novel investment decision strategy (IDS) based on deep learning.The performance of many IDSs is affected by stock similarity. Most existingstock similarity measurements have the problems: (a) The linear nature of manymeasurements cannot capture nonlinear stock dynamics; (b) The estimation ofmany similarity metrics (e.g. covariance) needs very long period historic data(e.g. 3K days) which cannot represent current market effectively; (c) Theycannot capture translation-invariance. To solve these problems, we applyConvolutional AutoEncoder to learn a stock representation, based on which wepropose a novel portfolio construction strategy by: (i) using the deeplylearned representation and modularity optimisation to cluster stocks andidentify diverse sectors, (ii) picking stocks within each cluster according totheir Sharpe ratio (Sharpe 1994). Overall this strategy provides low-riskhigh-return portfolios. We use the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index(FTSE 100) data for evaluation. Results show our portfolio outperforms FTSE 100index and many well known funds in terms of total return in 2000 trading days.

Data Dwarfs: A Lens Towards Fully Understanding Big Data and AI  Workloads

  The complexity and diversity of big data and AI workloads make understandingthem difficult and challenging. This paper proposes a new approach tocharacterizing big data and AI workloads. We consider each big data and AIworkload as a pipeline of one or more classes of unit of computations performedon different initial or intermediate data inputs. Each class of unit ofcomputation captures the common requirements while being reasonably divorcedfrom individual implementations, and hence we call it a data dwarf. For thefirst time, among a wide variety of big data and AI workloads, we identifyeight data dwarfs that takes up most of run time, including Matrix, Sampling,Logic, Transform, Set, Graph, Sort and Statistic. We implement the eight datadwarfs on different software stacks as the micro benchmarks of an open-sourcebig data and AI benchmark suite, and perform comprehensive characterization ofthose data dwarfs from perspective of data sizes, types, sources, and patternsas a lens towards fully understanding big data and AI workloads.

Investigating Generative Adversarial Networks based Speech  Dereverberation for Robust Speech Recognition

  We investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in speechdereverberation for robust speech recognition. GANs have been recently studiedfor speech enhancement to remove additive noises, but there still lacks of awork to examine their ability in speech dereverberation and the advantages ofusing GANs have not been fully established. In this paper, we provide deepinvestigations in the use of GAN-based dereverberation front-end in ASR. First,we study the effectiveness of different dereverberation networks (the generatorin GAN) and find that LSTM leads a significant improvement as compared withfeed-forward DNN and CNN in our dataset. Second, further adding residualconnections in the deep LSTMs can boost the performance as well. Finally, wefind that, for the success of GAN, it is important to update the generator andthe discriminator using the same mini-batch data during training. Moreover,using reverberant spectrogram as a condition to discriminator, as suggested inprevious studies, may degrade the performance. In summary, our GAN-baseddereverberation front-end achieves 14%-19% relative CER reduction as comparedto the baseline DNN dereverberation network when tested on a strongmulti-condition training acoustic model.

Doping effects of Cr on the physical properties of  BaFe$_{1.9-x}$Ni$_{0.1}$Cr$_{x}$As$_{2}$

  We present a systematic study on the heavily Cr doped iron pnictidesBaFe$_{1.9-x}$Ni$_{0.1}$Cr$_{x}$As$_{2}$ by using elastic neutron scattering,high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), resistivity and Halltransport measurements. When the Cr concentration increases from $x=$ 0 to 0.8,neutron diffraction experiments suggest that the collinear antiferromagnetismpersists in the whole doping range, where the N\'{e}el temperature $T_N$coincides with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition temperature$T_s$, and both of them keeps around 35 K. The magnetic ordered moment, on theother hand, increases within increasing $x$ until $x=$ 0.5, and then decreaseswith further increasing $x$. Detailed refinement of the powder XRD patternsreveals that the Cr substitutions actually stretch the FeAs$_4$ tetrahedronalong the $c-$axis and lift the arsenic height away Fe-Fe plane. Transportresults indicate that the charge carriers become more localized upon Cr doping,then changes from electron-type to hole-type around $x=$ 0.5. Our resultssuggest that the ordered moment and the ordered temperature of static magnetismin iron pnictides can be decoupled and tuned separately by chemical doping.

Data Motifs: A Lens Towards Fully Understanding Big Data and AI  Workloads

  The complexity and diversity of big data and AI workloads make understandingthem difficult and challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to modellingand characterizing big data and AI workloads. We consider each big data and AIworkload as a pipeline of one or more classes of units of computation performedon different initial or intermediate data inputs. Each class of unit ofcomputation captures the common requirements while being reasonably divorcedfrom individual implementations, and hence we call it a data motif. For thefirst time, among a wide variety of big data and AI workloads, we identifyeight data motifs that take up most of the run time of those workloads,including Matrix, Sampling, Logic, Transform, Set, Graph, Sort and Statistic.We implement the eight data motifs on different software stacks as the microbenchmarks of an open-source big data and AI benchmark suite ---BigDataBench4.0 (publicly available from http://prof.ict.ac.cn/BigDataBench), and performcomprehensive characterization of those data motifs from perspective of datasizes, types, sources, and patterns as a lens towards fully understanding bigdata and AI workloads. We believe the eight data motifs are promisingabstractions and tools for not only big data and AI benchmarking, but alsodomain-specific hardware and software co-design.
