Opportunities in Flavour Physics at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC

  Motivated by the success of the flavour physics programme carried out overthe last decade at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we characterize in detailthe physics potential of its High-Luminosity and High-Energy upgrades in thisdomain of physics. We document the extraordinary breadth of the HL/HE-LHCprogramme enabled by a putative Upgrade II of the dedicated flavour physicsexperiment LHCb and the evolution of the established flavour physics role ofthe ATLAS and CMS general purpose experiments. We connect the dedicated flavourphysics programme to studies of the top quark, Higgs boson, and directhigh-$p_T$ searches for new particles and force carriers. We discuss thecomplementarity of their discovery potential for physics beyond the StandardModel, affirming the necessity to fully exploit the LHC's flavour physicspotential throughout its upgrade eras.

The radio/gamma-ray connection in Active Galactic Nuclei in the era of  the Fermi Large Area Telescope

  We present a detailed statistical analysis of the correlation between radioand gamma-ray emission of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) detected by Fermiduring its first year of operation, with the largest datasets ever used forthis purpose. We use both archival interferometric 8.4 GHz data (from the VLAand ATCA, for the full sample of 599 sources) and concurrent single-dish 15 GHzmeasurements from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO, for a sub sample of199 objects). Our unprecedentedly large sample permits us to assess with highaccuracy the statistical significance of the correlation, using asurrogate-data method designed to simultaneously account for common-distancebias and the effect of a limited dynamical range in the observed quantities. Wefind that the statistical significance of a positive correlation between the cmradio and the broad band (E>100 MeV) gamma-ray energy flux is very high for thewhole AGN sample, with a probability <1e-7 for the correlation appearing bychance. Using the OVRO data, we find that concurrent data improve thesignificance of the correlation from 1.6e-6 to 9.0e-8. Our large sample sizeallows us to study the dependence of correlation strength and significance onspecific source types and gamma-ray energy band. We find that the correlationis very significant (chance probability <1e-7) for both FSRQs and BL Lacsseparately; a dependence of the correlation strength on the consideredgamma-ray energy band is also present, but additional data will be necessary toconstrain its significance.

Observation of a resonance in $B^+ \to K^+ μ^+μ^-$ decays at low  recoil

  A broad peaking structure is observed in the dimuon spectrum of $B^+ \to K^+\mu^+\mu^-$ decays in the kinematic region where the kaon has a low recoilagainst the dimuon system. The structure is consistent with interferencebetween the $B^+ \to K^+ \mu^+\mu^-$ decay and a resonance and has astatistical significance exceeding six standard deviations. The mean and widthof the resonance are measured to be $4191^{+9}_{-8}\mathrm{\,Me\kern -0.1emV/}c^2$ and $65^{+22}_{-16}\mathrm{\,Me\kern -0.1em V/}c^2$, respectively,where the uncertainties include statistical and systematic contributions. Thesemeasurements are compatible with the properties of the $\psi(4160)$ meson.First observations of both the decay $B^+ \to \psi(4160) K^+$ and thesubsequent decay $\psi(4160) \to \mu^+\mu^-$ are reported. The resonant decayand the interference contribution make up 20\,% of the yield in the low recoilregion, which is larger than theoretical estimates.

Search for the doubly charmed baryon Xi_cc^+

  A search for the doubly charmed baryon Xi_cc^+ in the decay mode Xi_cc^+ ->Lambda_c^+ K^- pi^+ is performed with a data sample, corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 0.65/fb, of pp collisions recorded at a centre-of-massenergy of 7 TeV. No significant signal is found in the mass range 3300-3800MeV/c^2. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the ratio of the Xi_cc^+production cross-section times branching fraction to that of the Lambda_c^+, R,are given as a function of the Xi_cc^+ mass and lifetime. The largest upperlimits range from R < 1.5 x 10^-2 for a lifetime of 100 fs to R < 3.9 x 10^-4for a lifetime of 400 fs.

Measurement of $b$-hadron branching fractions for two-body decays into  charmless charged hadrons

  Based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.37 fb^-1collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011, the following ratios of branchingfractions are measured:  B(B0 -> pi+ pi-) / B(B0 -> K+pi-) = 0.262 +/- 0.009 +/- 0.017,  (fs/fd) * B(Bs -> K+K-) / B(B^0 -> K+pi-) = 0.316 +/- 0.009 +/- 0.019,  (fs/fd) * B(Bs ->pi+ K-) / B(B0 -> K+pi-) = 0.074 +/- 0.006 +/- 0.006,  (fd/fs) * B(B0 -> K+K-) / B(Bs -> K+K-) = 0.018 {+ 0.008 - 0.007} +/- 0.009,  (fs/fd) * B(Bs -> pi+pi-) / B(B0 -> pi+pi-) = 0.050 {+ 0.011 - 0.009} +/-0.004,  B(Lambda_b -> p pi-) / B(Lambda_b -> p K-) = 0.86 +/- 0.08 +/- 0.05, wherethe first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. Using thecurrent world average of B(B0 -> K+pi-) and the ratio of the strange to lightneutral B meson production fs/fd measured by LHCb, we obtain:  B(B0 -> pi+pi-) = (5.08 +/- 0.17 +/- 0.37) x 10^-6,  B(Bs -> K+K-) = (23.0 +/- 0.7 +/- 2.3) x 10^-6,  B(Bs -> pi+K-) = (5.4 +/- 0.4 +/- 0.6) x 10^-6,  B(B0 -> K+K-) = (0.11 {+ 0.05 - 0.04} +/- 0.06) x 10^-6,  B(Bs -> pi+pi-) = (0.95 {+ 0.21 - 0.17} +/- 0.13) x 10^-6.  The measurements of B(Bs -> K+K-), B(Bs -> pi+ K-) and B(B0 -> K+K-) are themost precise to date. The decay mode Bs -> pi+pi- is observed for the firsttime with a significance of more than 5 sigma.

Search for the decay D0 to π+ π- μ+ μ-

  A search for the D0 to \pi+ \pi- \mu+ \mu- decay, where the muon pair doesnot originate from a resonance, is performed using proton-proton collision datacorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb-1 recorded by the LHCbexperiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. No signal is observed and anupper limit on the relative branching fraction with respect to the resonantdecay mode D0 to \pi+ \pi- \phi(to \mu+ \mu-), under the assumption of aphase-space model, is found to be B(D0 to \pi+ \pi- mu+ mu-)/B(D0 to \pi+ \pi-\phi(to \mu+ \mu-)) < 0.96 at the 90% confidence level. The upper limit on theabsolute branching fraction is evaluated to be B(D0 to \pi+ \pi- \mu+ \mu-) <5.5 x 10-7 at 90% confidence level. This is the most stringent to date.

Measurement of b hadron production fractions in 7 TeV pp collisions

  Measurements of $b$ hadron production ratios in proton-proton collisions at acentre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 3 pb$^{-1}$ arepresented. We study the ratios of strange $B$ meson to light $B$ mesonproduction $f_s/(f_u+f_d)$ and $\Lambda_b^0$ baryon to light $B$ mesonproduction $f_{\Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d)$ as a function of the charmed hadron-muonpair transverse momentum $p_T$ and the $b$ hadron pseudorapidity $\eta$, for$p_T$ between 0 and 14 GeV and $\eta$ between 2 and 5. We find that$f_s/(f_u+f_d)$ is consistent with being independent of $p_{\rm T}$ and $\eta$,and we determine $f_s/(f_u+f_d)$ = 0.134$\pm$ 0.004 $^{+0.011}_{-0.010}$, wherethe first error is statistical and the second systematic. The correspondingratio $f_{\Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d)$ is found to be dependent upon the transversemomentum of the charmed hadron-muon pair, $f_{\Lambda_b}/(f_u+f_d)=(0.404\pm0.017 (stat) \pm 0.027 (syst) \pm 0.105 (Br))\times[1 -(0.031 \pm 0.004 (stat)\pm 0.003 (syst))\times p_T(GeV)]$, where Br reflects an absolute scaleuncertainty due to the poorly known branching fraction Br(\Lambda_c^+ \topK^-\pi^+)$. We extract the ratio of strange $B$ meson to light neutral $B$meson production $f_s/f_d$ by averaging the result reported here with twoprevious measurements derived from the relative abundances of $\bar{B}_s \toD_S^+ \pi ^-$ to $\bar{B}^0 \to D^+K^-$ and $\bar{B}^0 \to D^+\pi^-$. We obtain$f_s/f_d=0.267^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$.

Study of B0 -> D*- pi+ pi- pi+ and B0 -> D*- K+ pi- pi+ decays

  Using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment atsqrt(s) = 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb^{-1}, theratio of branching fractions of the B0 -> D*- pi+ pi- pi+ decay relative to theB0 -> D*- pi+ decay is measured to be B(B0 -> D*- pi+ pi- pi+) / B(B0 -> D*-pi+) = 2.64 \pm 0.04 (stat.) \pm 0.13 (syst.). The Cabibbo-suppressed decay B0-> D*- K+ pi- pi+ is observed for the first time and the measured ratio ofbranching fractions is B(B0 -> D*- K+ pi- pi+) / B(B0 -> D*- pi+ pi- pi+) =(6.47 \pm 0.37 (stat.) \pm 0.35 (syst.)) x 10^{-2}. A search for orbitalexcitations of charm mesons contributing to the B0 -> D*- pi+ pi- pi+ finalstate is also performed, and the first observation of the B0 ->Dbar_{1}(2420)^0 pi+ pi- decay is reported with the ratio of branchingfractions B(B0 -> (Dbar_{1}(2420)^0 -> D*- pi+) pi- pi+) / B(B0 -> D*- pi+ pi-pi+) = (2.04 \pm 0.42 (stat.) \pm 0.22 (syst.)) x 10^{-2}, where the numeratorrepresents a product of the branching fractions B(B0 -> Dbar_{1}(2420)^0 pi-pi+) and B(Dbar_{1}(2420)^0 -> D*- pi+).

First observation of B0->J/ψK+K- and search for B0->J/ψφ\  decays

  The first observation of the B0->J/\psi K+K- decay is presented with a datasample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0/fb of pp collisions ata center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected with the LHCb detector. Thebranching fraction is measured to be B(B0->J/\psi K+K-) = (2.53 +/- 0.31 +/-0.19)x10^{-6}, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second issystematic. An amplitude analysis of the final state in the B0->J/\psi K+K-decay is performed to separate resonant and nonresonant contributions in theK+K- spectrum. Evidence of the a0(980) resonance is reported with statisticalsignificance of 3.9 standard deviations. The corresponding product branchingfraction is measured to be B(B0->J/\psi a0(980), a0(980)->K+K-)=(4.70 +/- 3.31+/- 0.72)x10^{-7}, yielding an upper limit of B(B0->J/\psi a0(980),a0(980)->K+K-)<9.0x10^{-7} at 90% confidence level. No evidence of the resonantdecay B0->J/\psi\phi\; is found, and an upper limit on its branching fractionis set to be B(B0->J/\psi\phi)< 1.9x10^{-7} at 90% confidence level.

Measurements of the Branching fractions for $B_(s) -> D_(s)πππ$  and $Λ_b^0 -> Λ_c^+πππ$

  Branching fractions of the decays $H_b\to H_c\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ relative to$H_b\to H_c\pi^-$ are presented, where $H_b$ ($H_c$) represents B^0-bar($D^+$),$B^-$ ($D^0$), B_s^0-bar ($D_s^+$) and $\Lambda_b^0$ ($\Lambda_c^+$). Themeasurements are performed with the LHCb detector using 35${\rm pb^{-1}}$ ofdata collected at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV. The ratios of branching fractions aremeasured to be  B(B^0-bar -> D^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-)/ B(B^0-bar -> D^+\pi^-) = 2.38\pm0.11\pm0.21  B(B^- -> D^0\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-) / B(B^- -> D^0\pi^-) = 1.27\pm0.06\pm0.11  B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-) / B(B_s^0-bar -> D_s^+\pi^-) =2.01\pm0.37\pm0.20  B(\Lambda_b^0->\Lambda_c^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-) / B(\Lambda_b^0 ->\Lambda_c^+\pi^-) = 1.43\pm0.16\pm0.13.  We also report measurements of partial decay rates of these decays to excitedcharm hadrons. These results are of comparable or higher precision thanexisting measurements.

Measurement of psi(2S) meson production in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7  TeV

  The differential cross-section for the inclusive production of psi(2S) mesonsin pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV has been measured with the LHCb detector. Thedata sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb-1. The psi(2S)mesons are reconstructed in the decay channels psi(2S) -> mu+ mu- and psi(2S)-> J/psi pi+ pi-, with the J/psi meson decaying into two muons. Results arepresented both for promptly produced psi(2S) mesons and for those originatingfrom b-hadron decays. In the kinematic range pT(psi(2S)) <= 16 GeV/c and 2 <y(psi(2S)) <= 4.5 we measure 1.44 +- 0.01 +- 0.12+0.2-0.4 mub for promptpsi(2S) production and 0.25 +- 0.01 +- 0.02 mub for psi(2S) from b-hadrondecays, where the last uncertainty on the prompt cross-section is due to theunknown psi(2S) polarization. Recent QCD calculations are found to be in goodagreement with our measurements. Combining the present result with the LHCbJ/psi measurements we determine the inclusive branching fraction B(b -> psi(2S)X) = (2.73 +- 0.06 +- 0.16 +- 0.24) x 10^(-3), where the last uncertainty isdue to the B(b -> J/psi X), B(J/psi -> mu+ mu-) and B(psi(2S) -> e+ e-)branching fraction uncertainties.

Precision measurement of the Lambda_b baryon lifetime

  The ratio of the \Lambda b baryon lifetime to that of the B0 meson ismeasured using 1.0/fb of integrated luminosity in 7 TeV center-of-mass energypp collisions at the LHC. The \Lambda b baryon is observed for the first timein the decay mode \Lambda b -> J/\psi pK-, while the B0 meson decay used is thewell known B0 -> J/\psi pi+K- mode, where the pi+ K- mass is consistent withthat of the K*0(892) meson. The ratio of lifetimes is measured to be 0.976 +/-0.012 +/- 0.006, in agreement with theoretical expectations based on the heavyquark expansion. Using previous determinations of the B0 meson lifetime, the\Lambda b lifetime is found to be 1.482 +/- 0.018 +/- 0.012 ps. In both casesthe first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.

Observation of the decay Bc+ -> Bs0 pi+

  The result of a search for the decay Bc+ -> Bs0 pi+ is presented, using theBs0 -> Ds- pi+ and Bs0 -> J/psi Phi channels. The analysis is based on a datasample of pp collisions collected with the LHCb detector, corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 1 fb-1 taken at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and2 fb-1 taken at 8 TeV. The decay Bc+ -> Bs0 pi+ is observed with significancein excess of five standard deviations independently in both decay channels. Themeasured product of the ratio of cross-sections and branching fraction issigma(Bc+)/sigma(Bs0) x BR(Bc+ -> Bs0 pi+) = (2.37 \pm 0.31 (stat) \pm 0.11(syst)^{+0.17}_{-0.13} (tau_Bc)) x 10^-3 in the pseudorapidity range 2 < eta(B)< 5, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic andthe third is due to the uncertainty on the Bc lifetime. This is the firstobservation of a B meson decaying to another B meson via the weak interaction.

Study of $J/ψ$ production and cold nuclear matter effects in $p$Pb  collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5 \mathrm{TeV}$

  The production of $J/\psi$ mesons with rapidity $1.5<y<4.0$ or $-5.0<y<-2.5$and transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}<14 \mathrm{GeV}/c$ is studied with theLHCb detector in proton-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-massenergy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5 \mathrm{TeV}$. The analysis is based on a data samplecorresponding to an integrated luminosity of about $1.6 \mathrm{nb}^{-1}$. Forthe first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward productionratio are determined separately for prompt $J/\psi$ mesons and $J/\psi$ from$b$-hadron decays. Clear suppression of prompt $J/\psi$ production with respectto proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the productionof $J/\psi$ from $b$-hadron decays is less suppressed. These results show goodagreement with available theoretical predictions. The measurement shows thatcold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the relatedquark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.

Measurement of the isospin asymmetry in $B \to K^{(*)}μ^+μ^-$ decays

  The isospin asymmetries of $B \to K^{(*)}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays and the partialbranching fractions of $B^0 \to K^0\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^+ \to K^{*+}\mu^+\mu^-$are measured as a function of the di-muon mass squared $q^2$ using anintegrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb detector. The $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-$ isospin asymmetry integrated over $q^2$ is negative, deviatingfrom zero with over 4 $\sigma$ significance. The $B \to K^{*}\mu^+\mu^-$ decaymeasurements are consistent with the Standard Model prediction of negligibleisospin asymmetry. The observation of the decay $B^0 \toK^0_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle S}\mu^+\mu^-$ is reported with 5.7 $\sigma$significance. Assuming that the branching fraction of $B^0 \to K^0\mu^+\mu^-$is twice that of $B^0 \to K^0_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle S}\mu^+\mu^-$, thebranching fractions of $B^0 \to K^0\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B \to K^{*+}\mu^+\mu^-$ arefound to be ($0.31^{+0.07}_{-0.06}) \times 10^{-6}$ and ($1.16\pm0.19) \times10^{-6}$, respectively.

Measurement of the CP-violating phase $φ_s$ in  $\overline{B}^0_s\rightarrow J/ψπ^+π^-$ decays

  The mixing-induced CP-violating phase $\phi_s$ in ${B}^0_s$ and$\overline{B}^0_s$ decays is measured using the $J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ final statein data, taken from 3\,fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, collected with theLHCb detector in 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass $pp$ collisions at the LHC. Atime-dependent flavour-tagged amplitude analysis, allowing for direct \CPviolation, yields a value for the phase $\phi_s=70\pm 68\pm 8$\,mrad. Thisresult is consistent with the Standard Model expectation and previousmeasurements.

Precision measurement of the ratio of the $Λ^0_b$ to  $\overline{B}^0$ lifetimes

  The LHCb measurement of the lifetime ratio of the $\Lambda^0_b$ to the$\overline{B}^0$ meson is updated using data corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected using 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy$pp$ collisions at the LHC. The decay modes used are $\overline{B}^0\to J/\psip K^-$ and $\overline{B}^0\to J/\psi \pi^+ K^-$, where the $\pi^+K^-$ mass isconsistent with that of the $\overline{K}^{*0}(892)$ meson. The lifetime ratiois determined with unprecedented precision to be $0.974\pm0.006\pm0.004$, wherethe first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This result isin agreement with original theoretical predictions based on the heavy quarkexpansion. Using the current world average of the $\overline{B}^0$ lifetime,the $\Lambda^0_b$ lifetime is found to be $1.479 \pm 0.009 \pm 0.010$ ps.

Measurement of the ratio of $B_c^+$ branching fractions to $J/ψπ^+$  and $J/ψμ^+ν_μ$

  The first measurement that relates semileptonic and hadronic decay rates ofthe $B_c^+$ meson is performed using proton-proton collision data correspondingto 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with the LHCb detector. Themeasured value of the ratio of branching fractions, ${\cal B}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi\pi^+)/{\cal B}(B_c^+\to J/\psi\mu^+\nu_\mu)=0.0469 \pm 0.0028 (stat.) \pm0.0046 (syst.)$, is at the lower end of available theoretical predictions.

Measurement of the track reconstruction efficiency at LHCb

  The determination of track reconstruction efficiencies at LHCb using$J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays is presented. Efficiencies above$95\%$ are found for the data taking periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The ratioof the track reconstruction efficiency of muons in data and simulation iscompatible with unity and measured with an uncertainty of $0.8\,\%$ for datataking in 2010, and at a precision of $0.4\,\%$ for data taking in 2011 and2012. For hadrons an additional $1.4\,\%$ uncertainty due to materialinteractions is assumed. This result is crucial for accurate cross section andbranching fraction measurements in LHCb.

Measurement of the effective $B_s^0 \rightarrow K^+ K^-$ lifetime

  A precise determination of the effective $B_s^0 \rightarrow K^+ K^-$ lifetimecan be used to constrain contributions from physics beyond the Standard Modelin the $B_s^0$ meson system. Conventional approaches select $B$ meson decayproducts that are significantly displaced from the $B$ meson production vertex.As a consequence, $B$ mesons with low decay times are suppressed, introducing abias to the decay time spectrum which must be corrected. This analysis uses atechnique that explicitly avoids a lifetime bias by using a neural networkbased trigger and event selection. Using 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded by theLHCb experiment, the effective $B_s^0 \rightarrow K^+ K^-$ lifetime is measuredas $1.455 \pm 0.046 \; \mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.006 \; \mathrm{(syst.)} \,\mathrm{ps}.$

  Searches for the lepton flavour violating decay $\tau^-\rightarrow\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and the lepton flavour and baryon number violating decays$\tau^-\rightarrow \bar{p}\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\tau^-\rightarrow p\mu^-\mu^-$ havebeen carried out using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$, taken by the LHCb experiment at$\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. No evidence has been found for any signal, and limits havebeen set at 90% confidence level on the branching fractions: $\calB(\tau^-\rightarrow \mu^-\mu^+\mu^-) < 8.0 \times 10^{-8}$, $\calB(\tau^-\rightarrow \bar{p}\mu^+\mu^-) < 3.3 \times 10^{-7}$ and $\calB(\tau^-\rightarrow p\mu^-\mu^-) < 4.4 \times 10^{-7}$. The results for the$\tau^-\rightarrow \bar{p}\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\tau^-\rightarrow p\mu^-\mu^-$ decaymodes represent the first direct experimental limits on these channels.

Search for D+(s) to pi+ mu+ mu- and D+(s) to pi- mu+ mu+ decays

  A search for non-resonant D+(s) to pi+mu+mu- and D+(s) to pi-mu+mu+ decays isperformed using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 1.0 fb-1, at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV recorded by the LHCb experiment in2011. No signals are observed and the 90% (95%) confidence level (CL) limits onthe branching fractions are  B(D+ to pi+mu+mu-) < 7.3 (8.3) x 10-8,  B(Ds+ to pi+mu+mu-) < 4.1 (4.8) x 10-7,  B(D+ to pi-mu+mu+) < 2.2 (2.5) x 10-8,  B(Ds+ to pi-mu+mu+) < 1.2 (1.4) x 10-7.  These limits are the most stringent to date.

Observation of the resonant character of the $Z(4430)^-$ state

  Resonant structures in $B^0\to\psi'\pi^-K^+$ decays are analyzed byperforming a four-dimensional fit of the decay amplitude, using $pp$ collisiondata corresponding to $\rm 3 fb^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb detector. Thedata cannot be described with $K^+\pi^-$ resonances alone, which is confirmedwith a model-independent approach. A highly significant$Z(4430)^-\to\psi'\pi^-$ component is required, thus confirming the existenceof this state. The observed evolution of the $Z(4430)^-$ amplitude with the$\psi'\pi^-$ mass establishes the resonant nature of this particle. The massand width measurements are substantially improved. The spin-parity isdetermined unambiguously to be $1^+$.

Measurement of the $Ξ_b^-$ and $Ω_b^-$ baryon lifetimes

  Using a data sample of pp collisions corresponding to an integratedluminosity of $3~ \rm fb^{-1}$, the $\Xi_b^-$ and $\Omega_b^-$ baryons arereconstructed in the $\Xi_b^- \rightarrow J/\psi \Xi^-$ and $\Omega_b^-\rightarrow J/\psi \Omega^-$ decay modes and their lifetimes measured to be  $\tau (\Xi_b^-) = 1.55\, ^{+0.10}_{-0.09}~{\rm(stat)} \pm 0.03\,{\rm(syst)}$ps,  $\tau (\Omega_b^-) = 1.54\, ^{+0.26}_{-0.21}~{\rm(stat)} \pm0.05\,{\rm(syst)}$ ps.  These are the most precise determinations to date. Both measurements are ingood agreement with previous experimental results and with theoreticalpredictions.

Measurement of the charge asymmetry in $B^{\pm}\rightarrow φK^{\pm}$  and search for $B^{\pm}\rightarrow φπ^{\pm}$ decays

  The \CP-violating charge asymmetry in $B^{\pm}\rightarrow \phi K^{\pm}$decays is measured in a sample of $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV centre-of-massenergy, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected bythe LHCb experiment. The result is $\mathcal{A}_{CP}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow \phiK^{\pm}) = \rm 0.022\pm 0.021 \pm 0.009$, where the first uncertainty isstatistical and the second systematic. In addition, a search for the$B^{\pm}\rightarrow \phi \pi^{\pm}$ decay mode is performed, using the$B^{\pm}\rightarrow \phi K^{\pm}$ decay rate for normalization. An upper limiton the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow \phi \pi^{\pm})<1.5\times 10^{-7}$ is set at 90% confidence level.

Search for CP violation in the decay $D^+ \to π^-π^+π^+$

  A search for CP violation in the phase space of the decay$D^+\to\pi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ is reported using $pp$ collision data, corresponding toan integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment ata centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The Dalitz plot distributions for $3.1\times10^6$ $D^+$ and $D^-$ candidates are compared with binned and unbinnedmodel-independent techniques. No evidence for CP violation is found.

A study of CP violation in $B^\pm \to D K^\pm$ and $B^\pm \to D π^\pm$  decays with $D \to K^0_{\rm S} K^\pm π^\mp$ final states

  A first study of CP violation in the decay modes $B^\pm\to [K^0_{\rm S} K^\pm\pi^\mp]_D h^\pm$ and $B^\pm\to [K^0_{\rm S} K^\mp \pi^\pm]_D h^\pm$, where $h$labels a $K$ or $\pi$ meson and $D$ labels a $D^0$ or $\overline{D}^0$ meson,is performed. The analysis uses the LHCb data set collected in $pp$ collisions,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The analysis issensitive to the CP-violating CKM phase $\gamma$ through seven observables: onecharge asymmetry in each of the four modes and three ratios of thecharge-integrated yields. The results are consistent with measurements of$\gamma$ using other decay modes.

Measurement of resonant and $CP$ components in  $\overline{B}_s^0\rightarrow J/ψπ^+π^-$ decays

  The resonant structure of the decay $\overline{B}_s^0\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ isstudied using data corresponding to 3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity from$pp$ collisions by the LHC and collected by the LHCb detector. Five interfering$\pi^+\pi^-$ states are required to describe the decay:$f_0(980),f_0(1500),f_0(1790),f_2(1270)$, and $f_2^{\prime}(1525)$. Analternative model including these states and a non-resonant $J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$component also provides a good description of the data. Based on the differenttransversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the finalstate is found to be compatible with being entirely $CP$-odd. The $CP$-evenpart is found to be $<2.3$% at 95% confidence level. The $f_0(500)$ state isnot observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixingangle with the $f_0(980)$ of $<7.7^{\circ}$ at 90% confidence level, consistentwith a tetraquark interpretation of the $f_0(980)$ substructure.

Measurement of the flavour-specific CP-violating asymmetry $a_{\rm  sl}^s$ in $B_s^0$ decays

  The CP-violating asymmetry a_{sl}^s is studied using semileptonic decays ofBs and anti-Bs mesons produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7TeV at the LHC, exploiting a data sample corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 1.0/fb. The reconstructed final states are Ds^(+/-)\mu ^(-/+),with the Ds^(+/-) particle decaying in the \phi\pi^(+/-) mode. The Ds^(+/-)\mu^{-/+) yields are summed over Bs and anti-Bs initial states, and integratedwith respect to decay time. Data-driven methods are used to measure efficiencyratios. We obtain $a_{sl}^s$ = (-0.06 +/- 0.50 +/- 0.36)%, where the firstuncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.

Observation of $B^0_s$-$\bar{B}^0_s$ mixing and measurement of mixing  frequencies using semileptonic B decays

  The $B^0_s$ and $B^0$ mixing frequencies, $\Delta m_s$ and $\Delta m_d$, aremeasured using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0fb^{-1} collected by the LHCb experiment in $pp$ collisions at a centre of massenergy of 7 TeV during 2011. Around 1.8x10^6 candidate events are selected ofthe type $B^0_{(s)} \to D^-_{(s)} \mu^+$ (+ anything), where about half arefrom peaking and combinatorial backgrounds. To determine the B decay times, acorrection is required for the momentum carried by missing particles, which isperformed using a simulation-based statistical method. Associated production ofmuons or mesons allows us to tag the initial-state flavour and so to resolveoscillations due to mixing. We obtain \Delta m_s = (17.93 \pm 0.22 (stat) \pm0.15 (syst)) ps^{-1}, \Delta m_d = (0.503 \pm 0.011 (stat) \pm 0.013 (syst))ps^{-1}. The hypothesis of no oscillations is rejected by the equivalent of 5.8standard deviations for $B^0_s$ and 13.0 standard deviations for $B^0$. This isthe first observation of $B^0_s$ mixing to be made using only semileptonicdecays.

  Evidence is presented for the decay $B_c+\rightarrow J/\psi 3\pi^+2\pi^-$using proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosityof 3fb$^{-1}$, collected with the LHCb detector. A signal yield of $32\pm8$decays is found with a significance of 4.5 standard deviations. The ratio ofthe branching fraction of the $B_c^+\rightarrow J/\psi 3\pi^+ 2\pi^-$ decay tothat of the $B_c^+ \rightarrow J/\psi \pi^+$ decay is measured to be $$\frac{Br (B_c^+ \rightarrow J/\psi 3\pi^+2\pi^)}{Br (B_c^+ \rightarrow J/\psi\pi^+)} = 1.74\pm0.44\pm0.24, $$ where the first uncertainty is statistical andthe second is systematic.

Studies of beauty baryon decays to $D^0 p h^-$ and $Λ_c^+ h^-$  final states

  Decays of beauty baryons to the $D^0 p h^-$ and $\Lambda_c^+ h^-$ finalstates (where $h$ indicates a pion or a kaon) are studied using a data sampleof $pp$ collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$,collected by the LHCb detector.

The$\bar{B}_s^0$ lifetime is also measured using the flavor-specific$\bar{B}_s^0\to D^-D_s^+$ decay to be $1.52\pm0.15\pm0.01 {\rm ps}$.

The measurements agree with next-to-leading orderQCD predictions as well as with models that include saturation effects.

Search for Majorana neutrinos in $B^- \to π^+μ^-μ^-$ decays

  A search for heavy Majorana neutrinos produced in the $B^- \to\pi^+\mu^-\mu^-$ decay mode is performed using 3 fb$^{-1}$ of integratedluminosity collected with the LHCb detector in $pp$ collisions atcenter-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV at the LHC. Neutrinos with masses inthe range 250-5000 MeV and lifetimes from zero to 1000 ps are probed. In theabsence of a signal, upper limits are set on the branching fraction${\cal{B}}(B^- \to \pi^+\mu^-\mu^-)$ as functions of neutrino mass andlifetime. These limits are on the order of $10^{-9}$ for short neutrinolifetimes of 1 ps or less. Limits are also set on the coupling between the muonand a possible fourth-generation neutrino.

  Measurements of charm mixing parameters from the decay-time-dependent ratioof D0->K+pi- to D0->K-pi+ rates and the charge-conjugate ratio are reported.The analysis uses data, corresponding to 3 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity,from proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV center-of-mass energies recordedby the LHCb experiment. In the limit of charge-parity (CP) symmetry, the mixingparameters are determined to be x'^2=(5.5 +- 4.9)x10^{-5}, y'= (4.8 +-1.0)x10^{-3}, and R_D=(3.568 +- 0.066)x10^{-3}. Allowing for CP violation, themixing parameters are determined separately for D0 and D0bar mesons yieldingA_D = (-0.7 +- 1.9)%, for the direct CP-violating asymmetry, and 0.75 < |q/p|<1.24 at the 68.3% confidence level, where q and p are parameters that describethe mass eigenstates of the neutral charm mesons in terms of the flavoreigenstates. This is the most precise determination of these parameters from asingle experiment and shows no evidence for CP violation.

Observation of B^0_(s) -> J/ψf_1(1285) decays and measurement of the  f_1(1285) mixing angle

  Decays of Bs and B0 mesons into J/\psi \pi +\pi -\pi +\pi - final states,produced in pp collisions at the LHC, are investigated using data correspondingto an integrated luminosity of 3/fb collected with the LHCb detector. B^0_(s)-> J\psi f_1(1285) decays are seen for the first time, and the branchingfractions are measured. Using these rates, the f_1(1285) mixing angle betweenstrange and non-strange components of its wave function in the q-qbar structuremodel is determined to be \pm (24.0^{+3.1+0.6}_{-2.6-0.8}) degrees.Implications on the possible tetraquark nature of the f_1(1285) are discussed.

In addition to theinclusive CP asymmetries, larger asymmetries are observed in localized regionsof phase space.

  A study of indirect CP violation in $D^0$ mesons through the determination ofthe parameter $A_\Gamma$ is presented using a data sample of $pp$ collisions,corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected with theLHCb detector and recorded at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC.The parameter $A_\Gamma$ is the asymmetry of the effective lifetimes measuredin decays of $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ mesons to the CP eigenstates $K^-K^+$ and$\pi^-\pi^+$. Fits to the data sample yield$A_\Gamma(KK)=(-0.35\pm0.62\pm0.12)\times 10^{-3}$ and$A_\Gamma(\pi\pi)=(0.33\pm1.06\pm0.14)\times 10^{-3}$, where the firstuncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. The results representthe world's best measurements of these quantities. They show no difference in$A_\Gamma$ between the two final states and no indication of CP violation.

  A measurement of the $Z(\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-)$+jet production cross-sectionin $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is presented.The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of $1.0\,\text{fb}^{-1}$recorded by the LHCb experiment. Results are shown with two jet transversemomentum thresholds, 10 and 20 GeV, for both the overall cross-section withinthe fiducial volume, and for six differential cross-section measurements. Thefiducial volume requires that both the jet and the muons from the Z boson decayare produced in the forward direction ($2.0<\eta<4.5$). The results show goodagreement with theoretical predictions at the second-order expansion in thecoupling of the strong interaction.

The analysisis performed using a dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment in pp collisions at acentre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The following ratios of branching fractions aremeasured: \begin{equation*} \begin{array}{lll}\dfrac{\cal{B}(B^0_s\rightarrow\chi_{c1}\phi)}{\cal{B}(B^0_s\rightarrowJ/\psi\phi)} &=& (18.9 \pm1.8\,(stat)\pm1.3\,(syst)\pm0.8\,(\cal{B})) \times10^{-2}, \nonumber \\ \noalign{\vskip 3pt}\dfrac{\cal{B}(B^0\rightarrow\chi_{c1}K^{*0})}{\cal{B}(B^0\rightarrowJ/\psiK^{*0})} &=& (19.8 \pm1.1\,(stat)\pm1.2\,(syst)\pm0.9\,(\cal{B})) \times10^{-2}, \nonumber \\ \noalign{\vskip 3pt}\dfrac{\cal{B}(B^0\rightarrow\chi_{c2}K^{*0})}{\cal{B}(B^0\rightarrow\chi_{c1}K^{*0})} &=& (17.1 \pm5.0\,(stat)\pm1.7\,(syst)\pm1.1\,(\cal{B})) \times10^{-2}, \nonumber \\ \noalign{\vskip 3pt} \end{array} \end{equation*}\noindent where the third uncertainty is due to the limited knowledge of thebranching fractions of ${\chi_{c}\rightarrow J/\psi \gamma}$ modes.

  The charmless decays $B^{\pm}\to K^{\pm}\pi^+\pi^-$ and $B^{\pm}\toK^{\pm}K^+K^-$ are reconstructed using data, corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 1.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected by LHCb in 2011. The inclusive chargeasymmetries of these modes are measured as $A_{C\!P}(B^{\pm}\toK^{\pm}\pi^+\pi^-) = 0.032 \pm 0.008 \stat \pm 0.004 \syst \pm 0.007 (J\psiK^{\pm})$ and $A_{C\!P}(B^{\pm}\to K^{\pm}K^+K^-) = -0.043 \pm 0.009 \stat \pm0.003 \syst \pm 0.007 (J\psi K^{\pm})$, where the third uncertainty is due tothe $C\!P$ asymmetry of the $B^{\pm}\to J\psi K^{\pm}$ reference mode. Thesignificance of $A_{C\!P}(B^{\pm}\to K^{\pm}K^+K^-)$ exceeds three standarddeviations and is the first evidence of an inclusive $C\!P$ asymmetry incharmless three-body $B$ decays. In addition to the inclusive $C\!P$asymmetries, larger asymmetries are observed in localised regions of phasespace.

  Dynamics and direct $C\P$ violation in three-body charmless decays of charged$B$ mesons to a proton, an antiproton and a light meson (pion or kaon) arestudied using data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0${\,fb}^{-1}$, collected by the ${LHCb}$ experiment in $pp$ collisions at acenter-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Production spectra are determined as a functionof Dalitz-plot and helicity variables. The forward-backward asymmetry of thelight meson in the $p\bar p$ rest frame is measured. No significant $C\P$asymmetry in $B^+ \to p \bar p K^+$ decay is found in any region of the Dalitzplane. We present the first observation of the decay $B^+ \to \kern0.1em\bar{\kern -0.1em\Lambda}(1520)(\to K^+\bar p)p$ near the $K^+\bar p$threshold and measure $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to \kern 0.1em\bar{\kern-0.1em\Lambda}(1520)p)=(3.9^{+1.0}_{-0.9} (\mathrm{stat})\pm0.1(\mathrm{syst})\pm0.3 (\mathrm{BF}))\times 10^{-7}$, where BF denotes theuncertainty on secondary branching fractions.

The ratio of branching fractions and the direct {\it CP}asymmetries are measured to be $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K_{\rm \scriptscriptstyleS}^0 K^+)/\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle S}^0 \pi^+) = 0.064 \pm0.009\textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.004\textrm{(syst.)}$, $\mathcal{A}^{\it CP}(B^+ \toK_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle S}^0 \pi^+) = -0.022 \pm 0.025\textrm{(stat.)} \pm0.010\textrm{(syst.)}$ and $\mathcal{A}^{\it CP}(B^+ \to K_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle S}^0 K^+) = -0.21 \pm 0.14\textrm{(stat.)} \pm0.01\textrm{(syst.)}$. The data sample taken at $\sqrt{s}=7\mathrm{\,Te\kern-0.1em V}$ is used to search for $B_c^+ \to K_{\rm \scriptscriptstyle S}^0 K^+$decays and results in the upper limit $(f_c\cdot\mathcal{B}(B_c^+ \to K_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle S}^0 K^+))/(f_u\cdot\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle S}^0 \pi^+)) < 5.8\times10^{-2}\textrm{at 90% confidencelevel}$, where $f_c$ and $f_u$ denote the hadronisation fractions of a$\bar{b}$ quark into a $B_c^+$ or a $B^+$ meson, respectively.

Model-independent search for CP violation in D0 to K-K+pi-pi+ and D0 to  pi-pi+pi+pi- decays

  A search for CP violation in the phase-space structures of D0 and D0bardecays to the final states K-K+pi-pi+ and pi-pi+pi+pi- is presented. The searchis carried out with a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of1.0fb^-1 collected in 2011 by the LHCb experiment in $pp$ collisions at acentre-of-mass energy of 7TeV. For the K-K+pi-pi+ final state, the four-bodyphase space is divided into 32 bins, each bin with approximately 1800 decays.The p-value under the hypothesis of no CP violation is 9.1%, and in no bin is aCP asymmetry greater than 6.5% observed. The phase space of the pi-pi+pi+pi-final state is partitioned into 128 bins, each bin with approximately 2500decays. The $p$-value under the hypothesis of no CP violation is 41%, and in nobin is a CP asymmetry greater than 5.5% observed. All results are consistentwith the hypothesis of no CP violation at the current sensitivity.
