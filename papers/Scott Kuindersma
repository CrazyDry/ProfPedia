An Efficiently Solvable Quadratic Program for Stabilizing Dynamic  Locomotion

  We describe a whole-body dynamic walking controller implemented as a convexquadratic program. The controller solves an optimal control problem using anapproximate value function derived from a simple walking model while respectingthe dynamic, input, and contact constraints of the full robot dynamics. Byexploiting sparsity and temporal structure in the optimization with a customactive-set algorithm, we surpass the performance of the best availableoff-the-shelf solvers and achieve 1kHz control rates for a 34-DOF humanoid. Wedescribe applications to balancing and walking tasks using the simulated Atlasrobot in the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge.

Finding Asteroids Down the Back of the Couch: A Novel Approach to the  Minor Planet Linking Problem

  We present a novel approach to the minor planet linking problem. Ourheliocentric transformation-and-propagation algorithm clusters tracklets atcommon epochs, allowing for the efficient identification of tracklets thatrepresent the same minor planet. This algorithm scales as $O(N log N)$, withthe number of tracklets $N$, a significant advance over standard methods, whichscale as $O(N^3)$. This overcomes one of the primary computational bottlenecksfaced by current and future asteroid surveys. We apply our algorithm to theMinor Planet Center's Isolated Tracklet File, establishing orbits for$\sim41,000$ new minor planets.

Contact-Implicit Optimization of Locomotion Trajectories for a  Quadrupedal Microrobot

  Planning locomotion trajectories for legged microrobots is challengingbecause of their complex morphology, high frequency passive dynamics, anddiscontinuous contact interactions with their environment. Consequently, suchresearch is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As analternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, andcontrolling legged microrobots. We develop a three-dimensional dynamic model ofa 1.5 gram quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees offreedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recentlydeveloped variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method togenerate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and wedemonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-spacecontrollers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequenciesand on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities,including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15% faster than previouslymeasured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute avertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78% of the microrobot's center-of-massheight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-enddemonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on amillimeter-scale legged microrobot.

Effective Locomotion at Multiple Stride Frequencies Using Proprioceptive  Feedback on a Legged Microrobot

  Limitations in actuation, sensing, and computation have forced small leggedrobots to rely on carefully tuned, mechanically mediated leg trajectories foreffective locomotion. Recent advances in manufacturing, however, have enabledthe development of small legged robots capable of operation at multiple stridefrequencies using multi-degree-of-freedom leg trajectories. Proprioceptivesensing and control is key to extending the capabilities of these robots to abroad range of operating conditions. In this work, we leverage concomitantsensing for piezoelectric actuation to develop a computationally efficientframework for estimation and control of leg trajectories on a quadrupedalmicrorobot. We demonstrate accurate position estimation ($<$16%root-mean-square error) and control ($<$16% root-mean-square tracking error)during locomotion across a wide range of stride frequencies (10-50 Hz). Thiscapability enables the exploration of two parametric leg trajectories designedto reduce leg slip and increase locomotion performance (e.g., speed,cost-of-transport, etc.). Using this approach, we demonstrate high performancelocomotion at stride frequencies of (10-30 Hz) where the robot's naturaldynamics result in poor open-loop locomotion. Furthermore, we identify regionsof highly dynamic locomotion, low cost-of-transport (3.33), and minimal legslippage ($<$10%).
