WikiRank: Improving Keyphrase Extraction Based on Background Knowledge

  Keyphrase is an efficient representation of the main idea of documents. Whilebackground knowledge can provide valuable information about documents, they arerarely incorporated in keyphrase extraction methods. In this paper, we proposeWikiRank, an unsupervised method for keyphrase extraction based on thebackground knowledge from Wikipedia. Firstly, we construct a semantic graph forthe document. Then we transform the keyphrase extraction problem into anoptimization problem on the graph. Finally, we get the optimal keyphrase set tobe the output. Our method obtains improvements over other state-of-art modelsby more than 2% in F1-score.

Delay Minimization for NOMA-MEC Offloading

  This paper considers the minimization of the offloading delay fornon-orthogonal multiple access assisted mobile edge computing (NOMA-MEC). Bytransforming the delay minimization problem into a form of fractionalprogramming, two iterative algorithms based on Dinkelbach's method and Newton'smethod are proposed. The optimality of both methods is proved and theirconvergence is compared. Furthermore, criteria for choosing between threepossible modes, namely orthogonal multiple access (OMA), pure NOMA, and hybridNOMA, for MEC offloading are established.

Power Control and Performance Analysis of Outage-Limited Cellular  Network with MUD-SIC and Macro-Diversity

  In this paper, we analyze the uplink goodput (bits/sec/Hz successfullydecoded) and per-user packet outage in a cellular network using multi-userdetection with successive interference cancellation (MUD-SIC). We considernon-ergodic fading channels where microscopic fading channel information is notavailable at the transmitters. As a result, packet outage occurs whenever thedata rate of packet transmissions exceeds the instantaneous mutual informationeven if powerful channel coding is applied for protection. We are interested tostudy the role of macro-diversity (MDiv) between multiple base stations on theMUD-SIC performance where the effect of potential error-propagation during theSIC processing is taken into account. While the jointly optimal power anddecoding order in the MUD-SIC are NP hard problem, we derive a simple on/offpower control and asymptotically optimal decoding order with respect to thetransmit power. Based on the information theoretical framework, we derive theclosed-form expressions on the total system goodput as well as the per-userpacket outage probability. We show that the system goodput does not scale withSNR due to mutual interference in the SIC process and macro-diversity (MDiv)could alleviate the problem and benefit to the system goodput.

Navigating in a sea of repeats in RNA-seq without drowning

  The main challenge in de novo assembly of NGS data is certainly to deal withrepeats that are longer than the reads. This is particularly true for RNA- seqdata, since coverage information cannot be used to flag repeated sequences, ofwhich transposable elements are one of the main examples. Most transcriptomeassemblers are based on de Bruijn graphs and have no clear and explicit modelfor repeats in RNA-seq data, relying instead on heuristics to deal with them.The results of this work are twofold. First, we introduce a formal model forrepre- senting high copy number repeats in RNA-seq data and exploit itsproperties for inferring a combinatorial characteristic of repeat-associatedsubgraphs. We show that the problem of identifying in a de Bruijn graph asubgraph with this charac- teristic is NP-complete. In a second step, we showthat in the specific case of a local assembly of alternative splicing (AS)events, we can implicitly avoid such subgraphs. In particular, we designed andimplemented an algorithm to efficiently identify AS events that are notincluded in repeated regions. Finally, we validate our results using syntheticdata. We also give an indication of the usefulness of our method on real data.

Which Clustering Do You Want? Inducing Your Ideal Clustering with  Minimal Feedback

  While traditional research on text clustering has largely focused on groupingdocuments by topic, it is conceivable that a user may want to cluster documentsalong other dimensions, such as the authors mood, gender, age, or sentiment.Without knowing the users intention, a clustering algorithm will only groupdocuments along the most prominent dimension, which may not be the one the userdesires. To address the problem of clustering documents along the user-desireddimension, previous work has focused on learning a similarity metric from datamanually annotated with the users intention or having a human construct afeature space in an interactive manner during the clustering process. With thegoal of reducing reliance on human knowledge for fine-tuning the similarityfunction or selecting the relevant features required by these approaches, wepropose a novel active clustering algorithm, which allows a user to easilyselect the dimension along which she wants to cluster the documents byinspecting only a small number of words. We demonstrate the viability of ouralgorithm on a variety of commonly-used sentiment datasets.

Chiral Topological Orders in an Optical Raman Lattice

  We find an optical Raman lattice without spin-orbit coupling showing chiraltopological orders for cold atoms. Two incident plane-wave lasers are appliedto generate simultaneously a double-well square lattice and periodic Ramancouplings, the latter of which drive the nearest-neighbor hopping and create astaggered flux pattern across the lattice. Such a minimal setup is can yieldthe quantum anomalous Hall effect in the single particle regime, while in theinteracting regime it achieves the $J_1$-$J_2$-$K$ model with all parameterscontrollable, which supports a chiral spin liquid phase. We further show thatheating in the present optical Raman lattice is reduced by more than one orderof magnitude compared with the conventional laser-assisted tunneling schemes.This suggests that the predicted topological states be well reachable with thecurrent experimental capability.

Narrowing the Modeling Gap: A Cluster-Ranking Approach to Coreference  Resolution

  Traditional learning-based coreference resolvers operate by training themention-pair model for determining whether two mentions are coreferent or not.Though conceptually simple and easy to understand, the mention-pair model islinguistically rather unappealing and lags far behind the heuristic-basedcoreference models proposed in the pre-statistical NLP era in terms ofsophistication. Two independent lines of recent research have attempted toimprove the mention-pair model, one by acquiring the mention-ranking model torank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training theentity-mention model to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferentwith a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreferenceresolution, which combines the strengths of the mention-ranking model and theentity-mention model, and is therefore theoretically more appealing than bothof these models. In addition, we seek to improve cluster rankers via twoextensions: (1) lexicalization and (2) incorporating knowledge of anaphoricityby jointly modeling anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution.Experimental results on the ACE data sets demonstrate the superior performanceof cluster rankers to competing approaches as well as the effectiveness of ourtwo extensions.

Application of Smart Antenna Technologies in Simultaneous Wireless  Information and Power Transfer

  Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a promisingsolution to increase the lifetime of wireless nodes and hence alleviate theenergy bottleneck of energy constrained wireless networks. As an alternative toconventional energy harvesting techniques, SWIPT relies on the use of radiofrequency signals, and is expected to bring some fundamental changes to thedesign of wireless communication networks. This article focuses on theapplication of advanced smart antenna technologies, including multiple-inputmultiple-output and relaying techniques, to SWIPT. These smart antennatechnologies have the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiencyand also the spectral efficiency of SWIPT. Different network topologies withsingle and multiple users are investigated, along with some promising solutionsto achieve a favorable trade-off between system performance and complexity. Adetailed discussion of future research challenges for the design of SWIPTsystems is also provided.

Cross-Layer Optimization of Fast Video Delivery in Cache-Enabled  Relaying Networks

  This paper investigates the cross-layer optimization of fast video deliveryand caching for minimization of the overall video delivery time in a two-hoprelaying network. The half-duplex relay nodes are equipped with both a cacheand a buffer which facilitate joint scheduling of fetching and delivery toexploit the channel diversity for improving the overall delivery performance.The fast delivery control is formulated as a two-stage functional non-convexoptimization problem. By exploiting the underlying convex and quasi-convexstructures, the problem can be solved exactly and efficiently by the developedalgorithm. Simulation results show that significant caching and buffering gainscan be achieved with the proposed framework, which translates into a reductionof the overall video delivery time. Besides, a trade-off between caching andbuffering gains is unveiled.

Digital Waveguide Adiabatic Passage Part 2: Experiment

  Using a femtosecond laser writing technique, we fabricate and characterisethree-waveguide digital adiabatic passage devices, with the central waveguidedigitised into five discrete waveguidelets. Strongly asymmetric behaviour wasobserved, devices operated with high fidelity in the counter-intuitive schemewhile strongly suppressing transmission in the intuitive. The low differentialloss of the digital adiabatic passage designs potentially offers additionalfunctionality for adiabatic passage based devices. These devices operate with ahigh contrast ($>\!90\%$) over a 60nm bandwidth, centered at $\sim 823$nm.

Cache-Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access

  In this paper, we propose a novel joint caching and non-orthogonal multipleaccess (NOMA) scheme to facilitate advanced downlink transmission for nextgeneration cellular networks. In addition to reaping the conventionaladvantages of caching and NOMA transmission, the proposed cache-aided NOMAscheme also exploits cached data for interference cancellation which is notpossible with separate caching and NOMA transmission designs. Furthermore, ascaching can help to reduce the residual interference power, several decodingorders are feasible at the receivers, and these decoding orders can be flexiblyselected for performance optimization. We characterize the achievable rateregion of cache-aided NOMA and investigate its benefits for minimizing the timerequired to complete video file delivery. Our simulation results reveal that,compared to several baseline schemes, the proposed cache-aided NOMA schemesignificantly expands the achievable rate region for downlink transmission,which translates into substantially reduced file delivery times.

Origins of clustered frequency combs in Kerr microresonators

  Recent experiments have demonstrated the generation of widely-spacedparametric sidebands that can evolve into "clustered" optical frequency combsin Kerr microresonators. Here we describe the physics that underpins theformation of such clustered comb states. In particular, we show that thephase-matching required for the initial sideband generation is such that (atleast) one of the sidebands experiences anomalous dispersion, enabling thatsideband to drive frequency comb formation via degenerate and non-degeneratefour-wave mixing. We validate our proposal through a combination ofexperimental observations made in a magnesium-fluoride microresonator andcorresponding numerical simulations. We also investigate the coherenceproperties of the resulting clustered frequency combs. Our findings providevaluable insights on the generation and dynamics of widely-spaced parametricsidebands and clustered frequency combs in Kerr microresonators.

Cause Identification from Aviation Safety Incident Reports via Weakly  Supervised Semantic Lexicon Construction

  The Aviation Safety Reporting System collects voluntarily submitted reportson aviation safety incidents to facilitate research work aiming to reduce suchincidents. To effectively reduce these incidents, it is vital to accuratelyidentify why these incidents occurred. More precisely, given a set of possiblecauses, or shaping factors, this task of cause identification involvesidentifying all and only those shaping factors that are responsible for theincidents described in a report. We investigate two approaches to causeidentification. Both approaches exploit information provided by a semanticlexicon, which is automatically constructed via Thelen and Riloffs Basiliskframework augmented with our linguistic and algorithmic modifications. Thefirst approach labels a report using a simple heuristic, which looks for thewords and phrases acquired during the semantic lexicon learning process in thereport. The second approach recasts cause identification as a textclassification problem, employing supervised and transductive textclassification algorithms to learn models from incident reports labeled withshaping factors and using the models to label unseen reports. Our experimentsshow that both the heuristic-based approach and the learning-based approach(when given sufficient training data) outperform the baseline systemsignificantly.

Cache-Enabled Physical-Layer Security for Video Streaming in Wireless  Networks with Limited Backhaul

  In this paper, we investigate for the first time the benefits of wirelesscaching for the physical layer security (PLS) of wireless networks. Inparticular, a caching scheme enabling power-efficient PLS is proposed forcellular video streaming with constrained backhaul capacity. By sharing videodata across a subset of base stations (BSs) through both caching and backhaulloading, secure cooperative transmission of several BSs is dynamically enabledin accordance with the cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaulcapacity. Thereby, caching reduces the data sharing overhead over thecapacity-constrained backhaul links. More importantly, caching introducesadditional secure degrees of freedom and enables a power-efficient design. Weinvestigate the optimal caching and transmission policies for minimizing thetotal transmit power while providing quality of service (QoS) and guaranteeingsecrecy during video delivery. A two-stage non-convex mixed-integeroptimization problem is formulated, which optimizes the caching policy in anoffline video caching stage and the cooperative transmission policy in anonline video delivery stage. As the problem is NP-hard, suboptimalpolynomial-time algorithms are proposed for low-complexity cache training anddelivery control, respectively. Sufficient optimality conditions, under whichthe proposed schemes attain global optimal solutions, are also provided.Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve low secrecy outageprobability and high power efficiency simultaneously.

Secure Video Streaming in Heterogeneous Small Cell Networks with  Untrusted Cache Helpers

  This paper studies secure video streaming in cache-enabled small cellnetworks, where some of the cache-enabled small cell base stations (BSs)helping in video delivery are untrusted. Unfavorably, caching improves theeavesdropping capability of these untrusted helpers as they may intercept boththe cached and the delivered video files. To address this issue, we proposejoint caching and scalable video coding (SVC) of video files to enable securecooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission and, at the sametime, exploit the cache memory of both the trusted and untrusted BSs forimproving the system performance. Considering imperfect channel stateinformation (CSI) at the transmitters, we formulate a two-timescale non-convexmixed-integer robust optimization problem to minimize the total transmit powerrequired for guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) and secrecy during videostreaming. We develop an iterative algorithm based on a modified generalizedBenders decomposition (GBD) to solve the problem optimally, where the cachingand the cooperative transmission policies are determined via offline(long-timescale) and online (short-timescale) optimization, respectively.Furthermore, inspired by the optimal algorithm, a low-complexity suboptimalalgorithm based on a greedy heuristic is proposed. Simulation results show thatthe proposed schemes achieve significant gains in power efficiency and secrecyperformance compared to several baseline schemes.

Cache-Enabled Physical Layer Security for Video Streaming in  Backhaul-Limited Cellular Networks

  In this paper, we propose a novel wireless caching scheme to enhance thephysical layer security of video streaming in cellular networks with limitedbackhaul capacity. By proactively sharing video data across a subset of basestations (BSs) through both caching and backhaul loading, secure cooperativejoint transmission of several BSs can be dynamically enabled in accordance withthe cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaul capacity. Assumingimperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, we formulate atwo-stage non-convex mixed-integer robust optimization problem for minimizingthe total transmit power while providing quality of service (QoS) andguaranteeing communication secrecy during video delivery, where the caching andthe cooperative transmission policy are optimized in an offline video cachingstage and an online video delivery stage, respectively. Although the formulatedoptimization problem turns out to be NP-hard, low-complexity polynomial-timealgorithms, whose solutions are globally optimal under certain conditions, areproposed for cache training and video delivery control. Caching is shown to bebeneficial as it reduces the data sharing overhead imposed on thecapacity-constrained backhaul links, introduces additional secure degrees offreedom, and enables a power-efficient communication system design. Simulationresults confirm that the proposed caching scheme achieves simultaneously a lowsecrecy outage probability and a high power efficiency. Furthermore, due to theproposed robust optimization, the performance loss caused by imperfect CSIknowledge can be significantly reduced when the cache capacity becomes large.

Cache-Aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: The Two-User Case

  In this paper, we propose a cache-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)scheme for spectrally efficient downlink transmission. The proposed scheme notonly reaps the benefits associated with NOMA and caching, but also exploits thedata cached at the users for interference cancellation. As a consequence,caching can help to reduce the residual interference power, making multipledecoding orders at the users feasible. The resulting flexibility in decodingcan be exploited for improved NOMA detection. We characterize the achievablerate region of cache-aided NOMA and derive the Pareto optimal rate tuplesforming the boundary of the rate region. Moreover, we optimize cache-aided NOMAfor minimization of the time required for completing file delivery. The optimaldecoding order and the optimal transmit power and rate allocation are derivedas functions of the cache status, the file sizes, and the channel conditions.Simulation results confirm that, compared to several baseline schemes, theproposed cache-aided NOMA scheme significantly expands the achievable rateregion and increases the sum rate for downlink transmission, which translatesinto substantially reduced file delivery times.

The High Time Resolution Universe survey XIV: Discovery of 23 pulsars  through GPU-accelerated reprocessing

  We have performed a new search for radio pulsars in archival data of theintermediate and high Galactic latitude parts of the Southern High TimeResolution Universe pulsar survey. This is the first time the entire datasethas been searched for binary pulsars, an achievement enabled by GPU-accelerateddedispersion and periodicity search codes nearly 50 times faster than thepreviously used pipeline. Candidate selection was handled entirely by a MachineLearning algorithm, allowing for the assessment of 17.6 million candidates in afew person-days. We have also introduced an outlier detection algorithm forefficient radio-frequency interference (RFI) mitigation on folded data, a newapproach that enabled the discovery of pulsars previously masked by RFI. Wediscuss implications for future searches, particularly the importance ofexpanding work on RFI mitigation to improve survey completeness. In total wediscovered 23 previously unknown sources, including 6 millisecond pulsars andat least 4 pulsars in binary systems. We also found an elusive but credibleredback candidate that we have yet to confirm.

Octave-spanning tunable parametric oscillation in crystalline Kerr  microresonators

  Parametric nonlinear optical processes allow for the generation of newwavelengths of coherent electromagnetic radiation. Their ability to createradiation that is widely tunable in wavelength is particularly appealing, withapplications ranging from spectroscopy to quantum information processing.Unfortunately, existing tunable parametric sources are marred by deficienciesthat obstruct their widespread adoption. Here we show that ultrahigh-Qcrystalline microresonators made of magnesium fluoride can overcome theselimitations, enabling compact and power-efficient devices capable of generatingclean and widely-tunable sidebands. We consider several different resonatorswith carefully engineered dispersion profiles, achieving hundreds of nanometersof sideband tunability in each device when driven with a standard low-powerlaser at 1550 nm. In addition to direct observations of discrete tunabilityover an entire optical octave from 1083 nm to 2670 nm, we record signatures ofmid-infrared sidebands at almost 4000 nm. The simplicity of the devicesconsidered -- compounded by their remarkable tunability -- paves the way forlow-cost, widely-tunable sources of electromagnetic radiation.

Fundamentals of Wireless Information and Power Transfer: From RF Energy  Harvester Models to Signal and System Designs

  Radio waves carry both energy and information simultaneously. Nevertheless,Radio-Frequency (RF) transmission of these quantities have traditionally beentreated separately. Currently, we are experiencing a paradigm shift in wirelessnetwork design, namely unifying wireless transmission of information and powerso as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiations as well as thenetwork infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. Inthis paper, we review and discuss recent progress on laying the foundations ofthe envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing a signal theory and designfor Wireless Information and Power Transmission (WIPT) and identifying thefundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. Westart with an overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely SimultaneousWireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT),Wirelessly PoweredCommunication Network (WPCN), and Wirelessly Powered Backscatter Communication(WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal andsystem designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model.To that end, we highlight three different energy harvester models, namely onelinear model and two nonlinear models, and show how WIPT designs differ foreach of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics discussedinclude rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiverarchitecture, waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distributionoptimizations, resource allocation, and RF spectrum use. We discuss and checkthe validity of the different energy harvester models and the resulting signaltheory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping andexperimentation. We also point out numerous directions that are promising forfuture research.
