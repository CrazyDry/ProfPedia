Phase space geometry for constrained Lagrangian systems

  We study geometry of the phase space for finite-dimensional dynamical systemswith degenerate Lagrangians. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian constraintformalisms are treated as different local-coordinate pictures of the sameinvariant procedure. The invariant description is given in terms of geometricalobjects associated with the structure of foliation on the phase space.

Universal probability-free prediction

  We construct universal prediction systems in the spirit of Popper'sfalsifiability and Kolmogorov complexity and randomness. These predictionsystems do not depend on any statistical assumptions (but under the IIDassumption they dominate, to within the usual accuracy, conformal prediction).Our constructions give rise to a theory of algorithmic complexity andrandomness of time containing analogues of several notions and results of theclassical theory of Kolmogorov complexity and randomness.

Variational Learning in Mixed-State Dynamic Graphical Models

  Many real-valued stochastic time-series are locally linear (Gassian), butglobally non-linear. For example, the trajectory of a human hand gesture can beviewed as a linear dynamic system driven by a nonlinear dynamic system thatrepresents muscle actions. We present a mixed-state dynamic graphical model inwhich a hidden Markov model drives a linear dynamic system. This combinationallows us to model both the discrete and continuous causes of trajectories suchas human gestures. The number of computations needed for exact inference isexponential in the sequence length, so we derive an approximate variationalinference technique that can also be used to learn the parameters of thediscrete and continuous models. We show how the mixed-state model and thevariational technique can be used to classify human hand gestures made with acomputer mouse.

The Moon turns out to be the perfect object to use the linear elasticity  theory

  The applicability of the linear theory of elasticity to the Moon has beenstudied. As a criterion was taken the smallness of the strain tensor. Theelastic moduli are obtained from the data of the project "Apollo". The pressurewas calculated in the framework of the model of a homogeneous solid sphereunder the action of its own gravity. The strain tensor trace is of the order$0.02$, which indicates the applicability.  The strain tensor in the body of the Moon is calculated taking into accountthe self-gravity and the Earth's tidal potential. Respectively the free energydensity is calculated. Since the axis of the Moon rotation has its own non-zerodeclination to the ecliptic plane, the tidal potential variations take placeduring the rotation of the Moon around the Earth.  The estimation of the corresponding free energy density variations are made.Their dependence on the depth exhibit qualitative agreement with the data ofdepth dependence in the energy of deep moonquakes obtained in the project"Apollo."  Integral estimations of variations in the free energy for the year shows thatit is many orders of magnitude greater than estimates of energy for the year ofdeep moonquakes energy. Thus offering an answer to the fundamental question:where is the source of energy released in the deep moonquakes.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Copula Models

  We study the task of unsupervised domain adaptation, where no labeled datafrom the target domain is provided during training time. To deal with thepotential discrepancy between the source and target distributions, both infeatures and labels, we exploit a copula-based regression framework. Thebenefits of this approach are two-fold: (a) it allows us to model a broaderrange of conditional predictive densities beyond the common exponential family,(b) we show how to leverage Sklar's theorem, the essence of the copulaformulation relating the joint density to the copula dependency functions, tofind effective feature mappings that mitigate the domain mismatch. Bytransforming the data to a copula domain, we show on a number of benchmarkdatasets (including human emotion estimation), and using different regressionmodels for prediction, that we can achieve a more robust and accurateestimation of target labels, compared to recently proposed featuretransformation (adaptation) methods.

Magnetic Field-Induced Fano Profiles in the Absorption Coefficient of  Semiconductors

  A strongly asymmetric, Fano-like resonance profile has been found formagneto-absorption in the states of hot free electron-hole pairs scattered bydefects in bulk semiconductors. The renormalization of the absorption profile,compared to that expected from the bare density of states in a high magneticfield, follows from a quasi-one-dimensional character of electronicexcitations. The results are valid for absorption by the electronic states oflarge Landau quantum number where the Coulomb interaction should play a minorrole. The resonance shape is in a good qualitattive agreement with experimentalobservations.

Nuclear Moments and Electron Density Functionals in Atoms

  An electron density functional approach for the calculation of the nuclearmultipole moments is presented. The electronic matrix elements entering theexperimentally observed hyperfine electron-nucleus interaction constants inatoms are expressed in terms of the electron density functionals of the chargeor spin distributions. In principle, the construction of the charge or spindistribution density functionals can be obtained by means of every relativisticor non-relativistic quantum-mechanical or DFT method. The electronic matrixelements for all the electronic operators of the existing Hamiltonians ofhyperfine electron-nuclear interactions are considered.

Jet Finslerian geometry of the conformal Minkowski metric

  The paper develops the Finsler-like geometry on the 1-jet space for the jetconformal Minkowski (JCM) metric, which naturally extends the Minkowski metricin the Chernov-Pavlov framework. To this aim there are determined the nonlinearconnection, distinguished (d-) Cartan linear connection, d-torsions andd-curvatures. The field geometrical gravitational and electromagnetic d-modelsbased on the JCM metric are discussed.

Generalised hydrodynamic reductions of the kinetic equation for soliton  gas

  We derive generalised multi-flow hydrodynamic reductions of the nonlocalkinetic equation for a soliton gas and investigate their structure. Thesereductions not only provide further insight into the properties of the newkinetic equation but also could prove to be representatives of a novel class ofintegrable systems of hydrodynamic type, beyond the conventionalsemi-Hamiltonian framework.

D-MFVI: Distributed Mean Field Variational Inference using Bregman ADMM

  Bayesian models provide a framework for probabilistic modelling of complexdatasets. However, many of such models are computationally demanding especiallyin the presence of large datasets. On the other hand, in sensor networkapplications, statistical (Bayesian) parameter estimation usually needsdistributed algorithms, in which both data and computation are distributedacross the nodes of the network. In this paper we propose a general frameworkfor distributed Bayesian learning using Bregman Alternating Direction Method ofMultipliers (B-ADMM). We demonstrate the utility of our framework, with MeanField Variational Bayes (MFVB) as the primitive for distributed MatrixFactorization (MF) and distributed affine structure from motion (SfM).

Zero-range potentials with Inner structure: fitting parameters for  resonance scattering

  The solution of the classical Fermi problem of low-energy neutron scatteringby nuclei, when the excitations of the nuclei in scattering processes are takeninto account, is found by the method of zero-range potentials with innerstructure. This model is a generalization of the Fermi zero-range potentialobtained by adding a non-trivial inner Hamiltonian and inner space withindefinite metric. We propose a general principle of analyticity of theCaley-transform of the S-scattering matrix, written as a function of wavenumber. This permits us to evaluate all parameters of the model, including theindefinite metric tensor of the inner space, once the spectrum of the innerHamiltonian, the scattering length and the effective radious are chosen.

Quaternionic Analysis and the Algebrodynamics

  We present the ``algebrodynamical'' approach to field-particle theory basedon a nonlinear generalization of the Cauchy-Riemann conditions tonon-commutative algebras of quaternion-like type. For complex quaternions thetheory is Lorentz invariant and naturally carries some gauge and twistorstructures. Point- and string-like singularities are considered asparticle-like formations; their electric charge is ``self-quantized''. A novel``causal Minkowski geometry with additional phase'' is presented that isinduced by the structure of primordial biquaternion algebra. On thisgeometrical background a self-consistent algebraic dynamics of singularities(``ensemble of dublicons'') is briefly discussed.

Relativistic Non-Thermal Bremsstrahlung Radiation

  By applying a method of virtual quanta we derive formulae for relativisticnon-thermal bremsstrahlung radiation from relativistic electrons as well asfrom protons and heavier particles with power-law momentum distribution $N(p)dp= k p^{-q} dp.$ We show that emission which originates from an electronscattering on an ion, represents the most significant component of relativisticnon-thermal bremsstrahlung. Radiation from an ion scattering on electron, knownas inverse bremsstrahlung, is shown to be negligible in overall non-thermalbremsstrahlung emission. These results arise from theory refinement, where weintroduce the dependence of relativistic kinetic energy of an incidentparticle, upon the energy of scattered photon. In part, it is also aconsequence of a different mass of particles and relativistic effects.

Magnetic-field-enhanced outgoing excitonic resonance in multi-phonon  Raman scattering from polar semiconductors

  A combined scattering mechanism involving the states of free electron-holepairs (exciton continuum) and discrete excitons as intermediate states in themulti-phonon Raman scattering leads to (1) a strong increase of the scatteringefficiency in the presence of a high magnetic field and to (2) an outgoingexcitonic resonance: the two features are not compatible when only free pairs(leading to a strong increase of the scattering efficiency under the appliedmagnetic field) or discrete excitons (resulting in the outgoing resonance atthe excitonic gap) are taken into account.

Learning Hypergraph Labeling for Feature Matching

  This study poses the feature correspondence problem as a hypergraph nodelabeling problem. Candidate feature matches and their subsets (usually of sizelarger than two) are considered to be the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph.A hypergraph labeling algorithm, which models the subset-wise interaction by anundirected graphical model, is applied to label the nodes (featurecorrespondences) as correct or incorrect. We describe a method to learn thecost function of this labeling algorithm from labeled examples using agraphical model training algorithm. The proposed feature matching algorithm isdifferent from the most of the existing learning point matching methods interms of the form of the objective function, the cost function to be learnedand the optimization method applied to minimize it. The results on standarddatasets demonstrate how learning over a hypergraph improves the matchingperformance over existing algorithms, notably one that also uses higher orderinformation without learning.

Heteroscedastic Conditional Ordinal Random Fields for Pain Intensity  Estimation from Facial Images

  We propose a novel method for automatic pain intensity estimation from facialimages based on the framework of kernel Conditional Ordinal Random Fields(KCORF). We extend this framework to account for heteroscedasticity on theoutput labels(i.e., pain intensity scores) and introduce a novel dynamicfeatures, dynamic ranks, that impose temporal ordinal constraints on the staticranks (i.e., intensity scores). Our experimental results show that the proposedapproach outperforms state-of-the art methods for sequence classification withordinal data and other ordinal regression models. The approach performssignificantly better than other models in terms of Intra-Class Correlationmeasure, which is the most accepted evaluation measure in the tasks of facialbehaviour intensity estimation.

Multi-layer Ti-based Coating Obtained by Arc PVD Method

  We report the obtaining and primary studies of ~ 250microns thick multi-layerTi-based protective coating deposited at high cooling rate from substancegenerated by cathode arc discharge in vacuum. High adhesion to steel substratewas attained through prior Arc plasma generator cleaning and successive IonBombardment method. All three arc-generated fractions including mainly droplet,vapour and ions have been utilised to form the coating. Obtained coatingfeatures pore-free, least defects and high hardness which, besides N presence,supposed to result from mainly martensitic transformations occurred at thepresence of Nitrogen. Two intermediate thin layers of Cu of few microns wereachieved to insert within coating presumably to reduce overall elastic modulusof the material.

Fast ADMM Algorithm for Distributed Optimization with Adaptive Penalty

  We propose new methods to speed up convergence of the Alternating DirectionMethod of Multipliers (ADMM), a common optimization tool in the context oflarge scale and distributed learning. The proposed method accelerates the speedof convergence by automatically deciding the constraint penalty needed forparameter consensus in each iteration. In addition, we also propose anextension of the method that adaptively determines the maximum number ofiterations to update the penalty. We show that this approach effectively leadsto an adaptive, dynamic network topology underlying the distributedoptimization. The utility of the new penalty update schemes is demonstrated onboth synthetic and real data, including a computer vision application ofdistributed structure from motion.

Multi-Cue Structure Preserving MRF for Unconstrained Video Segmentation

  Video segmentation is a stepping stone to understanding video context. Videosegmentation enables one to represent a video by decomposing it into coherentregions which comprise whole or parts of objects. However, the challengeoriginates from the fact that most of the video segmentation algorithms arebased on unsupervised learning due to expensive cost of pixelwise videoannotation and intra-class variability within similar unconstrained videoclasses. We propose a Markov Random Field model for unconstrained videosegmentation that relies on tight integration of multiple cues: vertices aredefined from contour based superpixels, unary potentials from temporal smoothlabel likelihood and pairwise potentials from global structure of a video.Multi-cue structure is a breakthrough to extracting coherent object regions forunconstrained videos in absence of supervision. Our experiments on VSB100dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms competingstate-of-the-art algorithms. Qualitative analysis illustrates that videosegmentation result of the proposed model is consistent with human perceptionof objects.

Discovering Characteristic Landmarks on Ancient Coins using  Convolutional Networks

  In this paper, we propose a novel method to find characteristic landmarks onancient Roman imperial coins using deep convolutional neural network models(CNNs). We formulate an optimization problem to discover class-specific regionswhile guaranteeing specific controlled loss of accuracy. Analysis onvisualization of the discovered region confirms that not only can the proposedmethod successfully find a set of characteristic regions per class, but alsothe discovered region is consistent with human expert annotations. We alsopropose a new framework to recognize the Roman coins which exploitshierarchical structure of the ancient Roman coins using the state-of-the-artclassification power of the CNNs adopted to a new task of coin classification.Experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to effectivelyrecognize the ancient Roman coins. For this research, we have collected a newRoman coin dataset where all coins are annotated and consist of observe (head)and reverse (tail) images.

Gaussian Process for Noisy Inputs with Ordering Constraints

  We study the Gaussian Process regression model in the context of trainingdata with noise in both input and output. The presence of two sources of noisemakes the task of learning accurate predictive models extremely challenging.However, in some instances additional constraints may be available that canreduce the uncertainty in the resulting predictive models. In particular, weconsider the case of monotonically ordered latent input, which occurs in manyapplication domains that deal with temporal data. We present a novel inferenceand learning approach based on non-parametric Gaussian variationalapproximation to learn the GP model while taking into account the newconstraints. The resulting strategy allows one to gain access to posteriorestimates of both the input and the output and results in improved predictiveperformance. We compare our proposed models to state-of-the-art Noisy InputGaussian Process (NIGP) and other competing approaches on synthetic and realsea-level rise data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approachconsistently outperforms selected methods while, at the same time, reducing thecomputational costs of learning and inference.

Intrinsic Non-stationary Covariance Function for Climate Modeling

  Designing a covariance function that represents the underlying correlation isa crucial step in modeling complex natural systems, such as climate models.Geospatial datasets at a global scale usually suffer from non-stationarity andnon-uniformly smooth spatial boundaries. A Gaussian process regression using anon-stationary covariance function has shown promise for this task, as thiscovariance function adapts to the variable correlation structure of theunderlying distribution. In this paper, we generalize the non-stationarycovariance function to address the aforementioned global scale geospatialissues. We define this generalized covariance function as an intrinsicnon-stationary covariance function, because it uses intrinsic statistics of thesymmetric positive definite matrices to represent the characteristic lengthscale and, thereby, models the local stochastic process. Experiments on asynthetic and real dataset of relative sea level changes across the worlddemonstrate improvements in the error metrics for the regression estimatesusing our newly proposed approach.

Robust Time-Series Retrieval Using Probabilistic Adaptive Segmental  Alignment

  Traditional pairwise sequence alignment is based on matching individualsamples from two sequences, under time monotonicity constraints. However, inmany application settings matching subsequences (segments) instead ofindividual samples may bring in additional robustness to noise or localnon-causal perturbations. This paper presents an approach to segmental sequencealignment that jointly segments and aligns two sequences, generalizing thetraditional per-sample alignment. To accomplish this task, we introduce adistance metric between segments based on average pairwise distances and thenpresent a modified pair-HMM (PHMM) that incorporates the proposed distancemetric to solve the joint segmentation and alignment task. We also propose arelaxation to our model that improves the computational efficiency of thegeneric segmental PHMM. Our results demonstrate that this new measure ofsequence similarity can lead to improved classification performance, whilebeing resilient to noise, on a variety of sequence retrieval problems, from EEGto motion sequence classification.

Cartoonish sketch-based face editing in videos using identity  deformation transfer

  We address the problem of using hand-drawn sketches to create exaggerateddeformations to faces in videos, such as enlarging the shape or modifying theposition of eyes or mouth. This task is formulated as a 3D face modelreconstruction and deformation problem. We first recover the facial identityand expressions from the video by fitting a face morphable model for eachframe. At the same time, user's editing intention is recognized from inputsketches as a set of facial modifications. Then a novel identity deformationalgorithm is proposed to transfer these facial deformations from 2D space tothe 3D facial identity directly while preserving the facial expressions. Afteran optional stage for further refining the 3D face model, these changes arepropagated to the whole video with the modified identity. Both the user studyand experimental results demonstrate that our sketching framework can helpusers effectively edit facial identities in videos, while high consistency andfidelity are ensured at the same time.

Giant field enhancement in high-index dielectric subwavelength particles

  Besides purely academic interest, giant field enhancement withinsubwavelength particles at light scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave isimportant for numerous applications ranging from telecommunications to medicineand biology. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the enhancement ofthe intensity of the magnetic field in a high-index dielectric cylinder at theproximity of the dipolar Mie resonances by more than two orders of magnitudefor both the TE and TM polarizations of the incident wave. We present acomplete theoretical explanation of the effect and show that the phenomenon isvery general - it should be observed for any high-index particles. The resultsexplain the huge enhancement of nonlinear effects observed recently in optics,suggesting a new landscape for all-dielectric nonlinear nanoscale photonics.

Deep Structured Learning for Facial Action Unit Intensity Estimation

  We consider the task of automated estimation of facial expression intensity.This involves estimation of multiple output variables (facial action units ---AUs) that are structurally dependent. Their structure arises from statisticallyinduced co-occurrence patterns of AU intensity levels. Modeling this structureis critical for improving the estimation performance; however, this performanceis bounded by the quality of the input features extracted from face images. Thegoal of this paper is to model these structures and estimate complex featurerepresentations simultaneously by combining conditional random field (CRF)encoded AU dependencies with deep learning. To this end, we propose a novelCopula CNN deep learning approach for modeling multivariate ordinal variables.Our model accounts for $ordinal$ structure in output variables and their$non$-$linear$ dependencies via copula functions modeled as cliques of a CRF.These are jointly optimized with deep CNN feature encoding layers using a newlyintroduced balanced batch iterative training algorithm. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our approach on the task of AU intensity estimation on twobenchmark datasets. We show that joint learning of the deep features and thetarget output structure results in significant performance gains compared toexisting deep structured models for analysis of facial expressions.

End-to-end Learning for 3D Facial Animation from Raw Waveforms of Speech

  We present a deep learning framework for real-time speech-driven 3D facialanimation from just raw waveforms. Our deep neural network directly maps aninput sequence of speech audio to a series of micro facial action unitactivations and head rotations to drive a 3D blendshape face model. Inparticular, our deep model is able to learn the latent representations oftime-varying contextual information and affective states within the speech.Hence, our model not only activates appropriate facial action units atinference to depict different utterance generating actions, in the form of lipmovements, but also, without any assumption, automatically estimates emotionalintensity of the speaker and reproduces her ever-changing affective states byadjusting strength of facial unit activations. For example, in a happy speech,the mouth opens wider than normal, while other facial units are relaxed; or ina surprised state, both eyebrows raise higher. Experiments on a diverseaudiovisual corpus of different actors across a wide range of emotional statesshow interesting and promising results of our approach. Beingspeaker-independent, our generalized model is readily applicable to varioustasks in human-machine interaction and animation.

The Role of Data-driven Priors in Multi-agent Crowd Trajectory  Estimation

  Trajectory interpolation, the process of filling-in the gaps and removingnoise from observed agent trajectories, is an essential task for the motioninference in multi-agent setting. A desired trajectory interpolation methodshould be robust to noise, changes in environments or agent densities, whilealso being yielding realistic group movement behaviors. Such realisticbehaviors are, however, challenging to model as they require avoidance ofagent-agent or agent-environment collisions and, at the same time, seekcomputational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework composedof data-driven priors (local, global or combined) and an efficient optimizationstrategy for multi-agent trajectory interpolation. The data-driven priorsimplicitly encode the dependencies of movements of multiple agents and thecollision-avoiding desiderata, enabling elimination of costly pairwisecollision constraints and resulting in reduced computational complexity andoften improved estimation. Various combinations of priors and optimizationalgorithms are evaluated in comprehensive simulated experiments. Ourexperimental results reveal important insights, including the significance ofthe global flow prior and the lesser-than-expected influence of data-drivencollision priors.

Unsupervised Multi-Target Domain Adaptation: An Information Theoretic  Approach

  Unsupervised domain adaptation (uDA) models focus on pairwise adaptationsettings where there is a single, labeled, source and a single target domain.However, in many real-world settings one seeks to adapt to multiple, butsomewhat similar, target domains. Applying pairwise adaptation approaches tothis setting may be suboptimal, as they fail to leverage shared informationamong multiple domains. In this work we propose an information theoreticapproach for domain adaptation in the novel context of multiple target domainswith unlabeled instances and one source domain with labeled instances. Ourmodel aims to find a shared latent space common to all domains, whilesimultaneously accounting for the remaining private, domain-specific factors.Disentanglement of shared and private information is accomplished using aunified information-theoretic approach, which also serves to establish astronger link between the latent representations and the observed data. Theresulting model, accompanied by an efficient optimization algorithm, allowssimultaneous adaptation from a single source to multiple target domains. Wetest our approach on three challenging publicly-available datasets, showingthat it outperforms several popular domain adaptation methods.

Relevance Factor VAE: Learning and Identifying Disentangled Factors

  We propose a novel VAE-based deep auto-encoder model that can learndisentangled latent representations in a fully unsupervised manner, endowedwith the ability to identify all meaningful sources of variation and theircardinality. Our model, dubbed Relevance-Factor-VAE, leverages the totalcorrelation (TC) in the latent space to achieve the disentanglement goal, butalso addresses the key issue of existing approaches which cannot distinguishbetween meaningful and nuisance factors of latent variation, often the sourceof considerable degradation in disentanglement performance. We tackle thisissue by introducing the so-called relevance indicator variables that can beautomatically learned from data, together with the VAE parameters. Our modeleffectively focuses the TC loss onto the relevant factors only by toleratinglarge prior KL divergences, a desideratum justified by our semi-parametrictheoretical analysis. Using a suite of disentanglement metrics, including anewly proposed one, as well as qualitative evidence, we demonstrate that ourmodel outperforms existing methods across several challenging benchmarkdatasets.

Unsupervised Visual Domain Adaptation: A Deep Max-Margin Gaussian  Process Approach

  In unsupervised domain adaptation, it is widely known that the target domainerror can be provably reduced by having a shared input representation thatmakes the source and target domains indistinguishable from each other. Veryrecently it has been studied that not just matching the marginal inputdistributions, but the alignment of output (class) distributions is alsocritical. The latter can be achieved by minimizing the maximum discrepancy ofpredictors (classifiers). In this paper, we adopt this principle, but propose amore systematic and effective way to achieve hypothesis consistency viaGaussian processes (GP). The GP allows us to define/induce a hypothesis spaceof the classifiers from the posterior distribution of the latent randomfunctions, turning the learning into a simple large-margin posterior separationproblem, far easier to solve than previous approaches based on adversarialminimax optimization. We formulate a learning objective that effectively pushesthe posterior to minimize the maximum discrepancy. This is further shown to beequivalent to maximizing margins and minimizing uncertainty of the classpredictions in the target domain, a well-established principle in classical(semi-)supervised learning. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach iscomparable or superior to the existing methods on several benchmark domainadaptation datasets.

Determining parameters of Moon's orbital and rotational motion from LLR  observations using GRAIL and IERS-recommended models

  The aim of this work is to combine the model of orbital and rotational motionof the Moon developed for DE430 with up-to-date astronomical, geodynamical, andgeo- and selenophysical models. The parameters of the orbit and physicallibration are determined in this work from LLR observations made at differentobservatories in 1970-2013. Parameters of other models are taken from solutionsthat were obtained independently from LLR.  A new implementation of the DE430 lunar model, including the liquid coreequations, was done within the EPM ephemeris. The postfit residuals of LLRobservations make evident that the terrestrial models and solutions recommendedby the IERS Conventions are compatible with the lunar theory. That includes:EGM2008 with conventional corrections and variations from solid and oceantides; displacement of stations due to solid and ocean loading tides; andprecession-nutation model. Usage of these models in the solution for LLRobservations has allowed us to reduce the number of parameters to be fit. Thefixed model of tidal variations of the geopotential has resulted in a lesservalue of Moon's extra eccentricity rate, as compared to the original DE430model with two fit parameters.  A mixed model of lunar gravitational potential was used, with somecoefficients determined from LLR observations, and other taken from the GL660bsolution.  Solutions obtain accurate positions for the ranging stations and the 5retroreflectors. Station motion is derived for sites with long data spans.Dissipation is detected at the lunar fluid core-solid mantle boundarydemonstrating that a fluid core is present. Tidal dissipation is strong at bothEarth and Moon. Consequently, the lunar semimajor axis is expanding by 38.20mm/yr, the tidal acceleration in mean longitude is -25.90 "/cy2, and theeccentricity is increasing by 1.48e-11 each year.

Robust Performance-driven 3D Face Tracking in Long Range Depth Scenes

  We introduce a novel robust hybrid 3D face tracking framework from RGBD videostreams, which is capable of tracking head pose and facial actions withoutpre-calibration or intervention from a user. In particular, we emphasize onimproving the tracking performance in instances where the tracked subject is ata large distance from the cameras, and the quality of point cloud deterioratesseverely. This is accomplished by the combination of a flexible 3D shaperegressor and the joint 2D+3D optimization on shape parameters. Our approachfits facial blendshapes to the point cloud of the human head, while beingdriven by an efficient and rapid 3D shape regressor trained on generic RGBdatasets. As an on-line tracking system, the identity of the unknown user isadapted on-the-fly resulting in improved 3D model reconstruction andconsequently better tracking performance. The result is a robust RGBD facetracker, capable of handling a wide range of target scene depths, beyond thosethat can be afforded by traditional depth or RGB face trackers. Lastly, sincethe blendshape is not able to accurately recover the real facial shape, we usethe tracked 3D face model as a prior in a novel filtering process to furtherrefine the depth map for use in other tasks, such as 3D reconstruction.

Variable-state Latent Conditional Random Fields for Facial Expression  Recognition and Action Unit Detection

  Automated recognition of facial expressions of emotions, and detection offacial action units (AUs), from videos depends critically on modeling of theirdynamics. These dynamics are characterized by changes in temporal phases(onset-apex-offset) and intensity of emotion expressions and AUs, theappearance of which may vary considerably among target subjects, making therecognition/detection task very challenging. The state-of-the-art LatentConditional Random Fields (L-CRF) framework allows one to efficiently encodethese dynamics through the latent states accounting for the temporalconsistency in emotion expression and ordinal relationships between itsintensity levels, these latent states are typically assumed to be eitherunordered (nominal) or fully ordered (ordinal). Yet, such an approach is oftentoo restrictive. For instance, in the case of AU detection, the goal is todiscriminate between the segments of an image sequence in which this AU isactive or inactive. While the sequence segments containing activation of thetarget AU may better be described using ordinal latent states, the inactivesegments better be described using unordered (nominal) latent states, as noassumption can be made about their underlying structure (since they can containeither neutral faces or activations of non-target AUs). To address this, wepropose the variable-state L-CRF (VSL-CRF) model that automatically selects theoptimal latent states for the target image sequence. To reduce the modeloverfitting either the nominal or ordinal latent states, we propose a novelgraph-Laplacian regularization of the latent states. Our experiments on threepublic expression databases show that the proposed model achieves bettergeneralization performance compared to traditional L-CRFs and other relatedstate-of-the-art models.

Generative Adversarial Talking Head: Bringing Portraits to Life with a  Weakly Supervised Neural Network

  This paper presents Generative Adversarial Talking Head (GATH), a novel deepgenerative neural network that enables fully automatic facial expressionsynthesis of an arbitrary portrait with continuous action unit (AU)coefficients. Specifically, our model directly manipulates image pixels to makethe unseen subject in the still photo express various emotions controlled byvalues of facial AU coefficients, while maintaining her personalcharacteristics, such as facial geometry, skin color and hair style, as well asthe original surrounding background. In contrast to prior work, GATH is purelydata-driven and it requires neither a statistical face model nor imageprocessing tricks to enact facial deformations. Additionally, our model istrained from unpaired data, where the input image, with its auxiliary identitylabel taken from abundance of still photos in the wild, and the target frameare from different persons. In order to effectively learn such model, wepropose a novel weakly supervised adversarial learning framework that consistsof a generator, a discriminator, a classifier and an action unit estimator. Ourwork gives rise to template-and-target-free expression editing, where stillfaces can be effortlessly animated with arbitrary AU coefficients provided bythe user.

Tailoring high temperature quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity

  We report the first observation of superconductivity in heterostructureconsisting of an insulating ferroelectric film (Ba$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$TiO$_3$) onan insulator single crystal in [001] orientation (La$_2$CuO$_4$), created bymagnetron sputtering on a non-atomically-flat surface with inhomogeneities ofthe order of 1-2 nm. In this heterostructure the superconducting phasetransition temperature Tc gets as high as 30K. It has been shown experimentallythat it is possible to create a high-T$_c$ quasi-two-dimensionalsuperconductivity (HTq2DSC) by a relatively simple method at the boundary ofthe ferroelectric and parent compound of the high temperature superconductor(PCHTSC). In this case it becomes possible to create HTq2DSC on anon-atomically-flat surface. This highly robust phenomenon is confined withinthe interface area. If a weak magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to theinterface of the heterostructure, a resistance appears. That confirms aquasi-two-dimensional nature of the superconductive state. The proposed conceptpromises ferroelectrically controlled interface superconductivity which offersthe possibility of novel design of electronic devices.

Report of the IAU Commission 4 Working Group on Standardizing Access to  Ephemerides and File Format Specification

  The IAU Commission 4 Working Group on Standardizing Access to Ephemeridesrecommends the use of the Spacecraft and Planet Kernel (SPK) format as astandard format for the position ephemerides of planets and other natural solarsystem bodies, and the use of the Planetary Constants Kernel (PCK) format forthe orientation of these bodies. It further recommends that other supportingdata be stored in a text PCK. These formats were developed for use by the SPICEToolkit by the Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility of NASA's JetPropulsion Laboratory (JPL). The CALCEPH library developed by the Institut demecanique celeste de calcul des ephemerides (IMCCE) is also able to make use ofthese files. High accuracy ephemerides available in files conforming to the SPKand PCK formats include: the Development Ephemerides (DE) from JPL, IntegrateurNumerique Planetaire de l'Observatoire de Paris (INPOP) from IMCCE, and theEphemerides Planets and the Moon (EPM), developed by the Institute for AppliedAstronomy (IAA). The bulk of this report is a description of the portion of PCKand SPK formats required for these ephemerides. New SPK and PCK data types,both called Type 20: Chebyshev (Velocity Only), have been added. Other changesto the specification are (i) a new object identification number for coordinatetime ephemerides and (ii) a set of three new data types that use the TCB ratherthan the TDB time scale for the ephemerides, but are otherwise identical totheir TDB versions.

Exploring Extreme Space Weather Factors of Exoplanetary Habitability

  It is currently unknown how common life is on exoplanets, or how long planetscan remain viable for life. To date, we have a superficial notion ofhabitability, a necessary first step, but so far lacking an understanding ofthe detailed interaction between stars and planets over geological timescales,dynamical evolution of planetary systems, and atmospheric evolution on planetsin other systems. A planet mass, net insolation, and atmospheric compositionalone are insufficient to determine the probability that life on a planet couldarise or be detected. The latter set of planetary considerations, among others,underpin the concept of the habitable zone (HZ), defined as the circumstellarregion where standing bodies of liquid water could be supported on the surfaceof a rocky planet. However, stars within the same spectral class are oftentreated in the same way in HZ studies, without any regard for variations inactivity among individual stars. Such formulations ignore differences in hownonthermal emission and magnetic energy of transient events in different starsaffect the ability of an exoplanet to retain its atmosphere.In the last fewyears there has been a growing appreciation that the atmospheric chemistry, andeven retention of an atmosphere in many cases, depends critically on thehigh-energy radiation and particle environments around these stars. Indeed,recent studies have shown stellar activity and the extreme space weather, suchas that created by the frequent flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) fromthe active stars and young Sun, may have profoundly affected the chemistry andclimate and thus habitability of the early Earth and terrestrial typeexoplanets. The goal of this white paper is to identify and describe promisingkey research goals to aid the field of the exoplanetary habitability for thenext 20 years.
