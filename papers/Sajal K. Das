Sustainable Incentives for Mobile Crowdsensing: Auctions, Lotteries, and  Trust and Reputation Systems

  Proper incentive mechanisms are critical for mobile crowdsensing systems tomotivate people to actively and persistently participate. This article providesan exposition of design principles of six incentive mechanisms, drawing specialattention to the sustainability issue. We cover three primary classes ofincentive mechanisms: auctions, lotteries, and trust and reputation systems, aswell as three other frameworks of promising potential: bargaining games,contract theory, and market-driven mechanisms.

Incentive Mechanisms for Participatory Sensing: Survey and Research  Challenges

  Participatory sensing is a powerful paradigm which takes advantage ofsmartphones to collect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previouslypossible. Given that participatory sensing systems rely completely on theusers' willingness to submit up-to-date and accurate information, it isparamount to effectively incentivize users' active and reliable participation.In this paper, we survey existing literature on incentive mechanisms forparticipatory sensing systems. In particular, we present a taxonomy of existingincentive mechanisms for participatory sensing systems, which are subsequentlydiscussed in depth by comparing and contrasting different approaches. Finally,we discuss an agenda of open research challenges in incentivizing users inparticipatory sensing.

Towards a Realistic Model for Failure Propagation in Interdependent  Networks

  Modern networks are becoming increasingly interdependent. As a prominentexample, the smart grid is an electrical grid controlled through acommunications network, which in turn is powered by the electrical grid. Suchinterdependencies create new vulnerabilities and make these networks moresusceptible to failures. In particular, failures can easily spread across thesenetworks due to their interdependencies, possibly causing cascade effects witha devastating impact on their functionalities.  In this paper we focus on the interdependence between the power grid and thecommunications network, and propose a novel realistic model, HINT(Heterogeneous Interdependent NeTworks), to study the evolution of cascadingfailures. Our model takes into account the heterogeneity of such networks aswell as their complex interdependencies. We compare HINT with previouslyproposed models both on synthetic and real network topologies. Experimentalresults show that existing models oversimplify the failure evolution andnetwork functionality requirements, resulting in severe underestimations of thecascading failures.

CSWA: Aggregation-Free Spatial-Temporal Community Sensing

  In this paper, we present a novel community sensing paradigm -- {C}ommunity{S}ensing {W}ithout {A}ggregation}. CSWA is designed to obtain the environmentinformation (e.g., air pollution or temperature) in each subarea of the targetarea, without aggregating sensor and location data collected by communitymembers. CSWA operates on top of a secured peer-to-peer network over thecommunity members and proposes a novel \emph{Decentralized Spatial-TemporalCompressive Sensing} framework based on \emph{Parallelized Stochastic GradientDescent}. Through learning the \emph{low-rank structure} via distributedoptimization, CSWA approximates the value of the sensor data in each subarea(both covered and uncovered) for each sensing cycle using the sensor datalocally stored in each member's mobile device. Simulation experiments based onreal-world datasets demonstrate that CSWA exhibits low approximation error(i.e., less than $0.2 ^\circ$C in city-wide temperature sensing task and $10$units of PM2.5 index in urban air pollution sensing) and performs comparably to(sometimes better than) state-of-the-art algorithms based on the dataaggregation and centralized computation.

FIRST: A Framework for Optimizing Information Quality in Mobile  Crowdsensing Systems

  Mobile crowdsensing allows data collection at a scale and pace that was onceimpossible. One of the biggest challenges in mobile crowdsensing is thatparticipants may exhibit malicious or unreliable behavior. Therefore, itbecomes imperative to design algorithms to accurately classify between reliableand unreliable sensing reports. To this end, we propose a novel Framework foroptimizing Information Reliability in Smartphone-based participaTory sensing(FIRST), that leverages mobile trusted participants (MTPs) to securely assessthe reliability of sensing reports. FIRST models and solves the challengingproblem of determining before deployment the minimum number of MTPs to be usedin order to achieve desired classification accuracy. We extensively evaluateFIRST through an implementation in iOS and Android of a room occupancymonitoring system, and through simulations with real-world mobility traces.Experimental results demonstrate that FIRST reduces significantly the impact ofthree security attacks (i.e., corruption, on/off, and collusion), by achievinga classification accuracy of almost 80% in the considered scenarios. Finally,we discuss our ongoing research efforts to test the performance of FIRST aspart of the National Map Corps project.

IncentMe: Effective Mechanism Design to Stimulate Crowdsensing  Participants with Uncertain Mobility

  Mobile crowdsensing harnesses the sensing power of modern smartphones tocollect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possible. In amobile crowdsensing system, it is paramount to incentivize smartphone users toprovide sensing services in a timely and reliable manner. Given sensedinformation is often valid for a limited period of time, the capability ofsmartphone users to execute sensing tasks largely depends on their mobility,which is often uncertain. For this reason, in this paper we propose IncentMe, aframework that solves this fundamental problem by leveraging game-theoreticalreverse auction mechanism design. After demonstrating that the proposed problemis NP-hard, we derive two mechanisms that are parallelizable and achieve higherapproximation ratio than existing work. IncentMe has been extensively evaluatedon a road traffic monitoring application implemented using mobility traces oftaxi cabs in San Francisco, Rome, and Beijing. Results demonstrate that themechanisms in IncentMe outperform prior work by improving the efficiency inrecruiting participants by 30%.

Blockchain for the Internet of Things: Present and Future

  One of the key challenges to the IoT's success is how to secure and anonymizebillions of IoT transactions and devices per day, an issue that still lingersdespite significant research efforts over the last few years. On the otherhand, technologies based on blockchain algorithms are disrupting today'scryptocurrency markets and showing tremendous potential, since they provide adistributed transaction ledger that cannot be tampered with or controlled by asingle entity. Although the blockchain may present itself as a cure-all for theIoT's security and privacy challenges, significant research efforts still needto be put forth to adapt the computation-intensive blockchain algorithms to thestringent energy and processing constraints of today's IoT devices. In thispaper, we provide an overview of existing literature on the topic of blockchainfor IoT, and present a roadmap of research challenges that will need to beaddressed to enable the usage of blockchain technologies in the IoT.

PS-Sim: A Framework for Scalable Simulation of Participatory Sensing  Data

  Emergence of smartphone and the participatory sensing (PS) paradigm havepaved the way for a new variant of pervasive computing. In PS, human userperforms sensing tasks and generates notifications, typically in lieu ofincentives. These notifications are real-time, large-volume, and multi-modal,which are eventually fused by the PS platform to generate a summary. One majorlimitation with PS is the sparsity of notifications owing to lack of activeparticipation, thus inhibiting large scale real-life experiments for theresearch community. On the flip side, research community always needs groundtruth to validate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms. Most ofthe PS applications involve human mobility and report generation followingsensing of any event of interest in the adjacent environment. This work is anattempt to study and empirically model human participation behavior and eventoccurrence distributions through development of a location-sensitive datasimulation framework, called PS-Sim. From extensive experiments it has beenobserved that the synthetic data generated by PS-Sim replicates realparticipation and event occurrence behaviors in PS applications, which may beconsidered for validation purpose in absence of the groundtruth. As aproof-of-concept, we have used real-life dataset from a vehicular trafficmanagement application to train the models in PS-Sim and cross-validated thesimulated data with other parts of the same dataset.

A General Model for MAC Protocol Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks

  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being deployed for differentapplications, each having its own structure, goals and requirements. Mediumaccess control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and hence shouldbe tuned to the applications. However, there is no for selecting MAC protocolsfor different situations. Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol isgood for a given situation. Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, onthe other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that the protocols inthe same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is tointroduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the givenrequirements from the category that performs better for a given context. Wedefine the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performanceof different categories protocols for different contexts. Having the generalmodel, we then discuss the model scalability for adding new protocols,categories, requirements, and performance criteria. Considering energyconsumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, wefocus on deriving mathematical models for them. The results extracted from CPFare the same as the well-known rule of thumb for the MAC protocols thatverifies our model. We validate our models with the help of simulation study.We also implemented the current CPF model in a web page to make the modelonline and useful.

Optimal Prizes for All-Pay Contests in Heterogeneous Crowdsourcing

  Incentives are key to the success of crowdsourcing which heavily depends onthe level of user participation. This paper designs an incentive mechanism tomotivate a heterogeneous crowd of users to actively participate incrowdsourcing campaigns. We cast the problem in a new, asymmetric all-paycontest model with incomplete information, where an arbitrary n of users exertirrevocable effort to compete for a prize tuple. The prize tuple is an array ofprize functions as opposed to a single constant prize typically used byconventional contests. We design an optimal contest that (a) induces themaximum profit---total user effort minus the prize payout---for thecrowdsourcer, and (b) ensures users to strictly have the incentive toparticipate. In stark contrast to intuition and prior related work, ourmechanism induces an equilibrium in which heterogeneous users behaveindependently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. Thisnewly discovered property, which we coin as strategy autonomy (SA), is ofpractical significance: it (a) reduces computational and storage complexity byn-fold for each user, (b) increases the crowdsourcer's revenue by counteractingan effort reservation effect existing in asymmetric contests, and (c)neutralizes the (almost universal) law of diminishing marginal returns (DMR).Through an extensive numerical case study, we demonstrate and scrutinize thesuperior profitability of our mechanism, as well as draw insights into the SAproperty.
