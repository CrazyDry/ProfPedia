Sustainable Incentives for Mobile Crowdsensing: Auctions, Lotteries, and
  Trust and Reputation Systems

  Proper incentive mechanisms are critical for mobile crowdsensing systems to
motivate people to actively and persistently participate. This article provides
an exposition of design principles of six incentive mechanisms, drawing special
attention to the sustainability issue. We cover three primary classes of
incentive mechanisms: auctions, lotteries, and trust and reputation systems, as
well as three other frameworks of promising potential: bargaining games,
contract theory, and market-driven mechanisms.


Incentive Mechanisms for Participatory Sensing: Survey and Research
  Challenges

  Participatory sensing is a powerful paradigm which takes advantage of
smartphones to collect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously
possible. Given that participatory sensing systems rely completely on the
users' willingness to submit up-to-date and accurate information, it is
paramount to effectively incentivize users' active and reliable participation.
In this paper, we survey existing literature on incentive mechanisms for
participatory sensing systems. In particular, we present a taxonomy of existing
incentive mechanisms for participatory sensing systems, which are subsequently
discussed in depth by comparing and contrasting different approaches. Finally,
we discuss an agenda of open research challenges in incentivizing users in
participatory sensing.


Towards a Realistic Model for Failure Propagation in Interdependent
  Networks

  Modern networks are becoming increasingly interdependent. As a prominent
example, the smart grid is an electrical grid controlled through a
communications network, which in turn is powered by the electrical grid. Such
interdependencies create new vulnerabilities and make these networks more
susceptible to failures. In particular, failures can easily spread across these
networks due to their interdependencies, possibly causing cascade effects with
a devastating impact on their functionalities.
  In this paper we focus on the interdependence between the power grid and the
communications network, and propose a novel realistic model, HINT
(Heterogeneous Interdependent NeTworks), to study the evolution of cascading
failures. Our model takes into account the heterogeneity of such networks as
well as their complex interdependencies. We compare HINT with previously
proposed models both on synthetic and real network topologies. Experimental
results show that existing models oversimplify the failure evolution and
network functionality requirements, resulting in severe underestimations of the
cascading failures.


CSWA: Aggregation-Free Spatial-Temporal Community Sensing

  In this paper, we present a novel community sensing paradigm -- {C}ommunity
{S}ensing {W}ithout {A}ggregation}. CSWA is designed to obtain the environment
information (e.g., air pollution or temperature) in each subarea of the target
area, without aggregating sensor and location data collected by community
members. CSWA operates on top of a secured peer-to-peer network over the
community members and proposes a novel \emph{Decentralized Spatial-Temporal
Compressive Sensing} framework based on \emph{Parallelized Stochastic Gradient
Descent}. Through learning the \emph{low-rank structure} via distributed
optimization, CSWA approximates the value of the sensor data in each subarea
(both covered and uncovered) for each sensing cycle using the sensor data
locally stored in each member's mobile device. Simulation experiments based on
real-world datasets demonstrate that CSWA exhibits low approximation error
(i.e., less than $0.2 ^\circ$C in city-wide temperature sensing task and $10$
units of PM2.5 index in urban air pollution sensing) and performs comparably to
(sometimes better than) state-of-the-art algorithms based on the data
aggregation and centralized computation.


FIRST: A Framework for Optimizing Information Quality in Mobile
  Crowdsensing Systems

  Mobile crowdsensing allows data collection at a scale and pace that was once
impossible. One of the biggest challenges in mobile crowdsensing is that
participants may exhibit malicious or unreliable behavior. Therefore, it
becomes imperative to design algorithms to accurately classify between reliable
and unreliable sensing reports. To this end, we propose a novel Framework for
optimizing Information Reliability in Smartphone-based participaTory sensing
(FIRST), that leverages mobile trusted participants (MTPs) to securely assess
the reliability of sensing reports. FIRST models and solves the challenging
problem of determining before deployment the minimum number of MTPs to be used
in order to achieve desired classification accuracy. We extensively evaluate
FIRST through an implementation in iOS and Android of a room occupancy
monitoring system, and through simulations with real-world mobility traces.
Experimental results demonstrate that FIRST reduces significantly the impact of
three security attacks (i.e., corruption, on/off, and collusion), by achieving
a classification accuracy of almost 80% in the considered scenarios. Finally,
we discuss our ongoing research efforts to test the performance of FIRST as
part of the National Map Corps project.


IncentMe: Effective Mechanism Design to Stimulate Crowdsensing
  Participants with Uncertain Mobility

  Mobile crowdsensing harnesses the sensing power of modern smartphones to
collect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possible. In a
mobile crowdsensing system, it is paramount to incentivize smartphone users to
provide sensing services in a timely and reliable manner. Given sensed
information is often valid for a limited period of time, the capability of
smartphone users to execute sensing tasks largely depends on their mobility,
which is often uncertain. For this reason, in this paper we propose IncentMe, a
framework that solves this fundamental problem by leveraging game-theoretical
reverse auction mechanism design. After demonstrating that the proposed problem
is NP-hard, we derive two mechanisms that are parallelizable and achieve higher
approximation ratio than existing work. IncentMe has been extensively evaluated
on a road traffic monitoring application implemented using mobility traces of
taxi cabs in San Francisco, Rome, and Beijing. Results demonstrate that the
mechanisms in IncentMe outperform prior work by improving the efficiency in
recruiting participants by 30%.


Blockchain for the Internet of Things: Present and Future

  One of the key challenges to the IoT's success is how to secure and anonymize
billions of IoT transactions and devices per day, an issue that still lingers
despite significant research efforts over the last few years. On the other
hand, technologies based on blockchain algorithms are disrupting today's
cryptocurrency markets and showing tremendous potential, since they provide a
distributed transaction ledger that cannot be tampered with or controlled by a
single entity. Although the blockchain may present itself as a cure-all for the
IoT's security and privacy challenges, significant research efforts still need
to be put forth to adapt the computation-intensive blockchain algorithms to the
stringent energy and processing constraints of today's IoT devices. In this
paper, we provide an overview of existing literature on the topic of blockchain
for IoT, and present a roadmap of research challenges that will need to be
addressed to enable the usage of blockchain technologies in the IoT.


PS-Sim: A Framework for Scalable Simulation of Participatory Sensing
  Data

  Emergence of smartphone and the participatory sensing (PS) paradigm have
paved the way for a new variant of pervasive computing. In PS, human user
performs sensing tasks and generates notifications, typically in lieu of
incentives. These notifications are real-time, large-volume, and multi-modal,
which are eventually fused by the PS platform to generate a summary. One major
limitation with PS is the sparsity of notifications owing to lack of active
participation, thus inhibiting large scale real-life experiments for the
research community. On the flip side, research community always needs ground
truth to validate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms. Most of
the PS applications involve human mobility and report generation following
sensing of any event of interest in the adjacent environment. This work is an
attempt to study and empirically model human participation behavior and event
occurrence distributions through development of a location-sensitive data
simulation framework, called PS-Sim. From extensive experiments it has been
observed that the synthetic data generated by PS-Sim replicates real
participation and event occurrence behaviors in PS applications, which may be
considered for validation purpose in absence of the groundtruth. As a
proof-of-concept, we have used real-life dataset from a vehicular traffic
management application to train the models in PS-Sim and cross-validated the
simulated data with other parts of the same dataset.


A General Model for MAC Protocol Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks

  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being deployed for different
applications, each having its own structure, goals and requirements. Medium
access control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and hence should
be tuned to the applications. However, there is no for selecting MAC protocols
for different situations. Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol is
good for a given situation. Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, on
the other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that the protocols in
the same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to
introduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the given
requirements from the category that performs better for a given context. We
define the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance
of different categories protocols for different contexts. Having the general
model, we then discuss the model scalability for adding new protocols,
categories, requirements, and performance criteria. Considering energy
consumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, we
focus on deriving mathematical models for them. The results extracted from CPF
are the same as the well-known rule of thumb for the MAC protocols that
verifies our model. We validate our models with the help of simulation study.
We also implemented the current CPF model in a web page to make the model
online and useful.


Optimal Prizes for All-Pay Contests in Heterogeneous Crowdsourcing

  Incentives are key to the success of crowdsourcing which heavily depends on
the level of user participation. This paper designs an incentive mechanism to
motivate a heterogeneous crowd of users to actively participate in
crowdsourcing campaigns. We cast the problem in a new, asymmetric all-pay
contest model with incomplete information, where an arbitrary n of users exert
irrevocable effort to compete for a prize tuple. The prize tuple is an array of
prize functions as opposed to a single constant prize typically used by
conventional contests. We design an optimal contest that (a) induces the
maximum profit---total user effort minus the prize payout---for the
crowdsourcer, and (b) ensures users to strictly have the incentive to
participate. In stark contrast to intuition and prior related work, our
mechanism induces an equilibrium in which heterogeneous users behave
independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. This
newly discovered property, which we coin as strategy autonomy (SA), is of
practical significance: it (a) reduces computational and storage complexity by
n-fold for each user, (b) increases the crowdsourcer's revenue by counteracting
an effort reservation effect existing in asymmetric contests, and (c)
neutralizes the (almost universal) law of diminishing marginal returns (DMR).
Through an extensive numerical case study, we demonstrate and scrutinize the
superior profitability of our mechanism, as well as draw insights into the SA
property.
