  We address the local and global well-posedness issues of strong solutions tothe anelastic equations for viscous flows. The density profile is taken tosatisfy physical vacuum singularity, and the interaction of the density profilewith the velocity fields is taken into account. The existing time of thesolutions is global in two dimension with general initial data, and in threedimension with small initial data.

  The (d,1)-total labelling of graphs was introduced by Havet and Yu. In thispaper, we consider the list version of (d,1)-total labelling of graphs. Let Gbe a graph embedded in a surface with Euler characteristic $\epsilon$ whosemaximum degree $\Delta(G)$ is sufficiently large. We prove that the (d,1)-totalchoosability $C_{d,1}^T(G)$ of $G$ is at most $\Delta(G)+2d$.

  In this paper, the decomposition of SU(2) gauge potential in terms of Paulispinors is studied. Using this decomposition, the spinor strutures of theChern-Simons form and the Chern density are obtained. Furthermore, by thesespinor structures, the knot quantum number of non-Abelian gauge theory isdiscussed, and the second Chern number is characterized by the Hopf indices andthe Brouwer degrees of $\phi $-mapping.

Amino acid substitution matrices for protein conformation identification

  Methods for alignment of protein sequences typically measure similarity byusing substitution matrix with scores for all possible exchanges of one aminoacid with another. Although widely used, the matrices derived from homologoussequence segments, such as Dayhoff's PAM matrices and Henikoff's BLOSUMmatrices, are not specific for protein conformation identification. Using adifferent approach, we got many amino acid segment blocks. For each of them,the protein secondary structure is identical. Based on these blocks, we havederived new amino acid substitution matrices. The application of these matricesled to marked improvements in conformation segment search and homologuesdetection in twilight zone.

Knot polynomial invariants in classical Abelian Chern-Simons field  theory

  Kauffman knot polynomial invariants are discovered in classical abelianChern-Simons field theory. A topological invariant $t^{I\left( \mathcal{L}\right) }$ is constructed for a link $\mathcal{L}$, where $I$ is the abelianChern-Simons action and $t$ a formal constant. For oriented knotted vortexlines, $t^{I}$ satisfies the skein relations of the Kauffman R-polynomial; forun-oriented knotted lines, $t^{I}$ satisfies the skein relations of theKauffman bracket polynomial. As an example the bracket polynomials of trefoilknots are computed, and the Jones polynomial is constructed from the bracketpolynomial.

A remote response of ATP hydrolysis

  ATP-hydrolysis is the basic energy source of many physiological processes,but there is a lack of knowledge regarding its biological role other thanenergy transfer and thermogenesis. Not all the energy released byATP-hydrolysis could be used in powering target biological processes andfunctions. Partial energy dissipates into water. By validating the impact ofthis dissipated energy, we found that energy released by ATP hydrolysis couldinduce notable regulation of biomolecule's properties 100 nanometers away.Namely ATP hydrolyzation is recycled in remote biochemical property modulation.

  We introduce a model concerning radiational gaseous stars and establish theexistence theory of stationary solutions to the free boundary problem ofhydrostatic equations describing the radiative equilibrium. We also concern thelocal well-posedness of the moving boundary problem of the correspondingNavier-Stokes-Fourier-Poisson system and construct a prior estimates of strongand classical solutions. Our results explore the vacuum behaviour of densityand temperature near the free boundary for the equilibrium and capture suchdegeneracy in the evolutionary problem.

Topological invariants for superconducting cosmic strings

  Superconducting cosmic strings (SCSs) have received revived interestsrecently. In this paper we treat closed SCSs as oriented knotted line defects,and concentrate on their topology by studying the Hopf topological invariant.This invariant is an Abelian Chern-Simons action, from which the HOMFLYPT knotpolynomial can be constructed. It is shown that the two independent parametersof the polynomial correspond to the writhe and twist contributions, separately.This new method is topologically stronger than the traditional (self-) linkingnumber method which fails to detect essential topology of knots sometimes,shedding new light upon the study of physical intercommunications ofsuperconducting cosmic strings as a complex system.

On the Expanding Configurations of Viscous Radiation Gaseous Stars:  Isentropic and Thermodynamic Models

  In this work, we study the stability of the expanding configurations forradiation gaseous stars. Such expanding configurations exist for the isentropicmodel and the thermodynamic model. In particular, we focus on the effect of themonatomic gas viscosity tensor on the expanding configurations. With respect tosmall perturbation, it is shown the self-similarly expanding homogeneoussolutions of the isentropic model is unstable, while the linearly expandinghomogeneous solutions of the isentropic model and the thermodynamic model arestable. This is an extensive study of the result in arXiv:1605.08083 by Hadzicand Jang.

Possibility of Inhomogeneous Coupling Leading to Decoherence in an  Electromagnetically-Induced-Transparency Quantum-Memory Process

  The effect of inhomogeneous coupling between three-level atoms and externallight fields is studied in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)quantum memory techqnique. By introducing a subensemble-atomic system to dealwith present inhomogeneous coupling case, we find there is a non-symmetricdark-state subspace (DSS) that allows the EIT quantum memory technique tofunction perfectly. This shows that such memory scheme can work ideally even ifthe atomic state is very far from being a symmetric one.

Classical and quantum depinning of a domain wall with a spin-polarized  current

  We study in detail the classical and quantum depinning of a domain wall (DW)induced by a fast-varying spin-polarized current. By confirming the adiabaticcondition for calculating the spin-torque in fast-varying current case, we showthat the time-dependent spin current has two critical values that determine theclassical depinning of DW. This discovery successfully explains the recentexperiments. Furthermore, a feasible way is proposed to lower the threshold ofspin currents and control the direction of DW's motion. Finally, the quantumproperties for the depinning of DW are also investigated in this paper.

Simplified amino acid alphabets based on deviation of conditional  probability from random background

  The primitive data for deducing the Miyazawa-Jernigan contact energy orBLOSUM score matrix consists of pair frequency counts. Each amino acidcorresponds to a conditional probability distribution. Based on the deviationof such conditional probability from random background, a scheme for reductionof amino acid alphabet is proposed. It is observed that evident discrepancyexists between reduced alphabets obtained from raw data of theMiyazawa-Jernigan's and BLOSUM's residue pair counts. Taking homologoussequence database SCOP40 as a test set, we detect homology with the obtainedcoarse-grained substitution matrices. It is verified that the reduced alphabetsobtained well preserve information contained in the original 20-letteralphabet.

  Resorting to the Lax matrix and elliptic variables, the discrete Chen-Lee-Liuhierarchy is decomposed into solvable ordinary differential equations. Based onthe theory of algebraic curve, the continuous flow and discrete flow related tothe discrete Chen-Lee-Liu hierarchy are straightened under the Abel-Jacobicoordinates. The meromorphic function $\phi$, the Baker-Akhiezer vector$\bar\psi $ and the hyperelliptic curve $\mathcal{K}_N$ are introduced, bywhich quasi-periodic solutions of the discrete Chen-Lee-Liu hierarchy areconstructed according to the asymptotic properties and the algebro-geometriccharacters of $\phi,\ \bar\psi $ and $\mathcal{K}_N$.

A Dynamic Algorithm for Blind Separation of Convolutive Sound Mixtures

  We study an efficient dynamic blind source separation algorithm ofconvolutive sound mixtures based on updating statistical information in thefrequency domain, andminimizing the support of time domain demixing filters bya weighted least square method. The permutation and scaling indeterminacies ofseparation, and concatenations of signals in adjacent time frames are resolvedwith optimization of $l^1 \times l^\infty$ norm on cross-correlationcoefficients at multiple time lags. The algorithm is a direct method withoutiterations, and is adaptive to the environment. Computations on recorded andsynthetic mixtures of speech and music signals show excellent performance.

On Exponential Time Lower Bound of Knapsack under Backtracking

  M.Aleknovich et al. have recently proposed a model of algorithms, called BTmodel, which generalizes both the priority model of Borodin, Nielson andRackoff, as well as a simple dynamic programming model by Woeginger. BT modelcan be further divided into three kinds of fixed, adaptive and fully adaptiveones. They have proved exponential time lower bounds of exact and approximationalgorithms under adaptive BT model for Knapsack problem. Their exact lowerbound is $\Omega(2^{0.5n}/\sqrt{n})$, in this paper, we slightly improve theexact lower bound to about $\Omega(2^{0.69n}/\sqrt{n})$, by the same technique,with related parameters optimized.

On the existence of min-max minimal torus

  In this paper, we will study the existence problem of minmax minimal torus.We use classical conformal invariant geometric variational methods. We prove atheorem about the existence of minmax minimal torus in Theorem 5.1. Firstly weprove a strong uniformization result(Proposition 3.1) using method of [1]. Thenwe use this proposition to choose good parametrization for our minmaxsequences. We prove a compactification result(Lemma 4.1) similar to that ofColding and Minicozzi [2], and then give bubbling convergence results similarto that of Ding, Li and Liu [7]. In fact, we get an approximating resultsimilar to the classical deformation lemma(Theorem 1.1).

Total coloring of pseudo-outerplanar graphs

  A graph is pseudo-outerplanar if each of its blocks has an embedding in theplane so that the vertices lie on a fixed circle and the edges lie inside thedisk of this circle with each of them crossing at most one another. In thispaper, the total coloring conjecture is completely confirmed forpseudo-outerplanar graphs. In particular, it is proved that the total chromaticnumber of every pseudo-outerplanar graph with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 5$ is$\Delta+1$.

Explicit solutions, conservation laws of the extended (2+1)-dimensional  Jaulent-Miodek equation

  By applying the direct symmetry method, the symmetry reductions and some newgroup invariant solutions were obtained, We have derived some exact solutionsby using the relationship between the new solutions and the old ones, whichinclude Weierstrass periodic solutions, elliptic periodic solutions, triangularfunction solutions and so on. Also, in order to reflect the characteristics andproperties of this solutions, we give figures of some solutions. In addition,we give the conservation laws of the extended (2+1)-dimensional Jaulent-Miodekequation. At last, we draw conclusions and discuss it.

Transitionless-based shortcuts for rapidly generating two-atom 3D  entanglement

  An experimentally feasible scheme is proposed for rapidly generating two-atomthree-dimensional (3D) entanglement with one step. As one technique ofshortcuts to adiabaticity, transitionless quantum driving is applied to speedup the adiabatic generation of two-atom 3D entanglement. Apart from the rapidrate, the scheme has much higher experimental feasibility than the recentresearch (Quant. Inf. Process. DOI: 10.1007/s11128-016-1453-2, 2016). Besides,numerical simulations indicate the scheme has strong robustness againstparameter deviations and decoherence.

Prune the Convolutional Neural Networks with Sparse Shrink

  Nowadays, it is still difficult to adapt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)based models for deployment on embedded devices. The heavy computation andlarge memory footprint of CNN models become the main burden in realapplication. In this paper, we propose a "Sparse Shrink" algorithm to prune anexisting CNN model. By analyzing the importance of each channel via sparsereconstruction, the algorithm is able to prune redundant feature mapsaccordingly. The resulting pruned model thus directly saves computationalresource. We have evaluated our algorithm on CIFAR-100. As shown in ourexperiments, we can reduce 56.77% parameters and 73.84% multiplication in totalwith only minor decrease in accuracy. These results have demonstrated theeffectiveness of our "Sparse Shrink" algorithm.

  With the nonuniform media taken into account, the nonisospectral andvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation, which describes variousphysical situations such as fluid dynamics and plasma, is under investigationin this paper. With appropriate selection of wave functions, the Darbouxtransformation is constructed, by which the multi-soliton solutions are derivedand graphs are presented. The spectral parameters, coefficients and initialphase are discussed analytically and numerically to demonstrate theirrespective effect on the soliton dynamics, which plays a role in achieving thefeasible soliton management with explicit conditions taken into account.

Accelerating Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning: Challenges and  Opportunities

  Development of machine learning (ML) workflows is a tedious process ofiterative experimentation: developers repeatedly make changes to workflowsuntil the desired accuracy is attained. We describe our vision for a"human-in-the-loop" ML system that accelerates this process: by intelligentlytracking changes and intermediate results over time, such a system can enablerapid iteration, quick responsive feedback, introspection and debugging, andbackground execution and automation. We finally describe Helix, our preliminaryattempt at such a system that has already led to speedups of up to 10x ontypical iterative workflows against competing systems.

  In this paper, nonlocal symmetries of variable coefficientAblowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur(AKNS) system are discussed for the first time. Withlax pair of time-dependent coefficient AKNS system, the nonlocal symmetries areobtained, and they are successfully localized to a Lie point symmetries byintroducing a suitable auxiliary dependent variable. Furthermore, using theobtained Lie point symmetries of closed system, we give out two types ofsymmetry reduction and explicit analytic solutions. For some interestingsolutions, the figures are given out to show their dynamic behavior.

  In this paper, nonlocal symmetries and exact solutions of variablecoefficient Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation are studied for the first time.Using pseudo-potential, high order nonlocal symmetries of time-dependentcoefficient KdV equation are obtained. In order to construct new exact analyticsolutions, new variables are introduced, which can transform nonlocalsymmetries into Lie point symmetries. Furthermore, using the Lie pointsymmetries of closed system, we give symmetry reduction and some exact analyticsolutions. For some interesting solutions, such as interaction solutions amongsolitons and other complicated waves are discussed in detail, and thecorresponding images are given to illustrate their dynamic behavior.

Superimposition-guided Facial Reconstruction from Skull

  We develop a new algorithm to perform facial reconstruction from a givenskull. This technique has forensic application in helping the identification ofskeletal remains when other information is unavailable. Unlike most existingstrategies that directly reconstruct the face from the skull, we utilize adatabase of portrait photos to create many face candidates, then perform asuperimposition to get a well matched face, and then revise it according to thesuperimposition. To support this pipeline, we build an effective autoencoderfor image-based facial reconstruction, and a generative model for constrainedface inpainting. Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed pipelineis stable and accurate.

With the help of lax pairs,nonlocal symmetries of the SWW equation are constructed which be localized by acomplicated calculation process. Furthermore, using the Lie point symmetries ofthe closed system and Schwartzian equation, some exact interaction solutionsare obtained, such as soliton-cnoidal wave solutions. Corresponding 2D and 3Dfigures are placed on illustrate dynamic behavior of the generalised variablecoefficient SWW equation.

  In this Letter, we investigate the group delay of optical pulses throughmultilayer dielectric mirrors (MDM) combined with gravitational wave (GW). Wefind that the delay increases linearly with MDM length for the transmitted wavepacket, whereas the Hartman effect disappears. Our study provides insight intothe nature of both quantum tunnelling and GW.

Genus-2 G-function for $P^1$ orbifolds

  In this paper we prove that for Gromov-Witten theory of $P^1$ orbifolds ofADE type the genus-2 G-function introduced by B. Dubrovin, S. Liu, and Y. Zhangvanishes. Together with our results in [LW], this completely solves the mainconjecture in their paper [DLZ]. In the process, we also found a sufficientcondition for the vanishing of the genus-2 G-function which is weaker than thecondition given in our previous paper [LW].

Control of Josephson current by Aharonov-Casher Phase in a Rashba Ring

  We study the interference effect induced by the Aharonov-Casher phase on theJosephson current through a semiconducting ring attached to superconductingleads. Using a 1D model that incorporates spin-orbit coupling in thesemiconducting ring, we calculate the Andreev levels analytically andnumerically, and predict oscillations of the Josephson current due to the ACphase. This result is valid from the point contact limit to the long channellength limit, as defined by the ratio of the junction length and the BCShealing length. We show in the long channel length limit that the impurityscattering has no effect on the oscillation of the Josephson current, incontrast to the case of conductivity oscillations in a spin-orbit coupled ringsystem attached to normal leads where impurity scattering reduces the amplitudeof oscillations. Our results suggest a new scheme to measure the AC phase with,in principle, higher sensitivity. In addition, this effect allows for controlof the Josephson current through the gate voltage tuned AC phase.

Spin dynamics in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime

  We study the spin dynamics in a high-mobility two dimensional electron gas(2DEG) with generic spin-orbit interactions (SOIs). We derive a set of spindynamic equations which capture the purely exponential to the dampedoscillatory spin evolution modes observed in different regimes of SOI strength.Hence we provide a full treatment of the D'yakonov-Perel's mechanism by usingthe microscopic linear response theory from the weak to the strong SOI limit.We show that the damped oscillatory modes appear when the electron scatteringtime is larger than half of the spin precession time due to the SOI, inagreement with recent observations. We propose a new way to measure thescattering time and the relative strength of Rashba and linear Dresselhaus SOIsbased on these modes and optical grating experiments. We discuss the physicalinterpretation of each of these modes in the context of Rabi oscillation.

In-plane Magnetization Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect

  In a two-dimensional electron gas, the quantized Hall conductance can beinduced by a strong magnetic field, known as the quantum Hall effect, and itcan also result from the strong exchange coupling of magnetic ions, dubbed asthe "quantum anomalous Hall effect". The quantum Hall effect requires theout-of-plane magnetic field, and similarly, it is commonly believed that themagnetization should be out-of-plane for the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Inthe present work, we find this condition is not necessary and predict that thequantum anomalous Hall effect can also be induced by the purely in-planemagnetization in two realistic systems, including Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin film withmagnetic doping and HgMnTe quantum wells with shear strains, when all thereflection symmetries are broken. An experimental setup is proposed to confirmthis effect, the observation of which will pave the way to search for thequantum anomalous Hall effect in a wider range of materials.

Long-Range Spin-Triplet Helix in Proximity Induced Superconductivity in  Spin-Orbit-Coupled Systems

  We study proximity induced triplet superconductivity in a spin-orbit-coupledsystem, and show that the \textbf{d} vector of the induced tripletsuperconductivity undergoes precession that can be controlled by varying therelative strengths of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. Inparticular, a long-range spin-triplet helix is predicted when these twospin-orbit couplings have equal strengths. We also study the Josephson junctiongeometry and show that a transition between 0 and $\pi$ junctions can beinduced by controlling the spin-orbit coupling with a gate voltage. Anexperimental setup is proposed to verify these effects. Conversely, theobservation of these effects can serve as a direct confirmation of tripletsuperconductivity.

A framework for community detection in heterogeneous multi-relational  networks

  There has been a surge of interest in community detection in homogeneoussingle-relational networks which contain only one type of nodes and edges.However, many real-world systems are naturally described as heterogeneousmulti-relational networks which contain multiple types of nodes and edges. Inthis paper, we propose a new method for detecting communities in such networks.Our method is based on optimizing the composite modularity, which is a newmodularity proposed for evaluating partitions of a heterogeneousmulti-relational network into communities. Our method is parameter-free,scalable, and suitable for various networks with general structure. Wedemonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in detectingpre-planted communities in synthetic networks. Applied to a real-world Diggnetwork, it successfully detects meaningful communities.

Majorana spintronics

  We propose a systematic magnetic-flux-free approach to detect, manipulate andbraid Majorana fermions in a semiconductor nanowire-based topological Josephsonjunction by utilizing the Majorana spin degree of freedom. We find an intrinsic$\pi$-phase difference between spin-triplet pairings enforced by the Majoranazeros modes (MZMs) at the two ends of a one-dimensional spinful topologicalsuperconductor. This $\pi$-phase is identified to be a spin-dependentsuperconducting phase, referred to as the spin-phase, which we show to betunable by controlling spin-orbit coupling strength via electric gates. Thiselectric controllable spin-phase not only affects the coupling energy betweenMZMs but also leads to a fractional Josephson effect in the absence of anyapplied magnetic flux, which enables the efficient topological qubit readout.We thus propose an all-electrically controlled superconductor-semiconductorhybrid circuit to manipulate MZMs and to detect their non-Abelian braidingstatistics properties. Our work on spin properties of topological Josephsoneffects potentially opens up a new thrust for spintronic applications withMajorana-based semiconductor quantum circuits.

Mean curvature Flow with convex Gauss image

  We study the mean curvature flow of complete space-like submanifolds inpseudo-Euclidean space with bounded Gauss image, as well as that of completesubmanifolds in Euclidean space with convex Gauss image. By using theconfinable property of the Gauss image under the mean curvature flow we provethe long time existence results in both cases. We also study the asymptoticbehavior of these solutions when $t\to\infty$.

  By using a mixture model for the density distribution of the three pseudobondangles formed by $C_\alpha$ atoms of four consecutive residues, the localstructural states are discretized as 17 conformational letters of a proteinstructural alphabet. This coarse-graining procedure converts a 3D structure toa 1D code sequence. A substitution matrix between these letters is constructedbased on the structural alignments of the FSSP database.

Generic Extensional Framework for the Memristive Systems

  Considering the over-requirement of continuity and "well-defined" confined bythe canonical framework model for memristive systems, this short paper proposesa more generic extensional framework to accommodate those discontinuity or not"well-defined" situation. In particular, two special subclasses are pointed outto fit the hitherto memristor device models.

Quantum Spin Current Induced Through Optical Fields

  We propose a scheme to generate quantum spin current via optical dipoletransition process. By coupling a three-level system based on the spin statesof charged particles (electrons or holes in semiconductor) to the angularmomentum states of the radiation, we show that a pure quantum spin current canbe generated. No spin-orbit interaction is needed in this scheme. We alsocalculate the effect of nonmagnetic impurities on the created spin currents andshow that the vertex correction of the spin hall conductivity in the ladderapproximation is exactly zero.

Two Particle States in an Asymmetric Box

  The exact two-particle energy eigenstates in an asymmetric rectangular boxwith periodic boundary conditions in all three directions are studied. Theirrelation with the elastic scattering phases of the two particles in thecontinuum are obtained. These results can be viewed as a generalization of thecorresponding formulae in a cubic box obtained by L\"uscher before. Inparticular, the s-wave scattering length is related to the energy shift in thefinite box. Possible applications of these formulae are also discussed.
