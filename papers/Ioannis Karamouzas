Universal power law governing pedestrian interactions

  Human crowds often bear a striking resemblance to interacting particlesystems, and this has prompted many researchers to describe pedestrian dynamicsin terms of interaction forces and potential energies. The correct quantitativeform of this interaction, however, has remained an open question. Here, weintroduce a novel statistical-mechanical approach to directly measure theinteraction energy between pedestrians. This analysis, when applied to a largecollection of human motion data, reveals a simple power law interaction that isbased not on the physical separation between pedestrians but on their projectedtime to a potential future collision, and is therefore fundamentallyanticipatory in nature. Remarkably, this simple law is able to describe humaninteractions across a wide variety of situations, speeds and densities. Wefurther show, through simulations, that the interaction law we identify issufficient to reproduce many known crowd phenomena.

ALAN: Adaptive Learning for Multi-Agent Navigation

  In multi-agent navigation, agents need to move towards their goal locationswhile avoiding collisions with other agents and static obstacles, often withoutcommunication with each other. Existing methods compute motions that areoptimal locally but do not account for the aggregated motions of all agents,producing inefficient global behavior especially when agents move in a crowdedspace. In this work, we develop methods to allow agents to dynamically adapttheir behavior to their local conditions. We accomplish this by formulating themulti-agent navigation problem as an action-selection problem, and propose anapproach, ALAN, that allows agents to compute time-efficient and collision-freemotions. ALAN is highly scalable because each agent makes its own decisions onhow to move using a set of velocities optimized for a variety of navigationtasks. Experimental results show that the agents using ALAN, in general, reachtheir destinations faster than using ORCA, a state-of-the-art collisionavoidance framework, the Social Forces model for pedestrian navigation, and aPredictive collision avoidance model.
