Dialogue Design and Management for Multi-Session Casual Conversation  with Older Adults

  We address the problem of designing a conversational avatar capable of asequence of casual conversations with older adults. Users at risk ofloneliness, social anxiety or a sense of ennui may benefit from practicing suchconversations in private, at their convenience. We describe an automatic spokendialogue manager for LISSA, an on-screen virtual agent that can keep olderusers involved in conversations over several sessions, each lasting 10-20minutes. The idea behind LISSA is to improve users' communication skills byproviding feedback on their non-verbal behavior at certain points in the courseof the conversations. In this paper, we analyze the dialogues collected fromthe first session between LISSA and each of 8 participants. We examine thequality of the conversations by comparing the transcripts with those collectedin a WOZ setting. LISSA's contributions to the conversations were judged byresearch assistants who rated the extent to which the contributions were"natural", "on track", "encouraging", "understanding", "relevant", and"polite". The results show that the automatic dialogue manager was able tohandle conversation with the users smoothly and naturally.
