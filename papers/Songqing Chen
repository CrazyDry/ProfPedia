Casimir Thrust Force on a Rotating Chiral Particle

  In the work, the thermal and vacuum fluctuation is predicted capable ofgenerating a Casimir thrust force on a rotating chiral particle, which willpush or pull the particle along the rotation axis. The Casimir thrust forcecomes from two origins: i) the rotation-induced symmetry-breaking in the vacuumand thermal fluctuation and ii) the chiral cross-coupling between electric andmagnetic fields and dipoles, which can convert the vacuum spin angular momentum(SAM) to the vacuum force. Using the fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT), wederive the analytical expressions for the vacuum thrust force in dipolarapproximation and the dependences of the force on rotation frequency,temperature and material optical properties are investigated. The work revealsa new mechanism to generate a vacuum force, which opens a new way to exploitzero-point energy of vacuum.
