Parallel Level set algorithm with MPI and accelerated on GPU

  Level set method has been used to capture interface motion. Narrow bandalgorithm is applied to localize the solving of level-set PDE on global domainto a tube around interface. Due to the unknown evolving interface, narrow bandalgorithm brings load balance problem for parallelizing computing. This workpresents a tool for evenly distributing work loads on CPUs. On the other hand,numerically solving level-set PDE only needs simple operations but on largegrid points. This work also presents a GPU acceleration for solving level-setPDE using finite difference method.

Intercalation driven porosity effects in coupled continuum models for  the electrical, chemical, thermal and mechanical response of battery  electrode materials

  We present a coupled continuum formulation for the electrostatic, chemical,thermal and mechanical processes in battery materials. Our treatment applies onthe macroscopic scale, at which electrodes can be modelled as porous materialsmade up of active particles held together by binders and perfused by theelectrolyte. Starting with the description common to the field, in terms ofreaction-transport partial differential equations for ions, variants of theclassical Poisson equation for electrostatics, and the heat equation, we addmechanics to the problem. Our main contribution is to model the evolution ofporosity as a consequence of strains induced by intercalation, thermalexpansion and mechanical stresses. Recognizing the potential for large localdeformations, we have settled on the finite strain framework. We present adetailed computational study of the influence of the dynamically evolvingporosity, upon ion distribution, electrostatic potential fields,charge-discharge cycles and mechanical force generated in the cell.

A multi-physics battery model with particle scale resolution of porosity  evolution driven by intercalation strain and electrolyte flow

  We present a coupled continuum formulation for the electrostatic, chemical,thermal, mechanical and fluid physics in battery materials. Our treatment is atthe particle scale, at which the active particles held together bycarbon-binders, the porous separator, current collectors and the perfusingelectrolyte are explicitly modeled. Starting with the description common to thefield, in terms of reaction-transport partial differential equations for ions,variants of the classical Poisson equation for electrostatics, and the heatequation, we introduce solid-fluid interaction to the problem. Our maincontribution is to model the electrolyte as an incompressible fluid driven byelastic, thermal and lithium intercalation strains in the active material. Ourtreatment is in the finite strain setting, and uses the ArbitraryLagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework to account for mechanical coupling of thesolid and fluid. We present a detailed computational study of the influence ofsolid-fluid interaction and magnitude of intercalation strain upon porosityevolution, ion distribution and electrostatic potential fields in the cell.

Variational system identification of the partial differential equations  governing pattern-forming physics: Inference under varying fidelity and noise

  We present a contribution to the field of system identification of partialdifferential equations (PDEs), with emphasis on discerning between competingmathematical models of pattern-forming physics. The motivation comes fromdevelopmental biology, where pattern formation is central to the development ofany multicellular organism, and from materials physics, where phase transitionssimilarly lead to microstructure. In both these fields there is a collection ofnonlinear, parabolic PDEs that, over suitable parameter intervals and regimesof physics, can resolve the patterns or microstructures with comparablefidelity. This observation frames the question of which PDE best describes thedata at hand. This question is particularly compelling because knowledge of thegoverning PDE immediately delivers insights to the physics underlying thesystems. While building on recent work that uses stepwise regression, wepresent advances that leverage the variational framework and statistical tests.We also address the influences of variable fidelity and noise in the data.

A three dimensional field formulation, and isogeometric solutions to  point and line defects using Toupin's theory of gradient elasticity at finite  strains

  We present a field formulation for defects that draws from the classicalrepresentation of the cores as force dipoles. We write these dipoles assingular distributions. Exploiting the key insight that the variational settingis the only appropriate one for the theory of distributions, we arrive atuniversally applicable weak forms for defects in nonlinear elasticity.Remarkably, the standard, Galerkin finite element method yields numericalsolutions for the elastic fields of defects that, when parameterized suitably,match very well with classical, linearized elasticity solutions. The truepotential of our approach, however, lies in its easy extension to generatesolutions to elastic fields of defects in the regime of nonlinear elasticity,and even more notably for Toupin's theory of gradient elasticity at finitestrains(Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal., 11, 385, 1962). In computing these solutions weadopt recent numerical work on an isogeometric analytic framework that enabledthe first three-dimensional solutions to general boundary value problems ofToupin's theory (Rudraraju et al. Comp. Meth. App. Mech. Engr., 278, 705,2014). We first present exhaustive solutions to point defects, edge and screwdislocations, and a study on the energetics of interacting dislocations. Then,to demonstrate the generality and potential of our treatment, we apply it toother complex dislocation configurations, including loops and low-angle grainboundaries.

Analog Circuit Applications based on Ambipolar Graphene/MoTe2 Vertical  Transistors

  The current integrated circuit (IC) technology based on conventional MOS-FET(metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) is approaching the limit ofminiaturization with increasing demand on energy. Several analog circuitapplications based on graphene FETs have been demonstrated with less componentscomparing to the conventional technology. However, low on/off current ratiocaused by the semimetal nature of graphene has severely hindered its practicalapplications. Here we report a graphene/MoTe2 van der Waals (vdW) verticaltransistor with V-shaped ambipolar field effect transfer characteristics toovercome this challenge. Investigations on temperature dependence of transportproperties reveal that gate tunable asymmetric barriers of the devices areaccount for the ambipolar behaviors. Furthermore, to demonstrate the analogcircuit applications of such vdW vertical transistors, we successfully realizedoutput polarity controllable (OPC) amplifier and frequency doubler. Theseresults enable vdW heterojunction based electronic devices to open up newpossibilities for wide perspective in telecommunication field.

Periodic elastic nanodomains in ultrathin tetrogonal-like BiFeO3 films

  We present a synchrotron grazing incidence x-ray diffraction analysis of thedomain structure and polar symmetry of highly strained BiFeO3 thin films grownon LaAlO3 substrate. We revealed the existence of periodic elastic nanodomainsin the pure tetragonal-like BFO ultrathin films down to a thickness of 6 nm. Aunique shear strain accommodation mechanism is disclosed. We furtherdemonstrated that the periodicity of the nanodomains increases with filmthickness but deviates from the classical Kittel's square root law in ultrathinthickness regime (6 - 30 nm). Temperature-dependent experiments also reveal thedisappearance of periodic modulation above 90C due to a MC-MA structural phasetransition.

Tunable hyperbolic metamaterial cavity towards few exciton strong  coupling

  We theoretically investigate coupling interaction between molecule excitonsand whispering gallery modes (WGMs) that approaches the limit of single excitonstrong coupling in hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) cavity, composed of adielectric core wrapped by several stacks of alternative layers of metal anddielectric. We demonstrate that associated with the excitation of thewhispering gallery mode, the electric fields with resonance wavelengths thatare much larger than the cavity size can be highly localized within adielectric layer, leading to extremely small mode volumes. By using temporalcoupled mode theory to model the interaction in the proposed WGMs-excitonsystem, we are able to demonstrate that the coupling between molecular excitonsand hyperbolic cavity WGMs can reach the strong coupling regime. Furthermore,we also prove that changing both the thickness of inner core and outermostlayer can lead to invariant resonance frequency while the threshold number ofcoupled excitons to fulfill the criteria for strong coupling remains ~ 4 invarious sets of tunable HMM cavities.

Optical Lattices with Higher-order Exceptional Points by Non-Hermitian  Coupling

  Exceptional points (EPs) are degeneracies in open wave systems withcoalescence of at least two energy levels and their corresponding eigenstates.In higher dimensions, more complex EP physics not found in two-state systems isobserved. We consider the emergence and interaction of multiple EPs in a fourcoupled optical waveguides system by non-Hermitian coupling showing a unique EPformation pattern in a phase diagram. In addition, absolute phase rigiditiesare computed to show the mixing of the different states in definite parameterregimes. Our results could be potentially important for developing furtherunderstanding of EP physics in higher dimensions via generalized paradigm ofnonHermitian coupling for a new generation of parity-time (PT) devices.

Generation of optical frequency comb in a chi-2 sheet micro optical  parametric oscillator via cavity phase matching

  Chi-3 micro resonators have enabled compact and portable frequency combgeneration, but require sophisticated dispersion control. Here we demonstratean alternative approach using a chi-2 sheet cavity, where the dispersionrequirement is relaxed by cavity phase matching. 21.2 THz broadband combgeneration is achieved with uniform line spacing of 133.0 GHz, despite arelatively large dispersion of 275.4 fs^2/mm around 1064nm. With 22.6 % highslope efficiency and 14.9 kW peak power handling, this chi-2 comb can befurther stabilized for navigation, telecommunication, astronomy, andspectroscopy applications.

Experimental identification of critical condition for drastically  enhancing thermoelectric power factor of two-dimensional layered materials

  Nano-structuring is an extremely promising path to high performancethermoelectrics. Favorable improvements in thermal conductivity are attainablein many material systems, and theoretical work points to large improvements inelectronic properties. However, realization of the electronic benefits inpractical materials has been elusive experimentally. A key challenge is thatexperimental identification of the quantum confinement length, below which thethermoelectric power factor is significantly enhanced, remains elusive due tolack of simultaneous control of size and carrier density. Here we investigategate tunable and temperature-dependent thermoelectric transport in $\gamma$phase indium selenide ($\gamma$ InSe, n type semiconductor) samples withthickness varying from 7 to 29 nm. This allows us to properly map out dimensionand doping space. Combining theoretical and experimental studies, we revealthat the sharper pre-edge of the conduction-band density of states arising fromquantum confinement gives rise to an enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient andthe power factor in the thinner InSe samples. Most importantly, weexperimentally identify the role of the competition between quantum confinementlength and thermal de Broglie wavelength in the enhancement of power factor.Our results provide an important and general experimental guideline foroptimizing the power factor and improving the thermoelectric performance oftwo-dimensional layered semiconductors.

Low-Symmetry Monoclinic Phases and Polarization Rotation Path Mediated  By Epitaxial Strain in Multiferroic BiFeO3 Thin Films

  A morphotropic phase boundary driven by epitaxial strain has been observed ina lead-free multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films and the strain-driven phasetransitions were widely reported to be iso-symmetric Cc-Cc ones by recentworks. In this paper, we suggest that the tetragonal-like BiFeO3 phaseidentified in epitaxial films on (001) LaAlO3 single crystal substrates ismonoclinic MC. This MC phase is different from MA type monoclinic phasereported in BiFeO3 films grown on low mismatch substrates, such as SrTiO3. Thisis confirmed not only by synchrotron x-ray studies but also by piezoresponseforce microscopy measurements. The polarization vectors of the tetragonal-likephase lie in the (100) plane, not the (110) plane as previously reported. Aphenomenological analysis was proposed to explain the formation of MC Phase.Such a low symmetry MC phase, with its linkage to MA phase and the multiphasecoexistence open an avenue for large piezoelectric response in BiFeO3 films andshed light on a complete understanding towards possible polarization rotationpaths and enhanced multiferroicity in BiFeO3 films mediated by epitaxialstrain. This work may also aid the understanding of developing new lead-freestrain-driven morphotropic phase boundary in other ferroic systems.

Optimal double resonant condition in metallic core-shell nanocavity for  third harmonic generation

  As the rapid development of nonlinear optics, the enhancement of opticalthird harmonic generation becomes a pop research realm in the fields ofphysics, chemistry, biology, materials science, information science and otherfields. In this letter, theoretical analysis on double resonance situation inmetallic core-shell nanostructure is performed in order to optimize theefficiency of third harmonic generation. As plenty of cavity modes ranging fromvisible area to near infrared can be excited efficiently in core-shellnanospheres, kinds of double resonant conditions can be formed by matching twodifferent multipolar cavity modes. Numerical simulations show that the thirdharmonic generation (THG) intensity in the far field can be enhanced remarkablywhen the THG signal couples well with the high order cavity mode. Moreimportantly, THG efficiency is optimum from the cavity on double resonantconditions coupling two modes with the same order. The THG intensity differs upto 3 magnitudes on this condition. Subsequent theoretical analysis indicatesthat changing third-order nonlinear susceptibility of the metal shell whilekeeping that of the core fixed has almost no effect on THG efficiency. Thisfinding about optimal double resonance has an appreciable effect on optimizingTHG in spherical cavity structures.

Gate-Tunable Negative Longitudinal Magnetoresistance in the Predicted  Type-II Weyl Semimetal WTe2

  The progress in exploiting new electronic materials and devices has been amajor driving force in solid-state physics. As a new state of matter, a Weylsemimetal (WSM), particularly a type-II WSM, hosts Weyl fermions as emergentquasiparticles and may harbor novel electrical transport properties because ofthe exotic Fermi surface. Nevertheless, such a type-II WSM material has notbeen experimentally observed in nature. In this work, by performing systematicmagneto-transport studies on thin films of a predicted material candidate WTe2,we observe notable angle-sensitive (between the electric and magnetic fields)negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR), which can likely be attributed tothe chiral anomaly in WSM. This phenomenon also exhibits strong planarorientation dependence with the absence of negative longitudinal MR along thetungsten chains (a axis), which is consistent with the distinctive feature of atype-II WSM. By applying a gate voltage, we demonstrate that the Fermi energycan be tuned through the Weyl points via the electric field effect; this is thefirst report of controlling the unique transport properties in situ in a WSMsystem. Our results have important implications for investigating simulatedquantum field theory in solid-state systems and may open opportunities forimplementing new types of electronic applications, such as field-effect chiralelectronic devices.

Low-Temperature Eutectic Synthesis of PtTe2 with Weak Antilocalization  and Controlled Layer Thinning

  Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have exhibited variousexotic physical properties and hold the promise of novel optoelectronic andtopological devices applications. However, the synthesis of metallic TMDs isbased on gas-phase methods and requires high temperature condition. As analternative to the gas-phase synthetic approach, lower temperature eutecticliquid-phase synthesis presents a very promising approach with the potentialfor larger-scale and controllable growth of high-quality thin metallic TMDssingle crystals. Herein, we report the first realization of low-temperatureeutectic liquid-phase synthesis of type-II Dirac semimetal PtTe2 singlecrystals with thickness ranging from 2 to 200 nm. The electrical measurement ofsynthesized PtTe2 reveals a record-high conductivity of as high as 3.3*106 S/mat room temperature. Besides, we experimentally identify the weakantilocalization behavior in the type-II Dirac semimetal PtTe2 for the firsttime. Furthermore, we develop a simple and general strategy to obtainatomically-thin PtTe2 crystal by thinning as-synthesized bulk samples, whichcan still retain highly crystalline and exhibits excellent electricconductivity. Our results of controllable and scalable low-temperature eutecticliquid-phase synthesis and layer-by-layer thinning of high-quality thin PtTe2single crystals offer a simple and general approach for obtaining differentthickness metallic TMDs with high-melting point transition metal.

Controllable Defect Driven Symmetry Change and Domain Structure  Evolution in BiFeO3 with Enhanced Tetragonality

  Defect engineering has been a powerful tool to enable the creation of exoticphases and the discovery of intriguing phenomena in ferroelectric oxides.However, accurate control the concentration of defects remains a big challenge.In this work, ion implantation, that can provide controllable point defects,allows us the ability to produce a controlled defect-driven truesuper-tetragonal (T) phase with enhanced tetragonality in ferroelectric BiFeO3thin films. This point defect engineering is found to drive the phasetransition from the as-grown mixed rhombohedral-like (R) and tetragonal-like(MC) phase to true tetragonal (T) symmetry. By further increasing the injecteddose of He ion, we demonstrate an enhanced tetragonality super-tetragonal(super-T) phase with the largest c/a ratio (~ 1.3) that has ever beenexperimentally achieved in BiFeO3. A combination of morphology change anddomain evolution further confirm that the mixed R/MC phase structure transformsto the single-domain-state true tetragonal phase. Moreover, the re-emergence ofR phase and in-plane stripe nanodomains after heat treatment reveal the memoryeffect and reversible phase transition. Our findings demonstrate the control ofR-Mc-T-super T symmetry changes and the creation of true T phase BiFeO3 withenhanced tetragonality through controllable defect engineering. This work alsoprovides a pathway to generate large tetragonality (or c/a ratio) that could beextended to other ferroelectric material systems (such as PbTiO3, BaTiO3 andHfO2) which may lead to strong polarization enhancement.
