  For autonomous Tonelli systems on $\R^n$, we develop an intrinsic proof ofthe existence of generalized characteristics using sup-convolutions. Thisapproach, together with convexity estimates for the fundamental solution, leadsto new results such as the global propagation of singularities alonggeneralized characteristics.

  In this paper, we study eigenvalues of the poly-Laplacian with arbitraryorder on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional Euclidean space and obtain alower bound for eigenvalues, which generalizes the results due to Cheng-Wei [5]and gives an improvement of results due to Cheng- Qi-Wei [3].

Growth of honeycomb-symmetrical Mn nanodots arrays on Si(111)-7*7  surface

  The growth of well-ordered Mn nanodots arrays on Si(111)-7*7 reconstructedsurface was investigated by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) aswell as Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation. Mn atoms deposited slowly ontoelevated substrates were observed to occupy preferentially on the faulted halfunit cells (FHUCs) of Si(111)-7*7 surface. The preference occupancy in theFHUCs, PF, defined as the ratio of number of FHUCs occupied by Mn nanodots tonumber of all occupied in two halves, decreases with increasing deposition rateas well as decreasing substrate temperature. The KMC simulations, which are ingood agreement with the experimental results, were employed to optimize thegrowth conditions, including deposition rate and substrate temperature, for theself-organized growth of Mn nanodots arrays on Si(111)-7*7 reconstructedsurface. By adjusting the deposition rate, one can control the growth ofwell-ordered and uniform Mn nanodots arrays to form either a triangularsymmetry or a honeycomb one.

In particular, the result of Melas is included here.

Lasry-Lions, Lax-Oleinik and Generalized characteristics

  In the recent works \cite{Cannarsa-Chen-Cheng} and \cite{Cannarsa-Cheng3}, anintrinsic approach of the propagation of singularities along the generalizedcharacteristics was obtained, even in global case, by a procedure ofsup-convolution with the kernel the fundamental solutions of the associatedHamilton-Jacobi equations.  In the present paper, we exploit the relations among Lasry-Lionsregularization, Lax-Oleinik operators (or inf/sup-convolution) and generalizedcharacteristics, which are discussed in the context of the variational settingof Tonelli Hamiltonian dynamics, such as Mather theory and weak KAM theory.

On-chip electro-optic tuning of a lithium niobate microresonator with  integrated in-plane microelectrodes

  We demonstrate electro-optic tuning of an on-chip lithium niobatemicroresonator with integrated in-plane microelectrodes. First two metallicmicroelectrodes on the substrate were formed via femtosecond laser process.Then a high-Q lithium niobate microresonator located between themicroelectrodes was fabricated by femtosecond laser direct writing accompaniedby focused ion beam milling. Due to the efficient structure designing, highelectro-optical tuning coefficient of 3.41 pm/V was observed.

Herglotz' generalized variational principle and contact type  Hamilton-Jacobi equations

  We develop an approach for the analysis of fundamental solutions toHamilton-Jacobi equations of contact type based on a generalized variationalprinciple proposed by Gustav Herglotz. We also give a quantitative Lipschitzestimate on the associated minimizers.

Vanishing contact structure problem and convergence of the viscosity  solutions

  This paper is devoted to study the vanishing contact structure problem whichis a generalization of the vanishing discount problem. Let $H^\lambda(x,p,u)$be a family of Hamiltonians of contact type with parameter $\lambda>0$ andconverges to $G(x,p)$. For the contact type Hamilton-Jacobi equation withrespect to $H^\lambda$, we prove that, under mild assumptions, the associatedviscosity solution $u^{\lambda}$ converges to a specific viscosity solution$u^0$ of the vanished contact equation. As applications, we give someconvergence results for the nonlinear vanishing discount problem.

Cheng-Weyl Vector Field and its Cosmological Application

  Weyl's idea on scale invariance was resurrected by Cheng in 1988. Therequirement of local scale invariance leads to a completely new vector field,which we call the ``Cheng-Weyl vector field''. The Cheng-Weyl vector fieldcouples only to a scalar field and the gravitational field naturally. It doesnot interact with other known matters in the standard model of particlephysics. In the present work, the (generalized) Cheng-Weyl vector field coupledwith the scalar field and its cosmological application are investigated. Amixture of the scalar field and a so-called ``cosmic triad'' of three mutuallyorthogonal Cheng-Weyl vector fields is regarded as the dark energy in theuniverse. The cosmological evolution of this ``mixed'' dark energy model isstudied. We find that the effective equation-of-state parameter of the darkenergy can cross the phantom divide $w_{de}=-1$ in some cases; the first andsecond cosmological coincidence problems can be alleviated at the same time inthis model.

Embedded constant $m^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature hypersurfaces on  spheres

  In this paper, we study $n$-dimensional hypersurfaces with constant$m^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature $H_m$ in a unit sphere $S^{n+1}(1)$ and provethat if the $m^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature $H_m$ takes value between  $\dfrac{1}{(\tan \frac{\pi}{k})^m}$ and$\frac{k^2-2}{n}(\frac{k^2+m-2}{n-m})^{\frac{m-2}{2}}$ for $1\leq m\leq n-1$and any integer $k\geq 2$, then there exists at least one $n$-dimensionalcompact nontrivial embedded hypersurface with constant $H_m>0$ in $S^{n+1}(1)$.When $m=1$, our results reduce to the results of Perdomo \cite{[P]}; when $m=2$and $m=4$, our results reduce to the results of Cheng-Li-Wei \cite{[WCL]}.

A sparse grid discontinuous Galerkin method for high-dimensional  transport equations and its application to kinetic simulations

  In this paper, we develop a sparse grid discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemefor transport equations and applied it to kinetic simulations. The method usesthe weak formulations of traditional Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) schemes forhyperbolic problems and is proven to be $L^2$ stable and convergent. A majoradvantage of the scheme lies in its low computational and storage cost due tothe employed sparse finite element approximation space. This attractive featureis explored in simulating Vlasov and Boltzmann transport equations. Goodperformance in accuracy and conservation is verified by numerical tests in upto four dimensions.

Lensless Fourier-Transform Ghost Imaging with Classical Incoherent Light

  The Fourier-Transform ghost imaging of both amplitude-only and pure-phaseobjects was experimentally observed with classical incoherent light at Fresneldistance by a new lensless scheme. The experimental results are in goodagreement with the standard Fourier-transform of the corresponding objects.This scheme provides a new route towards aberration-free diffraction-limited 3Dimages with classically incoherent thermal light, which have no resolution anddepth-of-field limitations of lens-based tomographic systems.

Interferometric characterization of pulse front tilt of spatiotemporally  focused femtosecond laser pulses for three-dimensional micromachining  application

  We report on an experimental measurement of the pulse front tilt (PFT) ofspatiotemporally focused femtosecond laser pulses in the focal plane in bothair and bulk transparent materials, which is achieved by examination of theinterference pattern between the spatiotemporally focused pulse and aconventional focused reference pulse as a function of time delay between thetwo pulses. Our simulation results agree well with the experimentalobservations.

Backward air lasing actions induced by femtosecond laser filamentation:  influence of population inversion lifetime

  We experimentally investigate generation of backward 357 nm N2 laser in a gasmixture of N2/Ar using 800-nm femtosecond laser pulses, and examine theinvolved gain dynamics based on pump-probe measurements. Our findings show thata minimum lifetime of population inversion in the excited N2 molecules isrequired for generating intense backward nitrogen lasers, which is ~0.8 nsunder our experimental conditions. The results shed new light on the mechanismfor generating intense backward lasers from ambient air, which are highly indemand for high sensitivity remote atmospheric sensing application.

Non-perturbative generation of above-threshold harmonics from  pre-excited argon atoms in intense mid-infrared laser fields

  We experimentally investigate the generation of above-threshold harmonicscompletely from argon atoms on an excited state using mid-infrared femtosecondlaser pulses. The highly nonlinear dependences of the observed signal on thepulse energy and polarization of the driver laser pulses indicate itsnon-perturbative characteristic.

Time-resolved shadowgraphs of transient plasma induced by  spatiotemporally focused femtosecond laser pulses in fused silica glass

  We report on experimental observations of formation and evolution oftransient plasma produced in fused silica glass with spatiotemporally focused(STF) femtosecond laser pulses using a pump-probe shadow imaging technique.Surprisingly, the observation shows that the track of the plasma issignificantly curved, which is attributed to an asymmetric density distributionof the transient plasma produced in the focal volume caused by the pulse fronttilt of the STF laser field.

Transverse writing of three-dimensional tubular optical waveguides in  glass with slit-shaped femtosecond laser beams

  We report on fabrication of tubular optical waveguides buried in ZBLAN glassbased on transverse femtosecond laser direct writing. Irradiation in ZBLAN withfocused femtosecond laser pulses leads to decrease of refractive index in themodified region. Tubular optical waveguides of variable mode areas arefabricated by forming the four sides of the cladding with slit-shapedfemtosecond laser pulses, ensuring single mode waveguiding with a mode fielddimension as small as ~ 4 {\mu}m.

Fabrication of polarization-independent single-mode waveguides in  lithium niobate crystal with femtosecond laser pulses

  We report on fabrication of depressed cladding optical waveguides buried inlithium niobate crystal with shaped femtosecond laser pulses. Depressedcladding waveguides of variable mode-field sizes are fabricated by forming thefour sides of the cladding using a slit-beam shaping technique. We show thatthe waveguides fabricated by our technique allows single-mode propagation ofthe light polarized in both vertical and horizontal directions.

Twisted sectors from plane partitions

  Twisted sectors arise naturally in the bosonic higher spin CFTs at their freepoints, as well as in the associated symmetric orbifolds. We identify the cosetrepresentations of the twisted sector states using the description of W_\inftyrepresentations in terms of plane partitions. We confirm these proposals by amicroscopic null-vector analysis, and by matching the excitation spectrum ofthese representations with the orbifold prediction.

High-throughput in-volume processing in glass with isotropic spatial  resolutions in three dimensions

  We report on fabrication of three dimensional (3D) microstructures in glasswith isotropic spatial resolutions. To achieve high throughput fabrication, weexpand the focal spot size with a low-numerical-aperture lens, which naturallyresults in a degraded axial resolution. We solve the problem with simultaneousspatial temporal focusing which leads to an isotropic laser-affected volumewith a spatial resolution of ~100 micron.

Monolithic integration of a high-quality factor lithium niobate  microresonator with a free-standing membrane waveguide using femtosecond  laser assisted ion beam writing (FLAIBW)

  We demonstrate integrating a high quality factor lithium niobate microdiskresonator with a free-standing membrane waveguide. Our technique is based onfemtosecond laser direct writing which produces the pre-structure, followed byfocused ion beam milling which reduces the surface roughness of sidewall of thefabricated structure to nanometer scale. Efficient light coupling between theintegrated waveguide and microdisk was achieved, and the quality factor of themicroresonator was measured as high as 1.67*10^5.

Metal surface structuring with spatiotemporally focused femtosecond  laser pulses

  Femtosecond laser micromachining provides high precision and less thermaldiffusion in surface structuring as a result of the ultrashort temporalduration and ultrahigh peak intensity of the femtosecond laser pulses. Toincrease the throughput of surface patterning, the focal spot size can beexpanded with loose focusing, which, however, could lead to nonlinearself-focusing of the pulses when the pulses propagate in air. We solve theproblem by use of spatiotemporally focused femtosecond laser pulses forablation of metal surfaces, which gives rise to improved surface quality ascompared with that obtained with the conventional focusing scheme.

Fabrication of high quality factor lithium niobate double-disk using a  femtosecond laser

  We demonstrate fabrication of a high quality factor lithium niobatedouble-disk whispering-gallery microcavity using femtosecond laser assisted ionbeam milling. Using this method, two vertically stacked 30-um-diameter diskswith a 200-nm-gap are fabricated. With our device, an optical quality factor ashigh as 1.2*10^5 is demonstrated. Our approach is scalable to fabricatemultiple disks on a single chip.

Suppression of bend loss in writing of three-dimensional optical  waveguides with femtosecond laser pulses

  We provide a solution toward compact and low-loss three dimensional (3D)photonic circuits by femtosecond laser direct writing of 3D waveguides in fusedsilica. We suppress the bend loss by sandwiching the waveguide between a pairof walls formed by internal modification of glass. Our method allows to reducethe bend loss of a curved waveguide with a bending radius of 15 mm by more thanone order of magnitude.

Aberration-free three dimensional micromachining in glass with  spatiotemporally shaped femtosecond laser pulses

  We observe that focusing a femtosecond laser beam simultaneously chirped intime and space domains in glass can efficiently suppress the optical aberrationcaused by the refractive index mismatch at the interface of air and the glasssample. We then demonstrate three dimensional microprocessing in glass with anearly invariant spatial resolution for a large range of penetration depthbetween 0.25 mm and 9 mm without any aberration correction.

Lithium niobate micro-disk resonators of quality factors above 10^7

  We report on fabrication of crystalline lithium niobate microresonators withquality factors above 10^7 as measured around 770 nm wavelength. Our techniquerelies on femtosecond laser micromachining for patterning a mask coated on thelithium niobate on insulate (LNOI) into a microdisk, followed by achemo-mechanical polishing process for transferring the disk-shaped pattern tothe LNOI. Nonlinear processes including second harmonic generation and Ramanscattering have been demonstrated in the fabricated microdisk.

High Dimensional Robust Inference for Cox Regression Models

  We consider high-dimensional inference for potentially misspecified Coxproportional hazard models based on low dimensional results by Lin and Wei[1989]. A de-sparsified Lasso estimator is proposed based on the log partiallikelihood function and shown to converge to a pseudo-true parameter vector.Interestingly, the sparsity of the true parameter can be inferred from that ofthe above limiting parameter. Moreover, each component of the above(non-sparse) estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal with a variancethat can be consistently estimated even under model misspecifications. In somecases, this asymptotic distribution leads to valid statistical inferenceprocedures, whose empirical performances are illustrated through numericalexamples.

Toward Fast and Accurate Neural Chinese Word Segmentation with  Multi-Criteria Learning

  The ambiguous annotation criteria bring into the divergence of Chinese WordSegmentation (CWS) datasets with various granularities. Multi-criteria learningleverage the annotation style of individual datasets and mine their commonbasic knowledge. In this paper, we proposed a domain adaptive segmenter tocapture diverse criteria of datasets. Our model is based on BidirectionalEncoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is responsible forintroducing external knowledge. We also optimize its computational efficiencyvia model pruning, quantization, and compiler optimization. Experiments showthat our segmenter outperforms the previous results on 10 CWS datasets and isfaster than the previous state-of-the-art Bi-LSTM-CRF model.

  In this paper, we investigate the Dirchlet eigenvalue problems ofpoly-Laplacian with any order and quadratic polynomial operator of theLaplacian. We give some estimates for lower bounds of the sums of their first$k$ eigenvalues which improve the previous results.

Homoclinic orbits and critical points of barrier functions

  We interpret the close link between the critical points of Mather's barrierfunctions and minimal homoclinic orbits with respect to the Aubry sets on$\mathbb{T}^n$. We also prove a critical point theorem for barrier functions,and the existence of such homoclinic orbits on $\mathbb{T}^2$ as anapplication.

  This paper concerns the model updating problems with no spillover of thequadratic palindromic system $P(\lambda)=\lambda^2 A^{\star}+\lambda Q+A$

On the Existence of a Closed, Embedded, Rotational  $λ$-Hypersurface

  In this paper we show the existence of a closed, embedded$\lambda$-hypersurfaces $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The hypersurface isdiffeomorhic to $\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1$and exhibits $SO(n) \times SO(n)$ symmetry. Our approach uses a "shootingmethod" similar to the approach used by McGrath in constructing a generalizedself-shrinking torus solution to mean curvature flow. The result generalizesthe $\lambda$-torus found by Cheng and Wei.

Cygnus X-1: A Spinning Black Hole?

  It has been a long-standing puzzle what triggers the spectral transitionbetween the hard and soft states in Cyg X-1. Also, the origin of the frequentlyobserved X-ray flares in the source still remains a mystery. In this paper, wewill make an attempt to address these issues in light of our recent work onblack hole spin and its observational consequences.

Embedded hypersurfaces with constant $m^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature in a  unit sphere

  In this paper, we study $n$-dimensional hypersurfaces with constant$m^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature in a unit sphere $S^{n+1}(1)$ and construct manycompact nontrivial embedded hypersurfaces with constant $m^{\text{th}}$ meancurvature $H_m>0$ in $S^{n+1}(1)$, for $1\leq m\leq n-1$. In particular, if the$4^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature $H_4$ takes value between $\dfrac{1}{(\tan\frac{\pi}{k})^4}$ and $\dfrac{k^4-4}{n(n-4)}$ for any integer $k\geq3$, thenthere exists an $n$-dimensional ($n\geq 5$) compact nontrivial embeddedhypersurface with constant $H_4$ in $S^{n+1}(1)$.

Rigidity theorems of $λ$-hypersurfaces

  Since $n$-dimensional $\lambda$-hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are critical points of the weighted area functional for the weightedvolume-preserving variations, in this paper, we study the rigidity propertiesof complete $\lambda$-hypersurfaces. We give a gap theorem of complete$\lambda$-hypersurfaces with polynomial area growth. By making use of thegeneralized maximum principle for $\mathcal L$ of $\lambda$-hypersurfaces, weprove a rigidity theorem of complete $\lambda$-hypersurfaces.

A gap for eigenvalues of a clamped plate problem

  This paper studies eigenvalues of the clamped plate problem on a boundeddomain in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We give an estimate for the gapbetween $\sqrt {\Gamma_{k+1}-\Gamma_{1}}$ and $\sqrt {\Gamma_{k}-\Gamma_{1}}$,for any positive integer $k$. According to the asymptotic formula of Agmon andPleijel, we know, the gap between $\sqrt {\Gamma_{k+1}-\Gamma_{1}}$ and $\sqrt{\Gamma_{k}-\Gamma_{1}}$ is bounded by a term with a lower order $k^{\frac1n}$in the sense of the asymptotic formula of Agmon and Peijel, where $\Gamma_j$denotes the $j^{^{\text{th}}}$ eigenvalue of the clamped plate problem.
