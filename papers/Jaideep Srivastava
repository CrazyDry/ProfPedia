Cliques in complex networks reveal link formation and community  evolution

  Missing link prediction in indirected and un-weighted network is an open andchallenge problem which has been studied intensively in recent years. In thispaper, we studied the relationships between community structure and linkformation and proposed a Fast Block probabilistic Model(FBM). In accordancewith the experiments on four real world networks, we have yielded very goodaccuracy of missing link prediction and huge improvement in computingefficiency compared to conventional methods. By analyzing the mechanism of linkformation, we also discovered that clique structure plays a significant role tohelp us understand how links grow in communities. Therefore, we summarizedthree principles which are proved to be able to well explain the mechanism oflink formation and network evolution from the theory of graph topology.

Understanding Co-evolution in Large Multi-relational Social Networks

  Understanding dynamics of evolution in large social networks is an importantproblem. In this paper, we characterize evolution in large multi-relationalsocial networks. The proliferation of online media such as Twitter, Facebook,Orkut and MMORPGs\footnote{Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Games}have created social networking data at an unprecedented scale. Sony's Everquest2 is one such example. We used game multi-relational networks to reveal thedynamics of evolution in a multi-relational setting by macroscopic study of thegame network. Macroscopic analysis involves fragmenting the network intosmaller portions for studying the dynamics within these sub-networks, referredto as `communities'. From an evolutionary perspective of multi-relationalnetwork analysis, we have made the following contributions. Specifically, weformulated and analyzed various metrics to capture evolutionary properties ofnetworks. We find that co-evolution rates in trust based `communities' areapproximately $60\%$ higher than the trade based `communities'. We also findthat the trust and trade connections within the `communities' reduce as theirsize increases. Finally, we study the interrelation between the dynamics oftrade and trust within `communities' and find interesting results about theprecursor relationship between the trade and the trust dynamics within the`communities'.

Cross-Language Domain Adaptation for Classifying Crisis-Related Short  Messages

  Rapid crisis response requires real-time analysis of messages. After adisaster happens, volunteers attempt to classify tweets to determine needs,e.g., supplies, infrastructure damage, etc. Given labeled data, supervisedmachine learning can help classify these messages. Scarcity of labeled datacauses poor performance in machine training. Can we reuse old tweets to trainclassifiers? How can we choose labeled tweets for training? Specifically, westudy the usefulness of labeled data of past events. Do labeled tweets indifferent language help? We observe the performance of our classifiers trainedusing different combinations of training sets obtained from past disasters. Weperform extensive experimentation on real crisis datasets and show that thepast labels are useful when both source and target events are of the same type(e.g. both earthquakes). For similar languages (e.g., Italian and Spanish),cross-language domain adaptation was useful, however, when for differentlanguages (e.g., Italian and English), the performance decreased.

Visualization of Wearable Data and Biometrics for Analysis and  Recommendations in Childhood Obesity

  Obesity is one of the major health risk factors be- hind the rise ofnon-communicable conditions. Understanding the factors influencing obesity isvery complex since there are many variables that can affect the healthbehaviors leading to it. Nowadays, multiple data sources can be used to studyhealth behaviors, such as wearable sensors for physical activity and sleep,social media, mobile and health data. In this paper we describe the design of adashboard for the visualization of actigraphy and biometric data from achildhood obesity camp in Qatar. This dashboard allows quantitative discoveriesthat can be used to guide patient behavior and orient qualitative research.

Impact of News Organizations' Trustworthiness and Social Media Activity  on Audience Engagement

  News organizations are increasingly using social media to reach out to theiraudience aimed at raising their attention and engagement with news. Given thecontinuous decrease in subscription rates and audience trust in news media, itis imperative for news organizations to understand factors contributing totheir relationships with the audience. Using Twitter data of 315 U.S. newspaperorganizations and their audiences, this study uses multiple regression analysisto examine the influence of key news organization characteristics on audienceengagement with news: (1) trustworthiness computed by the Trust Scores inSocial Media (TSM) algorithm; (2) quantity of tweets; and (3) skillfulness ofTwitter use. The results show significant influence of a news organizations'trustworthiness and level of Twitter activity on its audiences' newsengagement. Methods to measure trustworthiness of news organizations andaudience news engagement, as well as scalable algorithms to compute them fromlarge-scale datasets, are also proposed.

Adversarial Unsupervised Representation Learning for Activity  Time-Series

  Sufficient physical activity and restful sleep play a major role in theprevention and cure of many chronic conditions. Being able to proactivelyscreen and monitor such chronic conditions would be a big step forward foroverall health. The rapid increase in the popularity of wearable devicesprovides a significant new source, making it possible to track the user'slifestyle real-time. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervisedrepresentation learning technique called activity2vec that learns and"summarizes" the discrete-valued activity time-series. It learns therepresentations with three components: (i) the co-occurrence and magnitude ofthe activity levels in a time-segment, (ii) neighboring context of thetime-segment, and (iii) promoting subject-invariance with adversarial training.We evaluate our method on four disorder prediction tasks using linearclassifiers. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our proposed method scalesand performs better than many strong baselines. The adversarial regime helpsimprove the generalizability of our representations by promoting subjectinvariant features. We also show that using the representations at the level ofa day works the best since human activity is structured in terms of dailyroutines

Predicting Multi-actor collaborations using Hypergraphs

  Social networks are now ubiquitous and most of them contain interactionsinvolving multiple actors (groups) like author collaborations, teams or emailsin an organizations, etc. Hypergraphs are natural structures to effectivelycapture multi-actor interactions which conventional dyadic graphs fail tocapture. In this work the problem of predicting collaborations is addressedwhile modeling the collaboration network as a hypergraph network. The problemof predicting future multi-actor collaboration is mapped to hyperedgeprediction problem. Given that the higher order edge prediction is aninherently hard problem, in this work we restrict to the task of predictingedges (collaborations) that have already been observed in past. In this work,we propose a novel use of hyperincidence temporal tensors to capture timevarying hypergraphs and provides a tensor decomposition based predictionalgorithm. We quantitatively compare the performance of the hypergraphs basedapproach with the conventional dyadic graph based approach. Our hypothesis thathypergraphs preserve the information that simple graphs destroy is corroboratedby experiments using author collaboration network from the DBLP dataset. Ourresults demonstrate the strength of hypergraph based approach to predict higherorder collaborations (size>4) which is very difficult using dyadic graph basedapproach. Moreover, while predicting collaborations of size>2 hypergraphs inmost cases provide better results with an average increase of approx. 45% inF-Score for different sizes = {3,4,5,6,7}.

Predictive Overlapping Co-Clustering

  In the past few years co-clustering has emerged as an important data miningtool for two way data analysis. Co-clustering is more advantageous overtraditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as, ability to findhighly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of theoverlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extractmeaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. Forexample, building predictive models with high dimensional data andheterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from suchdata, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a moreaccurate predictive model building. Several applications such as findingpatient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups inrecommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit fromco-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data togenerate co-clusters for improved data analysis.  In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive OverlappingCo-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective andimproved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters bymaximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints onthe number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall andf-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters.Results of our algorithm has been compared with two other well-known techniques- K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over four real data set namely, Leukemia,Internet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set. The results demonstratethe effectiveness and utility of our algorithm POCC in practice.

Predicting Small Group Accretion in Social Networks: A topology based  incremental approach

  Small Group evolution has been of central importance in social sciences andalso in the industry for understanding dynamics of team formation. While mostof research works studying groups deal at a macro level with evolution ofarbitrary size communities, in this paper we restrict ourselves to studyingevolution of small group (size $\leq20$) which is governed by contrastingsociological phenomenon. Given a previous history of group collaborationbetween a set of actors, we address the problem of predicting likely futuregroup collaborations. Unfortunately, predicting groups requires choosing from$n \choose r$ possibilities (where $r$ is group size and $n$ is total number ofactors), which becomes computationally intractable as group size increases.However, our statistical analysis of a real world dataset has shown that twoprocesses: an external actor joining an existing group (incremental accretion(IA)) or collaborating with a subset of actors of an exiting group (subgroupaccretion (SA)), are largely responsible for future group formation. This helpsto drastically reduce the $n\choose r$ possibilities. We therefore, model theattachment of a group for different actors outside this group. In this paper,we have built three topology based prediction models to study these phenomena.The performance of these models is evaluated using extensive experiments overDBLP dataset. Our prediction results shows that the proposed models aresignificantly useful for future group predictions both for IA and SA.

360 Quantified Self

  Wearable devices with a wide range of sensors have contributed to the rise ofthe Quantified Self movement, where individuals log everything ranging from thenumber of steps they have taken, to their heart rate, to their sleepingpatterns. Sensors do not, however, typically sense the social and ambientenvironment of the users, such as general life style attributes or informationabout their social network. This means that the users themselves, and themedical practitioners, privy to the wearable sensor data, only have a narrowview of the individual, limited mainly to certain aspects of their physicalcondition.  In this paper we describe a number of use cases for how social media can beused to complement the check-up data and those from sensors to gain a moreholistic view on individuals' health, a perspective we call the 360 QuantifiedSelf. Health-related information can be obtained from sources as diverse asfood photo sharing, location check-ins, or profile pictures. Additionally,information from a person's ego network can shed light on the social dimensionof wellbeing which is widely acknowledged to be of utmost importance, eventhough they are currently rarely used for medical diagnosis. We articulate along-term vision describing the desirable list of technical advances andvariety of data to achieve an integrated system encompassing Electronic HealthRecords (EHR), data from wearable devices, alongside information derived fromsocial media data.

Robust Automated Human Activity Recognition and its Application to Sleep  Research

  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a powerful tool for understanding humanbehaviour. Applying HAR to wearable sensors can provide new insights byenriching the feature set in health studies, and enhance the personalisationand effectiveness of health, wellness, and fitness applications. Wearabledevices provide an unobtrusive platform for user monitoring, and due to theirincreasing market penetration, feel intrinsic to the wearer. The integration ofthese devices in daily life provide a unique opportunity for understandinghuman health and wellbeing. This is referred to as the "quantified self"movement. The analyses of complex health behaviours such as sleep,traditionally require a time-consuming manual interpretation by experts. Thismanual work is necessary due to the erratic periodicity and persistentnoisiness of human behaviour. In this paper, we present a robust automatedhuman activity recognition algorithm, which we call RAHAR. We test ouralgorithm in the application area of sleep research by providing a novelframework for evaluating sleep quality and examining the correlation betweenthe aforementioned and an individual's physical activity. Our results improvethe state-of-the-art procedure in sleep research by 15 percent for area underROC and by 30 percent for F1 score on average. However, application of RAHAR isnot limited to sleep analysis and can be used for understanding other healthproblems such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiac diseases.

Impact of Physical Activity on Sleep:A Deep Learning Based Exploration

  The importance of sleep is paramount for maintaining physical, emotional andmental wellbeing. Though the relationship between sleep and physical activityis known to be important, it is not yet fully understood. The explosion inpopularity of actigraphy and wearable devices, provides a unique opportunity tounderstand this relationship. Leveraging this information source requires newtools to be developed to facilitate data-driven research for sleep and activitypatient-recommendations.  In this paper we explore the use of deep learning to build sleep qualityprediction models based on actigraphy data. We first use deep learning as apure model building device by performing human activity recognition (HAR) onraw sensor data, and using deep learning to build sleep prediction models. Wecompare the deep learning models with those build using classical approaches,i.e. logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and adaboost.Secondly, we employ the advantage of deep learning with its ability to handlehigh dimensional datasets. We explore several deep learning models on the rawwearable sensor output without performing HAR or any other feature extraction.  Our results show that using a convolutional neural network on the rawwearables output improves the predictive value of sleep quality from physicalactivity, by an additional 8% compared to state-of-the-art non-deep learningapproaches, which itself shows a 15% improvement over current practice.Moreover, utilizing deep learning on raw data eliminates the need for datapre-processing and simplifies the overall workflow to analyze actigraphy datafor sleep and physical activity research.

The Quantified City: Sensing Dynamics in Urban Setting

  The world is witnessing a period of extreme growth and urbanization; citiesin the 21st century became nerve centers creating economic opportunities andcultural values which make cities grow exponentially. With this rapid urbanpopulation growth, city infrastructure is facing major problems, from the needto scale urban systems to sustaining the quality of services for citizen atscale. Understanding the dynamics of cities is critical towards informedstrategic urban planning. This paper showcases QuantifiedCity, a system aimedat understanding the complex dynamics taking place in cities. Often, thesedynamics involve humans, services, and infrastructures and are observed indifferent spaces: physical (IoT-based) sensing and human (social-based)sensing. The main challenges the system strives to address are related to dataintegration and fusion to enable an effective and semantically relevant datagrouping. This is achieved by considering the spatio-temporal space as ablocking function for any data generated in the city. Our system consists ofthree layer for data acquisition, data analysis, and data visualization; eachof which embeds a variety of modules to better achieve its purpose (e.g., datacrawling, data cleaning, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, named entityrecognition, event detection, time series analysis, etc.) End users can browsethe dynamics through three main dimensions: location, time, and event. For eachdimension, the system renders a set of map-centric widgets that summarize theunderlying related dynamics. This paper highlights the need for such a holisticplatform, identifies the strengths of the "Quantified City" concept, andshowcases a working demo through a real-life scenario.

Leveraging web resources for keyword assignment to short text documents

  Assigning relevant keywords to documents is very important for efficientretrieval, clustering and management of the documents. Especially with the webcorpus deluged with digital documents, automation of this task is of primeimportance. Keyword assignment is a broad topic of research which refers totagging of document with keywords, key-phrases or topics. For text documents,the keyword assignment techniques have been developed under two sub-topics:automatic keyword extraction (AKE) and automatic key-phrase abstraction.However, the approaches developed in the literature for full text documentscannot be used to assign keywords to low text content documents like twitterfeeds, news clips, product reviews or even short scholarly text. In this work,we point out several practical challenges encountered in tagging such low textcontent documents. As a solution to these challenges, we show that the proposedapproaches which leverage knowledge from several open source web resourcesenhance the quality of the tags (keywords) assigned to the low text contentdocuments. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on real worldcorpus consisting of scholarly documents with text content ranging from onlythe text in the title of the document (5-10 words) to the summary text/abstract(100- 150 words). We find that the proposed approach not just improves theaccuracy of keyword assignment but offer a computationally efficient solutionwhich can be used in real world applications.

A Structured Learning Approach with Neural Conditional Random Fields for  Sleep Staging

  Sleep plays a vital role in human health, both mental and physical. Sleepdisorders like sleep apnea are increasing in prevalence, with the rapidincrease in factors like obesity. Sleep apnea is most commonly treated withContinuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there isno mechanism to monitor a patient's progress with CPAP. Accurate detection ofsleep stages from CPAP flow signal is crucial for such a mechanism. We propose,for the first time, an automated sleep staging model based only on the flowsignal. Deep neural networks have recently shown high accuracy on sleep stagingby eliminating handcrafted features. However, these methods focus exclusivelyon extracting informative features from the input signal, without paying muchattention to the dynamics of sleep stages in the output sequence. We propose anend-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution and recurrentneural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal with astructured output layer based on a conditional random field to model thetemporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previousmethods by 10% using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleepstaging deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used toaccurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleepstages that can be deployed for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy onsleep apnea patients. Apart from the technical contributions, we expect thisstudy to motivate new research questions in sleep science.

Dynamics of Trust Reciprocation in Heterogenous MMOG Networks

  Understanding the dynamics of reciprocation is of great interest in sociologyand computational social science. The recent growth of Massively Multi-playerOnline Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale datawhich enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematicmanner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level ofreciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The tradenetwork has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obviousbarrier of requiring more goods or money for exchange; morever, there is noclear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections.The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates tosharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a highbarrier for such connections because they require faith in the players that aregranted such high access. In general, we observe that reciprocation rate isinversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note thatreciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Ourexperiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocationsto strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactionsare an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify ourhypothesis using predictive models for trust reciprocations using features fromtrade interactions. Using the number of trades (both before and after theinitial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will bereciprocated up to 11% with respect to the AUC.

Co-Morbidity Exploration on Wearables Activity Data Using Unsupervised  Pre-training and Multi-Task Learning

  Physical activity and sleep play a major role in the prevention andmanagement of many chronic conditions. It is not a trivial task to understandtheir impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic healthrecords (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapidincrease in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significantnew data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-timethrough web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider,potentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g.,sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. Thisis a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcaredecision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a newopportunity to overcome this barrier.  To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a majorfraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose anovel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learningtechnique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into accountthe co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activitypatterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost theperformance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, sincemany disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to asco-morbidity, we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the sharedstructure of disorder inducing life-style choices partially captured in thewearables data. Empirical evaluation using actigraphy data from 4,124 subjectsshows that our proposed method performs and generalizes substantially betterthan the conventional time-series symbolic representational methods andtask-specific deep learning models.
