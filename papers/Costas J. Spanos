Environmental Sensing by Wearable Device for Indoor Activity and  Location Estimation

  We present results from a set of experiments in this pilot study toinvestigate the causal influence of user activity on various environmentalparameters monitored by occupant carried multi-purpose sensors. Hypotheses withrespect to each type of measurements are verified, including temperature,humidity, and light level collected during eight typical activities: sitting inlab / cubicle, indoor walking / running, resting after physical activity,climbing stairs, taking elevators, and outdoor walking. Our main contributionis the development of features for activity and location recognition based onenvironmental measurements, which exploit location- and activity-specificcharacteristics and capture the trends resulted from the underlyingphysiological process. The features are statistically shown to have goodseparability and are also information-rich. Fusing environmental sensingtogether with acceleration is shown to achieve classification accuracy as highas 99.13%. For building applications, this study motivates a sensor fusionparadigm for learning individualized activity, location, and environmentalpreferences for energy management and user comfort.

Modeling of End-Use Energy Profile: An Appliance-Data-Driven Stochastic  Approach

  In this paper, the modeling of building end-use energy profile iscomprehensively investigated. Top-down and Bottom-up approaches are discussedwith a focus on the latter for better integration with occupant information.Compared to the Time-Of-Use (TOU) data used in previous Bottom-up models, thiswork utilizes high frequency sampled appliance power consumption data fromwireless sensor network, and hence builds an appliance-data-driven probabilitybased end-use energy profile model. ON/OFF probabilities of appliances are usedin this model, to build a non-homogeneous Markov Chain, compared to theduration statistics based model that is widely used in other works. Thesimulation results show the capability of the model to capture the diversityand variability of different categories of end-use appliance energy profile,which can further help on the design of a modern robust building power system.

Social Game for Building Energy Efficiency: Utility Learning,  Simulation, and Analysis

  We describe a social game that we designed for encouraging energy efficientbehavior amongst building occupants with the aim of reducing overall energyconsumption in the building. Occupants vote for their desired lighting leveland win points which are used in a lottery based on how far their vote is fromthe maximum setting. We assume that the occupants are utility maximizers andthat their utility functions capture the tradeoff between winning points andtheir comfort level. We model the occupants as non-cooperative agents in acontinuous game and we characterize their play using the Nash equilibriumconcept. Using occupant voting data, we parameterize their utility functionsand use a convex optimization problem to estimate the parameters. We simulatethe game defined by the estimated utility functions and show that the estimatedmodel for occupant behavior is a good predictor of their actual behavior. Inaddition, we show that due to the social game, there is a significant reductionin energy consumption.

Sequential Logistic Principal Component Analysis (SLPCA): Dimensional  Reduction in Streaming Multivariate Binary-State System

  Sequential or online dimensional reduction is of interests due to theexplosion of streaming data based applications and the requirement of adaptivestatistical modeling, in many emerging fields, such as the modeling of energyend-use profile. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is the classical way ofdimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)based PCA fails to model data which largely deviates from Gaussiandistribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve ageneralized PCA framework. If the random variable under dimensional reductionfollows Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, thegeneralized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). In this paper, we extend thebatch LPCA to a sequential version (i.e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convexoptimization theory. The convergence property of this algorithm is discussedcompared to the batch version of LPCA (i.e. BLPCA), as well as its performancein reducing the dimension for multivariate binary-state systems. Itsapplication in building energy end-use profile modeling is also investigated.

Privacy-Enhanced Architecture for Occupancy-based HVAC Control

  Large-scale sensing and actuation infrastructures have allowed buildings toachieve significant energy savings; at the same time, these technologiesintroduce significant privacy risks that must be addressed. In this paper, wepresent a framework for modeling the trade-off between improved controlperformance and increased privacy risks due to occupancy sensing. Morespecifically, we consider occupancy-based HVAC control as the control objectiveand the location traces of individual occupants as the private variables.Previous studies have shown that individual location information can beinferred from occupancy measurements. To ensure privacy, we design anarchitecture that distorts the occupancy data in order to hide individualoccupant location information while maintaining HVAC performance. Using mutualinformation between the individual's location trace and the reported occupancymeasurement as a privacy metric, we are able to optimally design a scheme tominimize privacy risk subject to a control performance guarantee. We evaluateour framework using real-world occupancy data: first, we verify that ourprivacy metric accurately assesses the adversary's ability to infer privatevariables from the distorted sensor measurements; then, we show that controlperformance is maintained through simulations of building operations usingthese distorted occupancy readings.

A Robust Utility Learning Framework via Inverse Optimization

  In many smart infrastructure applications flexibility in achievingsustainability goals can be gained by engaging end-users. However, these usersoften have heterogeneous preferences that are unknown to the decision-makertasked with improving operational efficiency. Modeling user interaction as acontinuous game between non-cooperative players, we propose a robust parametricutility learning framework that employs constrained feasible generalized leastsquares estimation with heteroskedastic inference. To improve forecastingperformance, we extend the robust utility learning scheme by employingbootstrapping with bagging, bumping, and gradient boosting ensemble methods.Moreover, we estimate the noise covariance which provides approximatedcorrelations between players which we leverage to develop a novel correlatedutility learning framework. We apply the proposed methods both to a toy examplearising from Bertrand-Nash competition between two firms as well as to datafrom a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavioramongst smart building occupants. Using occupant voting data for sharedresources such as lighting, we simulate the game defined by the estimatedutility functions to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.

Segmentation Analysis in Human Centric Cyber-Physical Systems using  Graphical Lasso

  A generalized gamification framework is introduced as a form of smartinfrastructure with potential to improve sustainability and energy efficiencyby leveraging humans-in-the-loop strategy. The proposed framework enables aHuman-Centric Cyber-Physical System using an interface to allow buildingmanagers to interact with occupants. The interface is designed for occupantengagement-integration supporting learning of their preferences over resourcesin addition to understanding how preferences change as a function of externalstimuli such as physical control, time or incentives. Towards intelligent andautonomous incentive design, a noble statistical learning algorithm performingoccupants energy usage behavior segmentation is proposed. We apply the proposedalgorithm, Graphical Lasso, on energy resource usage data by the occupants toobtain feature correlations--dependencies. Segmentation analysis results incharacteristic clusters demonstrating different energy usage behaviors. Thefeatures--factors characterizing human decision-making are made explainable.

SoundLoc: Acoustic Method for Indoor Localization without Infrastructure

  Identifying locations of occupants is beneficial to energy management inbuildings. A key observation in indoor environment is that distinct functionalareas are typically controlled by separate HVAC and lighting systems and roomlevel localization is sufficient to provide a powerful tool for energy usagereduction by occupancy-based actuation of the building facilities. Based uponthis observation, this paper focuses on identifying the room where a person ora mobile device is physically present. Existing room localization methods,however, require special infrastructure to annotate rooms.  SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsicacoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs forinfrastructures. As we show in the study, rooms' acoustic properties can becharacterized by Room Impulse Response (RIR). Nevertheless, obtaining preciseRIRs is a time-consuming and expensive process. The main contributions of ourwork are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR measurement system isimplemented and the Noise Adaptive Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithmis developed to estimate room acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second,a comprehensive physical and statistical analysis of features extracted fromRIRs is performed. Also, SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting often (10) different rooms. The overall accuracy of 97.8% achieved demonstratesthe potential to be integrated into automatic mapping of building space.

Likelihood Analysis of the pMSSM11 in Light of LHC 13-TeV Data

  We use MasterCode to perform a frequentist analysis of the constraints on aphenomenological MSSM model with 11 parameters, the pMSSM11, includingconstraints from ~ 36/fb of LHC data at 13 TeV and PICO, XENON1T and PandaX-IIsearches for dark matter scattering, as well as previous accelerator andastrophysical measurements, presenting fits both with and without the$(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint. The pMSSM11 is specified by the following parameters:3 gaugino masses $M_{1,2,3}$, a common mass for the first-and second-generationsquarks $m_{\tilde{q}}$ and a distinct third-generation squark mass$m_{\tilde{q}_3}$, a common mass for the first-and second-generation sleptons$m_{\tilde l}$ and a distinct third-generation slepton mass $m_{\tilde \tau}$,a common trilinear mixing parameter $A$, the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$, thepseudoscalar Higgs mass $M_A$ and $\tan\beta$. In the fit including$(g-2)_{\mu}$, a Bino-like $\tilde\chi^0_1$ is preferred, whereas aHiggsino-like $\tilde \chi^0_1$ is favoured when the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraintis dropped. We identify the mechanisms that operate in different regions of thepMSSM11 parameter space to bring the relic density of the lightest neutralino,$\tilde\chi^0_1$, into the range indicated by cosmological data. In the fitincluding $(g-2)_{\mu}$, coannihilations with $\tilde \chi^0_2$ and theWino-like $\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1$ or with nearly-degenerate first- andsecond-generation sleptons are favoured, whereas coannihilations with the$\tilde \chi^0_2$ and the Higgsino-like $\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1$ or with first- andsecond-generation squarks may be important when the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint isdropped. Prospects remain for discovering strongly-interacting sparticles atthe LHC as well as for discovering electroweakly-interacting sparticles at afuture linear $e^+ e^-$ collider such as the ILC or CLIC.

A Layer Correlation technique for pion energy calibration at the 2004  ATLAS Combined Beam Test

  A new method for calibrating the hadron response of a segmented calorimeteris developed and successfully applied to beam test data. It is based on aprincipal component analysis of energy deposits in the calorimeter layers,exploiting longitudinal shower development information to improve the measuredenergy resolution. Corrections for invisible hadronic energy and energy lost indead material in front of and between the calorimeters of the ATLAS experimentwere calculated with simulated Geant4 Monte Carlo events and used toreconstruct the energy of pions impinging on the calorimeters during the 2004Barrel Combined Beam Test at the CERN H8 area. For pion beams with energiesbetween 20 GeV and 180 GeV, the particle energy is reconstructed within 3% andthe energy resolution is improved by between 11% and 25% compared to theresolution at the electromagnetic scale.
