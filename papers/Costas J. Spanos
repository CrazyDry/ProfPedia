Environmental Sensing by Wearable Device for Indoor Activity and
  Location Estimation

  We present results from a set of experiments in this pilot study to
investigate the causal influence of user activity on various environmental
parameters monitored by occupant carried multi-purpose sensors. Hypotheses with
respect to each type of measurements are verified, including temperature,
humidity, and light level collected during eight typical activities: sitting in
lab / cubicle, indoor walking / running, resting after physical activity,
climbing stairs, taking elevators, and outdoor walking. Our main contribution
is the development of features for activity and location recognition based on
environmental measurements, which exploit location- and activity-specific
characteristics and capture the trends resulted from the underlying
physiological process. The features are statistically shown to have good
separability and are also information-rich. Fusing environmental sensing
together with acceleration is shown to achieve classification accuracy as high
as 99.13%. For building applications, this study motivates a sensor fusion
paradigm for learning individualized activity, location, and environmental
preferences for energy management and user comfort.


Modeling of End-Use Energy Profile: An Appliance-Data-Driven Stochastic
  Approach

  In this paper, the modeling of building end-use energy profile is
comprehensively investigated. Top-down and Bottom-up approaches are discussed
with a focus on the latter for better integration with occupant information.
Compared to the Time-Of-Use (TOU) data used in previous Bottom-up models, this
work utilizes high frequency sampled appliance power consumption data from
wireless sensor network, and hence builds an appliance-data-driven probability
based end-use energy profile model. ON/OFF probabilities of appliances are used
in this model, to build a non-homogeneous Markov Chain, compared to the
duration statistics based model that is widely used in other works. The
simulation results show the capability of the model to capture the diversity
and variability of different categories of end-use appliance energy profile,
which can further help on the design of a modern robust building power system.


A Robust Utility Learning Framework via Inverse Optimization

  In many smart infrastructure applications flexibility in achieving
sustainability goals can be gained by engaging end-users. However, these users
often have heterogeneous preferences that are unknown to the decision-maker
tasked with improving operational efficiency. Modeling user interaction as a
continuous game between non-cooperative players, we propose a robust parametric
utility learning framework that employs constrained feasible generalized least
squares estimation with heteroskedastic inference. To improve forecasting
performance, we extend the robust utility learning scheme by employing
bootstrapping with bagging, bumping, and gradient boosting ensemble methods.
Moreover, we estimate the noise covariance which provides approximated
correlations between players which we leverage to develop a novel correlated
utility learning framework. We apply the proposed methods both to a toy example
arising from Bertrand-Nash competition between two firms as well as to data
from a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavior
amongst smart building occupants. Using occupant voting data for shared
resources such as lighting, we simulate the game defined by the estimated
utility functions to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.


Social Game for Building Energy Efficiency: Utility Learning,
  Simulation, and Analysis

  We describe a social game that we designed for encouraging energy efficient
behavior amongst building occupants with the aim of reducing overall energy
consumption in the building. Occupants vote for their desired lighting level
and win points which are used in a lottery based on how far their vote is from
the maximum setting. We assume that the occupants are utility maximizers and
that their utility functions capture the tradeoff between winning points and
their comfort level. We model the occupants as non-cooperative agents in a
continuous game and we characterize their play using the Nash equilibrium
concept. Using occupant voting data, we parameterize their utility functions
and use a convex optimization problem to estimate the parameters. We simulate
the game defined by the estimated utility functions and show that the estimated
model for occupant behavior is a good predictor of their actual behavior. In
addition, we show that due to the social game, there is a significant reduction
in energy consumption.


Sequential Logistic Principal Component Analysis (SLPCA): Dimensional
  Reduction in Streaming Multivariate Binary-State System

  Sequential or online dimensional reduction is of interests due to the
explosion of streaming data based applications and the requirement of adaptive
statistical modeling, in many emerging fields, such as the modeling of energy
end-use profile. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is the classical way of
dimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
based PCA fails to model data which largely deviates from Gaussian
distribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve a
generalized PCA framework. If the random variable under dimensional reduction
follows Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, the
generalized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). In this paper, we extend the
batch LPCA to a sequential version (i.e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convex
optimization theory. The convergence property of this algorithm is discussed
compared to the batch version of LPCA (i.e. BLPCA), as well as its performance
in reducing the dimension for multivariate binary-state systems. Its
application in building energy end-use profile modeling is also investigated.


Privacy-Enhanced Architecture for Occupancy-based HVAC Control

  Large-scale sensing and actuation infrastructures have allowed buildings to
achieve significant energy savings; at the same time, these technologies
introduce significant privacy risks that must be addressed. In this paper, we
present a framework for modeling the trade-off between improved control
performance and increased privacy risks due to occupancy sensing. More
specifically, we consider occupancy-based HVAC control as the control objective
and the location traces of individual occupants as the private variables.
Previous studies have shown that individual location information can be
inferred from occupancy measurements. To ensure privacy, we design an
architecture that distorts the occupancy data in order to hide individual
occupant location information while maintaining HVAC performance. Using mutual
information between the individual's location trace and the reported occupancy
measurement as a privacy metric, we are able to optimally design a scheme to
minimize privacy risk subject to a control performance guarantee. We evaluate
our framework using real-world occupancy data: first, we verify that our
privacy metric accurately assesses the adversary's ability to infer private
variables from the distorted sensor measurements; then, we show that control
performance is maintained through simulations of building operations using
these distorted occupancy readings.


Segmentation Analysis in Human Centric Cyber-Physical Systems using
  Graphical Lasso

  A generalized gamification framework is introduced as a form of smart
infrastructure with potential to improve sustainability and energy efficiency
by leveraging humans-in-the-loop strategy. The proposed framework enables a
Human-Centric Cyber-Physical System using an interface to allow building
managers to interact with occupants. The interface is designed for occupant
engagement-integration supporting learning of their preferences over resources
in addition to understanding how preferences change as a function of external
stimuli such as physical control, time or incentives. Towards intelligent and
autonomous incentive design, a noble statistical learning algorithm performing
occupants energy usage behavior segmentation is proposed. We apply the proposed
algorithm, Graphical Lasso, on energy resource usage data by the occupants to
obtain feature correlations--dependencies. Segmentation analysis results in
characteristic clusters demonstrating different energy usage behaviors. The
features--factors characterizing human decision-making are made explainable.


SoundLoc: Acoustic Method for Indoor Localization without Infrastructure

  Identifying locations of occupants is beneficial to energy management in
buildings. A key observation in indoor environment is that distinct functional
areas are typically controlled by separate HVAC and lighting systems and room
level localization is sufficient to provide a powerful tool for energy usage
reduction by occupancy-based actuation of the building facilities. Based upon
this observation, this paper focuses on identifying the room where a person or
a mobile device is physically present. Existing room localization methods,
however, require special infrastructure to annotate rooms.
  SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic
acoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for
infrastructures. As we show in the study, rooms' acoustic properties can be
characterized by Room Impulse Response (RIR). Nevertheless, obtaining precise
RIRs is a time-consuming and expensive process. The main contributions of our
work are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR measurement system is
implemented and the Noise Adaptive Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm
is developed to estimate room acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second,
a comprehensive physical and statistical analysis of features extracted from
RIRs is performed. Also, SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting of
ten (10) different rooms. The overall accuracy of 97.8% achieved demonstrates
the potential to be integrated into automatic mapping of building space.


Likelihood Analysis of the pMSSM11 in Light of LHC 13-TeV Data

  We use MasterCode to perform a frequentist analysis of the constraints on a
phenomenological MSSM model with 11 parameters, the pMSSM11, including
constraints from ~ 36/fb of LHC data at 13 TeV and PICO, XENON1T and PandaX-II
searches for dark matter scattering, as well as previous accelerator and
astrophysical measurements, presenting fits both with and without the
$(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint. The pMSSM11 is specified by the following parameters:
3 gaugino masses $M_{1,2,3}$, a common mass for the first-and second-generation
squarks $m_{\tilde{q}}$ and a distinct third-generation squark mass
$m_{\tilde{q}_3}$, a common mass for the first-and second-generation sleptons
$m_{\tilde l}$ and a distinct third-generation slepton mass $m_{\tilde \tau}$,
a common trilinear mixing parameter $A$, the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$, the
pseudoscalar Higgs mass $M_A$ and $\tan\beta$. In the fit including
$(g-2)_{\mu}$, a Bino-like $\tilde\chi^0_1$ is preferred, whereas a
Higgsino-like $\tilde \chi^0_1$ is favoured when the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint
is dropped. We identify the mechanisms that operate in different regions of the
pMSSM11 parameter space to bring the relic density of the lightest neutralino,
$\tilde\chi^0_1$, into the range indicated by cosmological data. In the fit
including $(g-2)_{\mu}$, coannihilations with $\tilde \chi^0_2$ and the
Wino-like $\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1$ or with nearly-degenerate first- and
second-generation sleptons are favoured, whereas coannihilations with the
$\tilde \chi^0_2$ and the Higgsino-like $\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1$ or with first- and
second-generation squarks may be important when the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint is
dropped. Prospects remain for discovering strongly-interacting sparticles at
the LHC as well as for discovering electroweakly-interacting sparticles at a
future linear $e^+ e^-$ collider such as the ILC or CLIC.


A Layer Correlation technique for pion energy calibration at the 2004
  ATLAS Combined Beam Test

  A new method for calibrating the hadron response of a segmented calorimeter
is developed and successfully applied to beam test data. It is based on a
principal component analysis of energy deposits in the calorimeter layers,
exploiting longitudinal shower development information to improve the measured
energy resolution. Corrections for invisible hadronic energy and energy lost in
dead material in front of and between the calorimeters of the ATLAS experiment
were calculated with simulated Geant4 Monte Carlo events and used to
reconstruct the energy of pions impinging on the calorimeters during the 2004
Barrel Combined Beam Test at the CERN H8 area. For pion beams with energies
between 20 GeV and 180 GeV, the particle energy is reconstructed within 3% and
the energy resolution is improved by between 11% and 25% compared to the
resolution at the electromagnetic scale.


Expected Performance of the ATLAS Experiment - Detector, Trigger and
  Physics

  A detailed study is presented of the expected performance of the ATLAS
detector. The reconstruction of tracks, leptons, photons, missing energy and
jets is investigated, together with the performance of b-tagging and the
trigger. The physics potential for a variety of interesting physics processes,
within the Standard Model and beyond, is examined. The study comprises a series
of notes based on simulations of the detector and physics processes, with
particular emphasis given to the data expected from the first years of
operation of the LHC at CERN.
