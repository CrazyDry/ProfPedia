Semi-Semantic Line-Cluster Assisted Monocular SLAM for Indoor  Environments

  This paper presents a novel method to reduce the scale drift for indoormonocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We leverage the priorknowledge that in the indoor environment, the line segments form tightclusters, e.g. many door frames in a straight corridor are of the same shape,size and orientation, so the same edges of these door frames form a tight linesegment cluster. We implement our method in the popular ORB-SLAM2, which alsoserves as our baseline. In the front end we detect the line segments in eachframe and incrementally cluster them in the 3D space. In the back end, weoptimize the map imposing the constraint that the line segments of the samecluster should be the same. Experimental results show that our proposed methodsuccessfully reduces the scale drift for indoor monocular SLAM.
