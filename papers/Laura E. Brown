The First Brown Dwarf Discovered by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9
  Citizen Science Project

  The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a powerful tool for finding
nearby brown dwarfs and searching for new planets in the outer solar system,
especially with the incorporation of NEOWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation data. So
far, searches for brown dwarfs in WISE data have yet to take advantage of the
full depth of the WISE images. To efficiently search this unexplored space via
visual inspection, we have launched a new citizen science project, called
"Backyard Worlds: Planet 9," which asks volunteers to examine short animations
composed of difference images constructed from time-resolved WISE coadds. We
report the discovery of the first new substellar object found by this project,
WISEA J110125.95+540052.8, a T5.5 brown dwarf located approximately 34 pc from
the Sun with a total proper motion of $\sim$0.7 as yr$^{-1}$. WISEA
J110125.95+540052.8 has a WISE $W2$ magnitude of $W2=15.37 \pm 0.09$, this
discovery demonstrates the ability of citizen scientists to identify moving
objects via visual inspection that are 0.9 magnitudes fainter than the $W2$
single-exposure sensitivity, a threshold that has limited prior motion-based
brown dwarf searches with WISE.


HDLTex: Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text Classification

  The continually increasing number of documents produced each year
necessitates ever improving information processing methods for searching,
retrieving, and organizing text. Central to these information processing
methods is document classification, which has become an important application
for supervised learning. Recently the performance of these traditional
classifiers has degraded as the number of documents has increased. This is
because along with this growth in the number of documents has come an increase
in the number of categories. This paper approaches this problem differently
from current document classification methods that view the problem as
multi-class classification. Instead we perform hierarchical classification
using an approach we call Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text classification
(HDLTex). HDLTex employs stacks of deep learning architectures to provide
specialized understanding at each level of the document hierarchy.


RMDL: Random Multimodel Deep Learning for Classification

  The continually increasing number of complex datasets each year necessitates
ever improving machine learning methods for robust and accurate categorization
of these data. This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL): a
new ensemble, deep learning approach for classification. Deep learning models
have achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. RMDL solves the
problem of finding the best deep learning structure and architecture while
simultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep
learning architectures. RDML can accept as input a variety data to include
text, video, images, and symbolic. This paper describes RMDL and shows test
results for image and text data including MNIST, CIFAR-10, WOS, Reuters, IMDB,
and 20newsgroup. These test results show that RDML produces consistently better
performance than standard methods over a broad range of data types and
classification problems.


New Limit on the D Coefficient in Polarized Neutron Decay

  We describe an experiment that has set new limits on the time reversal
invariance violating D coefficient in neutron beta-decay. The emiT experiment
measured the angular correlation J . p_e x p_p using an octagonal symmetry that
optimizes electron-proton coincidence rates. The result is
D=[-0.6+/-1.2(stat)+/-0.5(syst)]x10^(-3). This improves constraints on the
phase of g_A/g_V and limits contributions to T violation due to leptoquarks.
This paper presents details of the experiment, data analysis, and the
investigation of systematic effects.


An Improvement of Data Classification Using Random Multimodel Deep
  Learning (RMDL)

  The exponential growth in the number of complex datasets every year requires
more enhancement in machine learning methods to provide robust and accurate
data classification. Lately, deep learning approaches have achieved surpassing
results in comparison to previous machine learning algorithms. However, finding
the suitable structure for these models has been a challenge for researchers.
This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL): a new ensemble,
deep learning approach for classification. RMDL solves the problem of finding
the best deep learning structure and architecture while simultaneously
improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep learning
architectures. In short, RMDL trains multiple randomly generated models of Deep
Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) in parallel and combines their results to produce better result
of any of those models individually. In this paper, we describe RMDL model and
compare the results for image and text classification as well as face
recognition. We used MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets as ground truth datasets for
image classification and WOS, Reuters, IMDB, and 20newsgroup datasets for text
classification. Lastly, we used ORL dataset to compare the model performance on
face recognition task.


Analysis of Railway Accidents' Narratives Using Deep Learning

  Automatic understanding of domain specific texts in order to extract useful
relationships for later use is a non-trivial task. One such relationship would
be between railroad accidents' causes and their correspondent descriptions in
reports. From 2001 to 2016 rail accidents in the U.S. cost more than $4.6B.
Railroads involved in accidents are required to submit an accident report to
the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). These reports contain a variety of
fixed field entries including primary cause of the accidents (a coded variable
with 389 values) as well as a narrative field which is a short text description
of the accident. Although these narratives provide more information than a
fixed field entry, the terminologies used in these reports are not easy to
understand by a non-expert reader. Therefore, providing an assisting method to
fill in the primary cause from such domain specific texts(narratives) would
help to label the accidents with more accuracy. Another important question for
transportation safety is whether the reported accident cause is consistent with
narrative description. To address these questions, we applied deep learning
methods together with powerful word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe to
classify accident cause values for the primary cause field using the text in
the narratives. The results show that such approaches can both accurately
classify accident causes based on report narratives and find important
inconsistencies in accident reporting.


Comment on "On the subtleties of searching for dark matter with liquid
  xenon detectors"

  In a recent manuscript (arXiv:1208.5046) Peter Sorensen claims that
XENON100's upper limits on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections for
WIMP masses below 10 GeV "may be understated by one order of magnitude or
more". Having performed a similar, though more detailed analysis prior to the
submission of our new result (arXiv:1207.5988), we do not confirm these
findings. We point out the rationale for not considering the described effect
in our final analysis and list several potential problems with his study.


Mass Loss, Destruction and Detection of Sun-grazing and -impacting
  Cometary Nuclei

  [Abridged] Sun-grazing comets almost never re-emerge, but their sublimative
destruction near the sun has only recently been observed directly, while
chromospheric impacts have not yet been seen, nor impact theory developed.
Employing simple analytic models to describe comet destruction near the Sun and
to enable the estimation of observable signatures, we find analytic solutions
for the mass as a function of distance from the Sun, for insolation
sublimation, impact ablation and explosion. Sun-grazers are found to fall into
three regimes based on initial mass and perihelion: sublimation-, ablation-,
and explosion-dominated. Most sun-grazers are destroyed sublimatively, and our
analytic results are similar to numerical models. Larger masses (>10^11g) with
small perihelion (q<1.01Rsun) ablation dominates but results are sensitive to
nucleus strength, Pc, and entry angle to the vertical, phi.
  Nuclei with initial mass >~10^10g (Pc/10^6 (dyne/cm^2) sec (phi))^3 are fully
ablated before exploding, though the hot wake itself explodes. For most
sun-impactors sec(phi)~1. For small perihelion the ablation regime applies to
moderate masses ~10^13-16 g impactors unless Pc is very low. For higher masses,
or smaller perihelia, nuclei reach higher densities where ram pressure causes
catastrophic explosion. For perihelion < 1.01Rsun, initial mass > 10^11 g
nuclei are destroyed by ablation or explosion (depending on phi and Pc) in the
chromosphere, producing flare-like events with cometary abundance spectra. For
all plausible masses and physical parameters, nuclei are destroyed above the
photosphere.


Search for Bosonic Super-WIMP Interactions with the XENON100 Experiment

  We present results of searches for vector and pseudo-scalar bosonic
super-WIMPs, which are dark matter candidates with masses at the keV-scale,
with the XENON100 experiment. XENON100 is a dual-phase xenon time projection
chamber operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. A profile
likelihood analysis of data with an exposure of 224.6 live days $\times$ 34\,kg
showed no evidence for a signal above the expected background. We thus obtain
new and stringent upper limits in the $(8-125)$\,keV/c$^2$ mass range,
excluding couplings to electrons with coupling constants of $g_{ae} >
3\times10^{-13}$ for pseudo-scalar and $\alpha'/\alpha > 2\times10^{-28}$ for
vector super-WIMPs, respectively. These limits are derived under the assumption
that super-WIMPs constitute all of the dark matter in our galaxy.


Limits on spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections from 225 live days
  of XENON100 data

  We present new experimental constraints on the elastic, spin-dependent
WIMP-nucleon cross section using recent data from the XENON100 experiment,
operated in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. An analysis of
224.6 live days x 34 kg of exposure acquired during 2011 and 2012 revealed no
excess signal due to axial-vector WIMP interactions with 129-Xe and 131-Xe
nuclei. This leads to the most stringent upper limits on WIMP-neutron cross
sections for WIMP masses above 6 GeV, with a minimum cross section of 3.5 x
10^{-40} cm^2 at a WIMP mass of 45 GeV, at 90% confidence level.


Lowering the radioactivity of the photomultiplier tubes for the XENON1T
  dark matter experiment

  The low-background, VUV-sensitive 3-inch diameter photomultiplier tube R11410
has been developed by Hamamatsu for dark matter direct detection experiments
using liquid xenon as the target material. We present the results from the
joint effort between the XENON collaboration and the Hamamatsu company to
produce a highly radio-pure photosensor (version R11410-21) for the XENON1T
dark matter experiment. After introducing the photosensor and its components,
we show the methods and results of the radioactive contamination measurements
of the individual materials employed in the photomultiplier production. We then
discuss the adopted strategies to reduce the radioactivity of the various PMT
versions. Finally, we detail the results from screening 216 tubes with
ultra-low background germanium detectors, as well as their implications for the
expected electronic and nuclear recoil background of the XENON1T experiment.


Status of NINJA: the Numerical INJection Analysis project

  The 2008 NRDA conference introduced the Numerical INJection Analysis project
(NINJA), a new collaborative effort between the numerical relativity community
and the data analysis community. NINJA focuses on modeling and searching for
gravitational wave signatures from the coalescence of binary system of compact
objects. We review the scope of this collaboration and the components of the
first NINJA project, where numerical relativity groups shared waveforms and
data analysis teams applied various techniques to detect them when embedded in
colored Gaussian noise.


An array of low-background $^3$He proportional counters for the Sudbury
  Neutrino Observatory

  An array of Neutral-Current Detectors (NCDs) has been built in order to make
a unique measurement of the total active flux of solar neutrinos in the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Data in the third phase of the SNO experiment were
collected between November 2004 and November 2006, after the NCD array was
added to improve the neutral-current sensitivity of the SNO detector. This
array consisted of 36 strings of proportional counters filled with a mixture of
$^3$He and CF$_4$ gas capable of detecting the neutrons liberated by the
neutrino-deuteron neutral current reaction in the D$_2$O, and four strings
filled with a mixture of $^4$He and CF$_4$ gas for background measurements. The
proportional counter diameter is 5 cm. The total deployed array length was 398
m. The SNO NCD array is the lowest-radioactivity large array of proportional
counters ever produced. This article describes the design, construction,
deployment, and characterization of the NCD array, discusses the electronics
and data acquisition system, and considers event signatures and backgrounds.


DARWIN: towards the ultimate dark matter detector

  DARk matter WImp search with liquid xenoN (DARWIN) will be an experiment for
the direct detection of dark matter using a multi-ton liquid xenon time
projection chamber at its core. Its primary goal will be to explore the
experimentally accessible parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs) in a wide mass-range, until neutrino interactions with the
target become an irreducible background. The prompt scintillation light and the
charge signals induced by particle interactions in the xenon will be observed
by VUV sensitive, ultra-low background photosensors. Besides its excellent
sensitivity to WIMPs above a mass of 5 GeV/c2, such a detector with its large
mass, low-energy threshold and ultra-low background level will also be
sensitive to other rare interactions. It will search for solar axions, galactic
axion-like particles and the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 136-Xe, as well
as measure the low-energy solar neutrino flux with <1% precision, observe
coherent neutrino-nucleus interactions, and detect galactic supernovae. We
present the concept of the DARWIN detector and discuss its physics reach, the
main sources of backgrounds and the ongoing detector design and R&D efforts.


Testing gravitational-wave searches with numerical relativity waveforms:
  Results from the first Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project

  The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort
between members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave data
analysis communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the sensitivity of
existing gravitational-wave search algorithms using numerically generated
waveforms and to foster closer collaboration between the numerical relativity
and data analysis communities. We describe the results of the first NINJA
analysis which focused on gravitational waveforms from binary black hole
coalescence. Ten numerical relativity groups contributed numerical data which
were used to generate a set of gravitational-wave signals. These signals were
injected into a simulated data set, designed to mimic the response of the
Initial LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Nine groups analysed this
data using search and parameter-estimation pipelines. Matched filter
algorithms, un-modelled-burst searches and Bayesian parameter-estimation and
model-selection algorithms were applied to the data. We report the efficiency
of these search methods in detecting the numerical waveforms and measuring
their parameters. We describe preliminary comparisons between the different
search methods and suggest improvements for future NINJA analyses.


The NINJA-2 catalog of hybrid post-Newtonian/numerical-relativity
  waveforms for non-precessing black-hole binaries

  The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort
between members of the numerical relativity and gravitational wave data
analysis communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the sensitivity of
existing gravitational-wave search and parameter-estimation algorithms using
numerically generated waveforms, and to foster closer collaboration between the
numerical relativity and data analysis communities. The first NINJA project
used only a small number of injections of short numerical-relativity waveforms,
which limited its ability to draw quantitative conclusions. The goal of the
NINJA-2 project is to overcome these limitations with long post-Newtonian -
numerical relativity hybrid waveforms, large numbers of injections, and the use
of real detector data. We report on the submission requirements for the NINJA-2
project and the construction of the waveform catalog. Eight numerical
relativity groups have contributed 63 hybrid waveforms consisting of a
numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to
a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. We summarize the
techniques used by each group in constructing their submissions. We also report
on the procedures used to validate these submissions, including examination in
the time and frequency domains and comparisons of waveforms from different
groups against each other. These procedures have so far considered only the
$(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode. Based on these studies we judge that the hybrid
waveforms are suitable for NINJA-2 studies. We note some of the plans for these
investigations.


Planets Around Low-Mass Stars (PALMS). V. Age-Dating Low-Mass Companions
  to Members and Interlopers of Young Moving Groups

  We present optical and near-infrared adaptive optics (AO) imaging and
spectroscopy of 13 ultracool (>M6) companions to late-type stars (K7-M4.5),
most of which have recently been identified as candidate members of nearby
young moving groups (YMGs; 8-120 Myr) in the literature. The inferred masses of
the companions (~10-100 Mjup) are highly sensitive to the ages of the primary
stars so we critically examine the kinematic and spectroscopic properties of
each system to distinguish bona fide YMG members from old field interlopers.
2MASS J02155892-0929121 C is a new M7 substellar companion (40-60 Mjup) with
clear spectroscopic signs of low gravity and hence youth. The primary, possibly
a member of the ~40 Myr Tuc-Hor moving group, is visually resolved into three
components, making it a young low-mass quadruple system in a compact (<100 AU)
configuration. In addition, Li 1 $\lambda$6708 absorption in the
intermediate-gravity M7.5 companion 2MASS J15594729+4403595 B provides
unambiguous evidence that it is young (<200 Myr) and resides below the hydrogen
burning limit. Three new close-separation (<1") companions (2MASS
J06475229-2523304 B, PYC J11519+0731 B, and GJ 4378 Ab) orbit stars previously
reported as candidate YMG members, but instead are likely old (>1 Gyr)
tidally-locked spectroscopic binaries without convincing kinematic associations
with any known moving group. The high rate of false positives in the form of
old active stars with YMG-like kinematics underscores the importance of radial
velocity and parallax measurements to validate candidate young stars identified
via proper motion and activity selection alone. Finally, we spectroscopically
confirm the cool temperature and substellar nature of HD 23514 B, a recently
discovered M8 benchmark brown dwarf orbiting the dustiest-known member of the
Pleiades. [Abridged]


The Science Case for an Extended Spitzer Mission

  Although the final observations of the Spitzer Warm Mission are currently
scheduled for March 2019, it can continue operations through the end of the
decade with no loss of photometric precision. As we will show, there is a
strong science case for extending the current Warm Mission to December 2020.
Spitzer has already made major impacts in the fields of exoplanets (including
microlensing events), characterizing near Earth objects, enhancing our
knowledge of nearby stars and brown dwarfs, understanding the properties and
structure of our Milky Way galaxy, and deep wide-field extragalactic surveys to
study galaxy birth and evolution. By extending Spitzer through 2020, it can
continue to make ground-breaking discoveries in those fields, and provide
crucial support to the NASA flagship missions JWST and WFIRST, as well as the
upcoming TESS mission, and it will complement ground-based observations by LSST
and the new large telescopes of the next decade. This scientific program
addresses NASA's Science Mission Directive's objectives in astrophysics, which
include discovering how the universe works, exploring how it began and evolved,
and searching for life on planets around other stars.


Dense matter with eXTP

  In this White Paper we present the potential of the Enhanced X-ray Timing and
Polarimetry (eXTP) mission for determining the nature of dense matter; neutron
star cores host an extreme density regime which cannot be replicated in a
terrestrial laboratory. The tightest statistical constraints on the dense
matter equation of state will come from pulse profile modelling of
accretion-powered pulsars, burst oscillation sources, and rotation-powered
pulsars. Additional constraints will derive from spin measurements, burst
spectra, and properties of the accretion flows in the vicinity of the neutron
star. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute of
High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Science, the eXTP mission is
expected to be launched in the mid 2020s.


Hitomi constraints on the 3.5 keV line in the Perseus galaxy cluster

  High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Hitomi was expected to resolve the
origin of the faint unidentified E=3.5 keV emission line reported in several
low-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as galaxies and
clusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomi
first-light observation of the Perseus cluster. The emission line expected for
Perseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under the
dark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data.
However, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously high
compared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at the
reported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertainties
for this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% significance for a
broad dark-matter line and at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas. We do not
find anomalously high fluxes of the nearby faint K line or the Ar satellite
line that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. We
do find a hint of a broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions of
Sxvi (E=3.44 keV rest-frame) -- a possible signature of charge exchange in the
molecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentified line.
While its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely to
explain the MOS signal. A confirmation of this interesting feature has to wait
for a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.


The ASTRO-H X-ray Astronomy Satellite

  The joint JAXA/NASA ASTRO-H mission is the sixth in a series of highly
successful X-ray missions developed by the Institute of Space and Astronautical
Science (ISAS), with a planned launch in 2015. The ASTRO-H mission is equipped
with a suite of sensitive instruments with the highest energy resolution ever
achieved at E > 3 keV and a wide energy range spanning four decades in energy
from soft X-rays to gamma-rays. The simultaneous broad band pass, coupled with
the high spectral resolution of Delta E < 7 eV of the micro-calorimeter, will
enable a wide variety of important science themes to be pursued. ASTRO-H is
expected to provide breakthrough results in scientific areas as diverse as the
large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution, the behavior of matter
in the gravitational strong field regime, the physical conditions in sites of
cosmic-ray acceleration, and the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters
at different redshifts.


Atmospheric gas dynamics in the Perseus cluster observed with Hitomi

  Extending the earlier measurements reported in Hitomi collaboration (2016,
Nature, 535, 117), we examine the atmospheric gas motions within the central
100~kpc of the Perseus cluster using observations obtained with the Hitomi
satellite. After correcting for the point spread function of the telescope and
using optically thin emission lines, we find that the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of the hot gas is remarkably low and mostly uniform. The velocity
dispersion reaches maxima of approximately 200~km~s$^{-1}$ toward the central
active galactic nucleus (AGN) and toward the AGN inflated north-western `ghost'
bubble. Elsewhere within the observed region, the velocity dispersion appears
constant around 100~km~s$^{-1}$. We also detect a velocity gradient with a
100~km~s$^{-1}$ amplitude across the cluster core, consistent with large-scale
sloshing of the core gas. If the observed gas motions are isotropic, the
kinetic pressure support is less than 10\% of the thermal pressure support in
the cluster core. The well-resolved optically thin emission lines have Gaussian
shapes, indicating that the turbulent driving scale is likely below 100~kpc,
which is consistent with the size of the AGN jet inflated bubbles. We also
report the first measurement of the ion temperature in the intracluster medium,
which we find to be consistent with the electron temperature. In addition, we
present a new measurement of the redshift to the brightest cluster galaxy
NGC~1275.

Search for Thermal X-ray Features from the Crab nebula with Hitomi Soft
  X-ray Spectrometer

  The Crab nebula originated from a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion
observed in 1054 A.D. When viewed as a supernova remnant (SNR), it has an
anomalously low observed ejecta mass and kinetic energy for an Fe-core collapse
SN. Intensive searches were made for a massive shell that solves this
discrepancy, but none has been detected. An alternative idea is that the SN1054
is an electron-capture (EC) explosion with a lower explosion energy by an order
of magnitude than Fe-core collapse SNe. In the X-rays, imaging searches were
performed for the plasma emission from the shell in the Crab outskirts to set a
stringent upper limit to the X-ray emitting mass. However, the extreme
brightness of the source hampers access to its vicinity. We thus employed
spectroscopic technique using the X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard the Hitomi
satellite. By exploiting its superb energy resolution, we set an upper limit
for emission or absorption features from yet undetected thermal plasma in the
2-12 keV range. We also re-evaluated the existing Chandra and XMM-Newton data.
By assembling these results, a new upper limit was obtained for the X-ray
plasma mass of <~ 1Mo for a wide range of assumed shell radius, size, and
plasma temperature both in and out of the collisional equilibrium. To compare
with the observation, we further performed hydrodynamic simulations of the Crab
SNR for two SN models (Fe-core versus EC) under two SN environments (uniform
ISM versus progenitor wind). We found that the observed mass limit can be
compatible with both SN models if the SN environment has a low density of <~
0.03 cm-3 (Fe core) or <~ 0.1 cm-3 (EC) for the uniform density, or a
progenitor wind density somewhat less than that provided by a mass loss rate of
10-5 Mo yr-1 at 20 km s-1 for the wind environment.


Measurements of resonant scattering in the Perseus cluster core with
  Hitomi SXS

  Thanks to its high spectral resolution (~5 eV at 6 keV), the Soft X-ray
Spectrometer (SXS) on board Hitomi enables us to measure the detailed structure
of spatially resolved emission lines from highly ionized ions in galaxy
clusters for the first time. In this series of papers, using the SXS we have
measured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperature
structure of the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show that
when inferring physical properties from line emissivities in systems like
Perseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken into account. In
the Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He$\alpha$ line ($w$) - the
strongest line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line is
suppressed by a factor ~1.3 in the inner ~30 kpc, compared to predictions for
an optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases with the distance from the
center. The $w$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from the
same ion. The observed distortions of the $w$ line flux, shape and distance
dependence are all consistent with the expected effect of the resonant
scattering in the Perseus core. By measuring the ratio of fluxes in optically
thick ($w$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He$\beta$, Ly$\alpha$) lines, and
comparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations, the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results are
consistent with the direct measurements of gas velocities from line broadening
described elsewhere in this series, although the systematic and statistical
uncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions of
line emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-ray
missions will enable RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on the
amplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas motions.


Hitomi Observation of Radio Galaxy NGC 1275: The First X-ray
  Microcalorimeter Spectroscopy of Fe-Kα Line Emission from an Active
  Galactic Nucleus

  The origin of the narrow Fe-K{\alpha} fluorescence line at 6.4 keV from
active galactic nuclei has long been under debate; some of the possible sites
are the outer accretion disk, the broad line region, a molecular torus, or
interstellar/intracluster media. In February-March 2016, we performed the first
X-ray microcalorimeter spectroscopy with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS)
onboard the Hitomi satellite of the Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxy NGC 1275
at the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies. With the high energy
resolution of ~5 eV at 6 keV achieved by Hitomi/SXS, we detected the
Fe-K{\alpha} line with ~5.4 {\sigma} significance. The velocity width is
constrained to be 500-1600 km s$^{-1}$ (FWHM for Gaussian models) at 90%
confidence. The SXS also constrains the continuum level from the NGC 1275
nucleus up to ~20 keV, giving an equivalent width ~20 eV of the 6.4 keV line.
Because the velocity width is narrower than that of broad H{\alpha} line of
~2750 km s$^{-1}$, we can exclude a large contribution to the line flux from
the accretion disk and the broad line region. Furthermore, we performed pixel
map analyses on the Hitomi/SXS data and image analyses on the Chandra archival
data, and revealed that the Fe-K{\alpha} line comes from a region within ~1.6
kpc from the NGC 1275 core, where an active galactic nucleus emission
dominates, rather than that from intracluster media. Therefore, we suggest that
the source of the Fe-K{\alpha} line from NGC 1275 is likely a low-covering
fraction molecular torus or a rotating molecular disk which probably extends
from a pc to hundreds pc scale in the active galactic nucleus system.


Glimpse of the highly obscured HMXB IGR J16318-4848 with Hitomi

  We report a Hitomi observation of IGR J16318-4848, a high-mass X-ray binary
system with an extremely strong absorption of N_H~10^{24} cm^{-2}. Previous
X-ray studies revealed that its spectrum is dominated by strong fluorescence
lines of Fe as well as continuum emission. For physical and geometrical insight
into the nature of the reprocessing material, we utilize the high spectroscopic
resolving power of the X-ray microcalorimeter (the soft X-ray spectrometer;
SXS) and the wide-band sensitivity by the soft and hard X-ray imager (SXI and
HXI) aboard Hitomi. Even though photon counts are limited due to unintended
off-axis pointing, the SXS spectrum resolves Fe K{\alpha_1} and K{\alpha_2}
lines and puts strong constraints on the line centroid and width. The line
width corresponds to the velocity of 160^{+300}_{-70} km s^{-1}. This
represents the most accurate, and smallest, width measurement of this line made
so far from any X-ray binary, much less than the Doppler broadening and shift
expected from speeds which are characteristic of similar systems. Combined with
the K-shell edge energy measured by the SXI and HXI spectra, the ionization
state of Fe is estimated to be in the range of Fe I--IV. Considering the
estimated ionization parameter and the distance between the X-ray source and
the absorber, the density and thickness of the materials are estimated. The
extraordinarily strong absorption and the absence of a Compton shoulder
component is confirmed. These characteristics suggest reprocessing materials
which are distributed in a narrow solid angle or scattering primarily with warm
free electrons or neutral hydrogen.


Hitomi Observations of the LMC SNR N132D: Highly Redshifted X-ray
  Emission from Iron Ejecta

  We present Hitomi observations of N132D, a young, X-ray bright, O-rich
core-collapse supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Despite a
very short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easily
detects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts in
each. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectral
resolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission is
dominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Fe
emission is highly redshifted at ~800 km/s compared to the local LMC
interstellar medium (ISM), with a 90% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if a
weakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates
(1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that these
ejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S K
velocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISM
material. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows the
He-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing the
outer shell. The results also show that even with a very small number of
counts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected in
extended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the very
low SXS background of ~1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, such
results are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similar
instruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imaging
observations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomi
and will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray Astronomy
Recovery Mission (XARM) and Athena.


Atomic data and spectral modeling constraints from high-resolution X-ray
  observations of the Perseus cluster with Hitomi

  The Hitomi SXS spectrum of the Perseus cluster, with $\sim$5 eV resolution in
the 2-9 keV band, offers an unprecedented benchmark of the atomic modeling and
database for hot collisional plasmas. It reveals both successes and challenges
of the current atomic codes. The latest versions of AtomDB/APEC (3.0.8), SPEX
(3.03.00), and CHIANTI (8.0) all provide reasonable fits to the broad-band
spectrum, and are in close agreement on best-fit temperature, emission measure,
and abundances of a few elements such as Ni. For the Fe abundance, the APEC and
SPEX measurements differ by 16%, which is 17 times higher than the statistical
uncertainty. This is mostly attributed to the differences in adopted
collisional excitation and dielectronic recombination rates of the strongest
emission lines. We further investigate and compare the sensitivity of the
derived physical parameters to the astrophysical source modeling and
instrumental effects. The Hitomi results show that an accurate atomic code is
as important as the astrophysical modeling and instrumental calibration
aspects. Substantial updates of atomic databases and targeted laboratory
measurements are needed to get the current codes ready for the data from the
next Hitomi-level mission.


Temperature Structure in the Perseus Cluster Core Observed with Hitomi

  The present paper investigates the temperature structure of the X-ray
emitting plasma in the core of the Perseus cluster using the 1.8--20.0 keV data
obtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard the Hitomi Observatory.
A series of four observations were carried out, with a total effective exposure
time of 338 ks and covering a central region $\sim7'$ in diameter. The SXS was
operated with an energy resolution of $\sim$5 eV (full width at half maximum)
at 5.9 keV. Not only fine structures of K-shell lines in He-like ions but also
transitions from higher principal quantum numbers are clearly resolved from Si
through Fe. This enables us to perform temperature diagnostics using the line
ratios of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, and to provide the first direct measurement of
the excitation temperature and ionization temperature in the Perseus cluster.
The observed spectrum is roughly reproduced by a single temperature thermal
plasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium, but detailed line ratio
diagnostics reveal slight deviations from this approximation. In particular,
the data exhibit an apparent trend of increasing ionization temperature with
increasing atomic mass, as well as small differences between the ionization and
excitation temperatures for Fe, the only element for which both temperatures
can be measured. The best-fit two-temperature models suggest a combination of 3
and 5 keV gas, which is consistent with the idea that the observed small
deviations from a single temperature approximation are due to the effects of
projection of the known radial temperature gradient in the cluster core along
the line of sight. Comparison with the Chandra/ACIS and the XMM-Newton/RGS
results on the other hand suggests that additional lower-temperature components
are present in the ICM but not detectable by Hitomi SXS given its 1.8--20 keV
energy band.


Hitomi X-ray Observation of the Pulsar Wind Nebula G21.5$-$0.9

  We present results from the Hitomi X-ray observation of a young
composite-type supernova remnant (SNR) G21.5$-$0.9, whose emission is dominated
by the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) contribution. The X-ray spectra in the 0.8-80
keV range obtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS), Soft X-ray Imager
(SXI) and Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) show a significant break in the continuum as
previously found with the NuSTAR observation. After taking into account all
known emissions from the SNR other than the PWN itself, we find that the Hitomi
spectra can be fitted with a broken power law with photon indices of
$\Gamma_1=1.74\pm0.02$ and $\Gamma_2=2.14\pm0.01$ below and above the break at
$7.1\pm0.3$ keV, which is significantly lower than the NuSTAR result ($\sim9.0$
keV). The spectral break cannot be reproduced by time-dependent particle
injection one-zone spectral energy distribution models, which strongly
indicates that a more complex emission model is needed, as suggested by recent
theoretical models. We also search for narrow emission or absorption lines with
the SXS, and perform a timing analysis of PSR J1833$-$1034 with the HXI and
SGD. No significant pulsation is found from the pulsar. However, unexpectedly,
narrow absorption line features are detected in the SXS data at 4.2345 keV and
9.296 keV with a significance of 3.65 $\sigma$. While the origin of these
features is not understood, their mere detection opens up a new field of
research and was only possible with the high resolution, sensitivity and
ability to measure extended sources provided by an X-ray microcalorimeter.


Detection of polarized gamma-ray emission from the Crab nebula with
  Hitomi Soft Gamma-ray Detector

  We present the results from the Hitomi Soft Gamma-ray Detector (SGD)
observation of the Crab nebula. The main part of SGD is a Compton camera, which
in addition to being a spectrometer, is capable of measuring polarization of
gamma-ray photons. The Crab nebula is one of the brightest X-ray / gamma-ray
sources on the sky, and, the only source from which polarized X-ray photons
have been detected. SGD observed the Crab nebula during the initial test
observation phase of Hitomi. We performed the data analysis of the SGD
observation, the SGD background estimation and the SGD Monte Carlo simulations,
and, successfully detected polarized gamma-ray emission from the Crab nebula
with only about 5 ks exposure time. The obtained polarization fraction of the
phase-integrated Crab emission (sum of pulsar and nebula emissions) is (22.1
$\pm$ 10.6)% and, the polarization angle is 110.7$^o$ + 13.2 / $-$13.0$^o$ in
the energy range of 60--160 keV (The errors correspond to the 1 sigma
deviation). The confidence level of the polarization detection was 99.3%. The
polarization angle measured by SGD is about one sigma deviation with the
projected spin axis of the pulsar, 124.0$^o$ $\pm$0.1$^o$.


An improved limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos
  from the Pierre Auger Observatory

  Neutrinos in the cosmic ray flux with energies near 1 EeV and above are
detectable with the Surface Detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We
report here on searches through Auger data from 1 January 2004 until 20 June
2013. No neutrino candidates were found, yielding a limit to the diffuse flux
of ultra-high energy neutrinos that challenges the Waxman-Bahcall bound
predictions. Neutrino identification is attempted using the broad
time-structure of the signals expected in the SD stations, and is efficiently
done for neutrinos of all flavors interacting in the atmosphere at large zenith
angles, as well as for "Earth-skimming" neutrino interactions in the case of
tau neutrinos. In this paper the searches for downward-going neutrinos in the
zenith angle bins $60^\circ-75^\circ$ and $75^\circ-90^\circ$ as well as for
upward-going neutrinos, are combined to give a single limit. The $90\%$ C.L.
single-flavor limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos with an
$E^{-2}$ spectrum in the energy range $1.0 \times 10^{17}$ eV - $2.5 \times
10^{19}$ eV is $E_\nu^2 dN_\nu/dE_\nu < 6.4 \times 10^{-9}~ {\rm GeV~ cm^{-2}~
s^{-1}~ sr^{-1}}$.


Measurement of the cosmic ray spectrum above $4{\times}10^{18}$ eV using
  inclined events detected with the Pierre Auger Observatory

  A measurement of the cosmic-ray spectrum for energies exceeding
$4{\times}10^{18}$ eV is presented, which is based on the analysis of showers
with zenith angles greater than $60^{\circ}$ detected with the Pierre Auger
Observatory between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013. The measured spectrum
confirms a flux suppression at the highest energies. Above $5.3{\times}10^{18}$
eV, the "ankle", the flux can be described by a power law $E^{-\gamma}$ with
index $\gamma=2.70 \pm 0.02 \,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.1\,\text{(sys)}$ followed by
a smooth suppression region. For the energy ($E_\text{s}$) at which the
spectral flux has fallen to one-half of its extrapolated value in the absence
of suppression, we find
$E_\text{s}=(5.12\pm0.25\,\text{(stat)}^{+1.0}_{-1.2}\,\text{(sys)}){\times}10^{19}$
eV.


The Simons Observatory: Science goals and forecasts

  The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new cosmic microwave background experiment
being built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early
2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design,
and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature and polarization
anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands: 27, 39,
93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three
small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes (SATs) and one large-aperture 6-m telescope
(LAT), with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are
to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of
relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a
cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and
constrain the duration of reionization. The SATs will target the largest
angular scales observable from Chile, mapping ~10% of the sky to a white noise
level of 2 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure the
primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, at a target level of $\sigma(r)=0.003$.
The LAT will map ~40% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expected
white noise level of 6 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands,
overlapping with the majority of the LSST sky region and partially with DESI.
With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the
Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological
parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the
microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle
polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also
provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000
extragalactic sources.


The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment: Exploring Fundamental Symmetries
  of the Universe

  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early Universe, the
dynamics of the supernova bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary for
life and whether protons eventually decay --- these mysteries at the forefront
of particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early
evolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. The
Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developed
plan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNE
is conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity
neutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream
of the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed
as a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research
Facility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine in
Lead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source at
Fermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrino
charge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yet
cost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and can
accommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptional
combination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, and
potential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facility
for the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from around
the globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year program
of exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview of
LBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physics
worldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it will
possess.


Hitomi X-ray studies of Giant Radio Pulses from the Crab pulsar

  To search for giant X-ray pulses correlated with the giant radio pulses
(GRPs) from the Crab pulsar, we performed a simultaneous observation of the
Crab pulsar with the X-ray satellite Hitomi in the 2 -- 300 keV band and the
Kashima NICT radio observatory in the 1.4 -- 1.7 GHz band with a net exposure
of about 2 ks on 25 March 2016, just before the loss of the Hitomi mission.The
timing performance of the Hitomi instruments was confirmed to meet the timing
requirement and about 1,000 and 100 GRPs were simultaneously observed at the
main and inter-pulse phases, respectively, and we found no apparent correlation
between the giant radio pulses and the X-ray emission in either the main or
inter-pulse phases.All variations are within the 2 sigma fluctuations of the
X-ray fluxes at the pulse peaks, and the 3 sigma upper limits of variations of
main- or inter- pulse GRPs are 22\% or 80\% of the peak flux in a 0.20 phase
width, respectively, in the 2 -- 300 keV band.The values become 25\% or 110\%
for main or inter-pulse GRPs, respectively, when the phase width is restricted
into the 0.03 phase.Among the upper limits from the Hitomi satellite, those in
the 4.5-10 keV and the 70-300 keV are obtained for the first time, and those in
other bands are consistent with previous reports.Numerically, the upper limits
of main- and inter-pulse GRPs in the 0.20 phase width are about (2.4 and 9.3)
$\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, respectively. No significant variability in
pulse profiles implies that the GRPs originated from a local place within the
magnetosphere and the number of photon-emitting particles temporally
increases.However, the results do not statistically rule out variations
correlated with the GRPs, because the possible X-ray enhancement may appear due
to a $>0.02$\% brightening of the pulse-peak flux under such conditions.
