The First Brown Dwarf Discovered by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9  Citizen Science Project

  The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a powerful tool for findingnearby brown dwarfs and searching for new planets in the outer solar system,especially with the incorporation of NEOWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation data. Sofar, searches for brown dwarfs in WISE data have yet to take advantage of thefull depth of the WISE images. To efficiently search this unexplored space viavisual inspection, we have launched a new citizen science project, called"Backyard Worlds: Planet 9," which asks volunteers to examine short animationscomposed of difference images constructed from time-resolved WISE coadds. Wereport the discovery of the first new substellar object found by this project,WISEA J110125.95+540052.8, a T5.5 brown dwarf located approximately 34 pc fromthe Sun with a total proper motion of $\sim$0.7 as yr$^{-1}$. WISEAJ110125.95+540052.8 has a WISE $W2$ magnitude of $W2=15.37 \pm 0.09$, thisdiscovery demonstrates the ability of citizen scientists to identify movingobjects via visual inspection that are 0.9 magnitudes fainter than the $W2$single-exposure sensitivity, a threshold that has limited prior motion-basedbrown dwarf searches with WISE.

HDLTex: Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text Classification

  The continually increasing number of documents produced each yearnecessitates ever improving information processing methods for searching,retrieving, and organizing text. Central to these information processingmethods is document classification, which has become an important applicationfor supervised learning. Recently the performance of these traditionalclassifiers has degraded as the number of documents has increased. This isbecause along with this growth in the number of documents has come an increasein the number of categories. This paper approaches this problem differentlyfrom current document classification methods that view the problem asmulti-class classification. Instead we perform hierarchical classificationusing an approach we call Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text classification(HDLTex). HDLTex employs stacks of deep learning architectures to providespecialized understanding at each level of the document hierarchy.

RMDL: Random Multimodel Deep Learning for Classification

  The continually increasing number of complex datasets each year necessitatesever improving machine learning methods for robust and accurate categorizationof these data. This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL): anew ensemble, deep learning approach for classification. Deep learning modelshave achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains. RMDL solves theproblem of finding the best deep learning structure and architecture whilesimultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deeplearning architectures. RDML can accept as input a variety data to includetext, video, images, and symbolic. This paper describes RMDL and shows testresults for image and text data including MNIST, CIFAR-10, WOS, Reuters, IMDB,and 20newsgroup. These test results show that RDML produces consistently betterperformance than standard methods over a broad range of data types andclassification problems.

New Limit on the D Coefficient in Polarized Neutron Decay

  We describe an experiment that has set new limits on the time reversalinvariance violating D coefficient in neutron beta-decay. The emiT experimentmeasured the angular correlation J . p_e x p_p using an octagonal symmetry thatoptimizes electron-proton coincidence rates. The result isD=[-0.6+/-1.2(stat)+/-0.5(syst)]x10^(-3). This improves constraints on thephase of g_A/g_V and limits contributions to T violation due to leptoquarks.This paper presents details of the experiment, data analysis, and theinvestigation of systematic effects.

An Improvement of Data Classification Using Random Multimodel Deep  Learning (RMDL)

  The exponential growth in the number of complex datasets every year requiresmore enhancement in machine learning methods to provide robust and accuratedata classification. Lately, deep learning approaches have achieved surpassingresults in comparison to previous machine learning algorithms. However, findingthe suitable structure for these models has been a challenge for researchers.This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL): a new ensemble,deep learning approach for classification. RMDL solves the problem of findingthe best deep learning structure and architecture while simultaneouslyimproving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep learningarchitectures. In short, RMDL trains multiple randomly generated models of DeepNeural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent NeuralNetwork (RNN) in parallel and combines their results to produce better resultof any of those models individually. In this paper, we describe RMDL model andcompare the results for image and text classification as well as facerecognition. We used MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets as ground truth datasets forimage classification and WOS, Reuters, IMDB, and 20newsgroup datasets for textclassification. Lastly, we used ORL dataset to compare the model performance onface recognition task.

Analysis of Railway Accidents' Narratives Using Deep Learning

  Automatic understanding of domain specific texts in order to extract usefulrelationships for later use is a non-trivial task. One such relationship wouldbe between railroad accidents' causes and their correspondent descriptions inreports. From 2001 to 2016 rail accidents in the U.S. cost more than $4.6B.Railroads involved in accidents are required to submit an accident report tothe Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). These reports contain a variety offixed field entries including primary cause of the accidents (a coded variablewith 389 values) as well as a narrative field which is a short text descriptionof the accident. Although these narratives provide more information than afixed field entry, the terminologies used in these reports are not easy tounderstand by a non-expert reader. Therefore, providing an assisting method tofill in the primary cause from such domain specific texts(narratives) wouldhelp to label the accidents with more accuracy. Another important question fortransportation safety is whether the reported accident cause is consistent withnarrative description. To address these questions, we applied deep learningmethods together with powerful word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe toclassify accident cause values for the primary cause field using the text inthe narratives. The results show that such approaches can both accuratelyclassify accident causes based on report narratives and find importantinconsistencies in accident reporting.

Comment on "On the subtleties of searching for dark matter with liquid  xenon detectors"

  In a recent manuscript (arXiv:1208.5046) Peter Sorensen claims thatXENON100's upper limits on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections forWIMP masses below 10 GeV "may be understated by one order of magnitude ormore". Having performed a similar, though more detailed analysis prior to thesubmission of our new result (arXiv:1207.5988), we do not confirm thesefindings. We point out the rationale for not considering the described effectin our final analysis and list several potential problems with his study.

Mass Loss, Destruction and Detection of Sun-grazing and -impacting  Cometary Nuclei

  [Abridged] Sun-grazing comets almost never re-emerge, but their sublimativedestruction near the sun has only recently been observed directly, whilechromospheric impacts have not yet been seen, nor impact theory developed.Employing simple analytic models to describe comet destruction near the Sun andto enable the estimation of observable signatures, we find analytic solutionsfor the mass as a function of distance from the Sun, for insolationsublimation, impact ablation and explosion. Sun-grazers are found to fall intothree regimes based on initial mass and perihelion: sublimation-, ablation-,and explosion-dominated. Most sun-grazers are destroyed sublimatively, and ouranalytic results are similar to numerical models. Larger masses (>10^11g) withsmall perihelion (q<1.01Rsun) ablation dominates but results are sensitive tonucleus strength, Pc, and entry angle to the vertical, phi.  Nuclei with initial mass >~10^10g (Pc/10^6 (dyne/cm^2) sec (phi))^3 are fullyablated before exploding, though the hot wake itself explodes. For mostsun-impactors sec(phi)~1. For small perihelion the ablation regime applies tomoderate masses ~10^13-16 g impactors unless Pc is very low. For higher masses,or smaller perihelia, nuclei reach higher densities where ram pressure causescatastrophic explosion. For perihelion < 1.01Rsun, initial mass > 10^11 gnuclei are destroyed by ablation or explosion (depending on phi and Pc) in thechromosphere, producing flare-like events with cometary abundance spectra. Forall plausible masses and physical parameters, nuclei are destroyed above thephotosphere.

Search for Bosonic Super-WIMP Interactions with the XENON100 Experiment

  We present results of searches for vector and pseudo-scalar bosonicsuper-WIMPs, which are dark matter candidates with masses at the keV-scale,with the XENON100 experiment. XENON100 is a dual-phase xenon time projectionchamber operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. A profilelikelihood analysis of data with an exposure of 224.6 live days $\times$ 34\,kgshowed no evidence for a signal above the expected background. We thus obtainnew and stringent upper limits in the $(8-125)$\,keV/c$^2$ mass range,excluding couplings to electrons with coupling constants of $g_{ae} >3\times10^{-13}$ for pseudo-scalar and $\alpha'/\alpha > 2\times10^{-28}$ forvector super-WIMPs, respectively. These limits are derived under the assumptionthat super-WIMPs constitute all of the dark matter in our galaxy.

Limits on spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections from 225 live days  of XENON100 data

  We present new experimental constraints on the elastic, spin-dependentWIMP-nucleon cross section using recent data from the XENON100 experiment,operated in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. An analysis of224.6 live days x 34 kg of exposure acquired during 2011 and 2012 revealed noexcess signal due to axial-vector WIMP interactions with 129-Xe and 131-Xenuclei. This leads to the most stringent upper limits on WIMP-neutron crosssections for WIMP masses above 6 GeV, with a minimum cross section of 3.5 x10^{-40} cm^2 at a WIMP mass of 45 GeV, at 90% confidence level.

Lowering the radioactivity of the photomultiplier tubes for the XENON1T  dark matter experiment

  The low-background, VUV-sensitive 3-inch diameter photomultiplier tube R11410has been developed by Hamamatsu for dark matter direct detection experimentsusing liquid xenon as the target material. We present the results from thejoint effort between the XENON collaboration and the Hamamatsu company toproduce a highly radio-pure photosensor (version R11410-21) for the XENON1Tdark matter experiment. After introducing the photosensor and its components,we show the methods and results of the radioactive contamination measurementsof the individual materials employed in the photomultiplier production. We thendiscuss the adopted strategies to reduce the radioactivity of the various PMTversions. Finally, we detail the results from screening 216 tubes withultra-low background germanium detectors, as well as their implications for theexpected electronic and nuclear recoil background of the XENON1T experiment.

Status of NINJA: the Numerical INJection Analysis project

  The 2008 NRDA conference introduced the Numerical INJection Analysis project(NINJA), a new collaborative effort between the numerical relativity communityand the data analysis community. NINJA focuses on modeling and searching forgravitational wave signatures from the coalescence of binary system of compactobjects. We review the scope of this collaboration and the components of thefirst NINJA project, where numerical relativity groups shared waveforms anddata analysis teams applied various techniques to detect them when embedded incolored Gaussian noise.

An array of low-background $^3$He proportional counters for the Sudbury  Neutrino Observatory

  An array of Neutral-Current Detectors (NCDs) has been built in order to makea unique measurement of the total active flux of solar neutrinos in the SudburyNeutrino Observatory (SNO). Data in the third phase of the SNO experiment werecollected between November 2004 and November 2006, after the NCD array wasadded to improve the neutral-current sensitivity of the SNO detector. Thisarray consisted of 36 strings of proportional counters filled with a mixture of$^3$He and CF$_4$ gas capable of detecting the neutrons liberated by theneutrino-deuteron neutral current reaction in the D$_2$O, and four stringsfilled with a mixture of $^4$He and CF$_4$ gas for background measurements. Theproportional counter diameter is 5 cm. The total deployed array length was 398m. The SNO NCD array is the lowest-radioactivity large array of proportionalcounters ever produced. This article describes the design, construction,deployment, and characterization of the NCD array, discusses the electronicsand data acquisition system, and considers event signatures and backgrounds.

DARWIN: towards the ultimate dark matter detector

  DARk matter WImp search with liquid xenoN (DARWIN) will be an experiment forthe direct detection of dark matter using a multi-ton liquid xenon timeprojection chamber at its core. Its primary goal will be to explore theexperimentally accessible parameter space for Weakly Interacting MassiveParticles (WIMPs) in a wide mass-range, until neutrino interactions with thetarget become an irreducible background. The prompt scintillation light and thecharge signals induced by particle interactions in the xenon will be observedby VUV sensitive, ultra-low background photosensors. Besides its excellentsensitivity to WIMPs above a mass of 5 GeV/c2, such a detector with its largemass, low-energy threshold and ultra-low background level will also besensitive to other rare interactions. It will search for solar axions, galacticaxion-like particles and the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 136-Xe, as wellas measure the low-energy solar neutrino flux with <1% precision, observecoherent neutrino-nucleus interactions, and detect galactic supernovae. Wepresent the concept of the DARWIN detector and discuss its physics reach, themain sources of backgrounds and the ongoing detector design and R&D efforts.

Testing gravitational-wave searches with numerical relativity waveforms:  Results from the first Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project

  The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effortbetween members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave dataanalysis communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the sensitivity ofexisting gravitational-wave search algorithms using numerically generatedwaveforms and to foster closer collaboration between the numerical relativityand data analysis communities. We describe the results of the first NINJAanalysis which focused on gravitational waveforms from binary black holecoalescence. Ten numerical relativity groups contributed numerical data whichwere used to generate a set of gravitational-wave signals. These signals wereinjected into a simulated data set, designed to mimic the response of theInitial LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. Nine groups analysed thisdata using search and parameter-estimation pipelines. Matched filteralgorithms, un-modelled-burst searches and Bayesian parameter-estimation andmodel-selection algorithms were applied to the data. We report the efficiencyof these search methods in detecting the numerical waveforms and measuringtheir parameters. We describe preliminary comparisons between the differentsearch methods and suggest improvements for future NINJA analyses.

The NINJA-2 catalog of hybrid post-Newtonian/numerical-relativity  waveforms for non-precessing black-hole binaries

  The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effortbetween members of the numerical relativity and gravitational wave dataanalysis communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the sensitivity ofexisting gravitational-wave search and parameter-estimation algorithms usingnumerically generated waveforms, and to foster closer collaboration between thenumerical relativity and data analysis communities. The first NINJA projectused only a small number of injections of short numerical-relativity waveforms,which limited its ability to draw quantitative conclusions. The goal of theNINJA-2 project is to overcome these limitations with long post-Newtonian -numerical relativity hybrid waveforms, large numbers of injections, and the useof real detector data. We report on the submission requirements for the NINJA-2project and the construction of the waveform catalog. Eight numericalrelativity groups have contributed 63 hybrid waveforms consisting of anumerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched toa post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. We summarize thetechniques used by each group in constructing their submissions. We also reporton the procedures used to validate these submissions, including examination inthe time and frequency domains and comparisons of waveforms from differentgroups against each other. These procedures have so far considered only the$(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode. Based on these studies we judge that the hybridwaveforms are suitable for NINJA-2 studies. We note some of the plans for theseinvestigations.

Planets Around Low-Mass Stars (PALMS). V. Age-Dating Low-Mass Companions  to Members and Interlopers of Young Moving Groups

  We present optical and near-infrared adaptive optics (AO) imaging andspectroscopy of 13 ultracool (>M6) companions to late-type stars (K7-M4.5),most of which have recently been identified as candidate members of nearbyyoung moving groups (YMGs; 8-120 Myr) in the literature. The inferred masses ofthe companions (~10-100 Mjup) are highly sensitive to the ages of the primarystars so we critically examine the kinematic and spectroscopic properties ofeach system to distinguish bona fide YMG members from old field interlopers.2MASS J02155892-0929121 C is a new M7 substellar companion (40-60 Mjup) withclear spectroscopic signs of low gravity and hence youth. The primary, possiblya member of the ~40 Myr Tuc-Hor moving group, is visually resolved into threecomponents, making it a young low-mass quadruple system in a compact (<100 AU)configuration. In addition, Li 1 $\lambda$6708 absorption in theintermediate-gravity M7.5 companion 2MASS J15594729+4403595 B providesunambiguous evidence that it is young (<200 Myr) and resides below the hydrogenburning limit. Three new close-separation (<1") companions (2MASSJ06475229-2523304 B, PYC J11519+0731 B, and GJ 4378 Ab) orbit stars previouslyreported as candidate YMG members, but instead are likely old (>1 Gyr)tidally-locked spectroscopic binaries without convincing kinematic associationswith any known moving group. The high rate of false positives in the form ofold active stars with YMG-like kinematics underscores the importance of radialvelocity and parallax measurements to validate candidate young stars identifiedvia proper motion and activity selection alone. Finally, we spectroscopicallyconfirm the cool temperature and substellar nature of HD 23514 B, a recentlydiscovered M8 benchmark brown dwarf orbiting the dustiest-known member of thePleiades.

The Science Case for an Extended Spitzer Mission

  Although the final observations of the Spitzer Warm Mission are currentlyscheduled for March 2019, it can continue operations through the end of thedecade with no loss of photometric precision. As we will show, there is astrong science case for extending the current Warm Mission to December 2020.Spitzer has already made major impacts in the fields of exoplanets (includingmicrolensing events), characterizing near Earth objects, enhancing ourknowledge of nearby stars and brown dwarfs, understanding the properties andstructure of our Milky Way galaxy, and deep wide-field extragalactic surveys tostudy galaxy birth and evolution. By extending Spitzer through 2020, it cancontinue to make ground-breaking discoveries in those fields, and providecrucial support to the NASA flagship missions JWST and WFIRST, as well as theupcoming TESS mission, and it will complement ground-based observations by LSSTand the new large telescopes of the next decade. This scientific programaddresses NASA's Science Mission Directive's objectives in astrophysics, whichinclude discovering how the universe works, exploring how it began and evolved,and searching for life on planets around other stars.

Dense matter with eXTP

  In this White Paper we present the potential of the Enhanced X-ray Timing andPolarimetry (eXTP) mission for determining the nature of dense matter; neutronstar cores host an extreme density regime which cannot be replicated in aterrestrial laboratory. The tightest statistical constraints on the densematter equation of state will come from pulse profile modelling ofaccretion-powered pulsars, burst oscillation sources, and rotation-poweredpulsars. Additional constraints will derive from spin measurements, burstspectra, and properties of the accretion flows in the vicinity of the neutronstar. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute ofHigh Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Science, the eXTP mission isexpected to be launched in the mid 2020s.

Hitomi constraints on the 3.5 keV line in the Perseus galaxy cluster

  High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Hitomi was expected to resolve theorigin of the faint unidentified E=3.5 keV emission line reported in severallow-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as galaxies andclusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomifirst-light observation of the Perseus cluster. The emission line expected forPerseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under thedark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data.However, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously highcompared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at thereported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertaintiesfor this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% significance for abroad dark-matter line and at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas. We do notfind anomalously high fluxes of the nearby faint K line or the Ar satelliteline that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. Wedo find a hint of a broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions ofSxvi (E=3.44 keV rest-frame) -- a possible signature of charge exchange in themolecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentified line.While its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely toexplain the MOS signal. A confirmation of this interesting feature has to waitfor a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.

The ASTRO-H X-ray Astronomy Satellite

  The joint JAXA/NASA ASTRO-H mission is the sixth in a series of highlysuccessful X-ray missions developed by the Institute of Space and AstronauticalScience (ISAS), with a planned launch in 2015. The ASTRO-H mission is equippedwith a suite of sensitive instruments with the highest energy resolution everachieved at E > 3 keV and a wide energy range spanning four decades in energyfrom soft X-rays to gamma-rays. The simultaneous broad band pass, coupled withthe high spectral resolution of Delta E < 7 eV of the micro-calorimeter, willenable a wide variety of important science themes to be pursued. ASTRO-H isexpected to provide breakthrough results in scientific areas as diverse as thelarge-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution, the behavior of matterin the gravitational strong field regime, the physical conditions in sites ofcosmic-ray acceleration, and the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clustersat different redshifts.

Atmospheric gas dynamics in the Perseus cluster observed with Hitomi

  Extending the earlier measurements reported in Hitomi collaboration (2016,Nature, 535, 117), we examine the atmospheric gas motions within the central100~kpc of the Perseus cluster using observations obtained with the Hitomisatellite. After correcting for the point spread function of the telescope andusing optically thin emission lines, we find that the line-of-sight velocitydispersion of the hot gas is remarkably low and mostly uniform. The velocitydispersion reaches maxima of approximately 200~km~s$^{-1}$ toward the centralactive galactic nucleus (AGN) and toward the AGN inflated north-western `ghost'bubble. Elsewhere within the observed region, the velocity dispersion appearsconstant around 100~km~s$^{-1}$. We also detect a velocity gradient with a100~km~s$^{-1}$ amplitude across the cluster core, consistent with large-scalesloshing of the core gas. If the observed gas motions are isotropic, thekinetic pressure support is less than 10\% of the thermal pressure support inthe cluster core. The well-resolved optically thin emission lines have Gaussianshapes, indicating that the turbulent driving scale is likely below 100~kpc,which is consistent with the size of the AGN jet inflated bubbles. We alsoreport the first measurement of the ion temperature in the intracluster medium,which we find to be consistent with the electron temperature. In addition, wepresent a new measurement of the redshift to the brightest cluster galaxyNGC~1275.

Search for Thermal X-ray Features from the Crab nebula with Hitomi Soft  X-ray Spectrometer

  The Crab nebula originated from a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosionobserved in 1054 A.D. When viewed as a supernova remnant (SNR), it has ananomalously low observed ejecta mass and kinetic energy for an Fe-core collapseSN. Intensive searches were made for a massive shell that solves thisdiscrepancy, but none has been detected. An alternative idea is that the SN1054is an electron-capture (EC) explosion with a lower explosion energy by an orderof magnitude than Fe-core collapse SNe. In the X-rays, imaging searches wereperformed for the plasma emission from the shell in the Crab outskirts to set astringent upper limit to the X-ray emitting mass. However, the extremebrightness of the source hampers access to its vicinity. We thus employedspectroscopic technique using the X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard the Hitomisatellite. By exploiting its superb energy resolution, we set an upper limitfor emission or absorption features from yet undetected thermal plasma in the2-12 keV range. We also re-evaluated the existing Chandra and XMM-Newton data.By assembling these results, a new upper limit was obtained for the X-rayplasma mass of <~ 1Mo for a wide range of assumed shell radius, size, andplasma temperature both in and out of the collisional equilibrium. To comparewith the observation, we further performed hydrodynamic simulations of the CrabSNR for two SN models (Fe-core versus EC) under two SN environments (uniformISM versus progenitor wind). We found that the observed mass limit can becompatible with both SN models if the SN environment has a low density of <~0.03 cm-3 (Fe core) or <~ 0.1 cm-3 (EC) for the uniform density, or aprogenitor wind density somewhat less than that provided by a mass loss rate of10-5 Mo yr-1 at 20 km s-1 for the wind environment.

Measurements of resonant scattering in the Perseus cluster core with  Hitomi SXS

  Thanks to its high spectral resolution (~5 eV at 6 keV), the Soft X-raySpectrometer (SXS) on board Hitomi enables us to measure the detailed structureof spatially resolved emission lines from highly ionized ions in galaxyclusters for the first time. In this series of papers, using the SXS we havemeasured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperaturestructure of the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show thatwhen inferring physical properties from line emissivities in systems likePerseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken into account. Inthe Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He$\alpha$ line ($w$) - thestrongest line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line issuppressed by a factor ~1.3 in the inner ~30 kpc, compared to predictions foran optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases with the distance from thecenter. The $w$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from thesame ion. The observed distortions of the $w$ line flux, shape and distancedependence are all consistent with the expected effect of the resonantscattering in the Perseus core. By measuring the ratio of fluxes in opticallythick ($w$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He$\beta$, Ly$\alpha$) lines, andcomparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfersimulations, the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results areconsistent with the direct measurements of gas velocities from line broadeningdescribed elsewhere in this series, although the systematic and statisticaluncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions ofline emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-raymissions will enable RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on theamplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas motions.

Hitomi Observation of Radio Galaxy NGC 1275: The First X-ray  Microcalorimeter Spectroscopy of Fe-Kα Line Emission from an Active  Galactic Nucleus

  The origin of the narrow Fe-K{\alpha} fluorescence line at 6.4 keV fromactive galactic nuclei has long been under debate; some of the possible sitesare the outer accretion disk, the broad line region, a molecular torus, orinterstellar/intracluster media. In February-March 2016, we performed the firstX-ray microcalorimeter spectroscopy with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS)onboard the Hitomi satellite of the Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxy NGC 1275at the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies. With the high energyresolution of ~5 eV at 6 keV achieved by Hitomi/SXS, we detected theFe-K{\alpha} line with ~5.4 {\sigma} significance. The velocity width isconstrained to be 500-1600 km s$^{-1}$ (FWHM for Gaussian models) at 90%confidence. The SXS also constrains the continuum level from the NGC 1275nucleus up to ~20 keV, giving an equivalent width ~20 eV of the 6.4 keV line.Because the velocity width is narrower than that of broad H{\alpha} line of~2750 km s$^{-1}$, we can exclude a large contribution to the line flux fromthe accretion disk and the broad line region. Furthermore, we performed pixelmap analyses on the Hitomi/SXS data and image analyses on the Chandra archivaldata, and revealed that the Fe-K{\alpha} line comes from a region within ~1.6kpc from the NGC 1275 core, where an active galactic nucleus emissiondominates, rather than that from intracluster media. Therefore, we suggest thatthe source of the Fe-K{\alpha} line from NGC 1275 is likely a low-coveringfraction molecular torus or a rotating molecular disk which probably extendsfrom a pc to hundreds pc scale in the active galactic nucleus system.

Glimpse of the highly obscured HMXB IGR J16318-4848 with Hitomi

  We report a Hitomi observation of IGR J16318-4848, a high-mass X-ray binarysystem with an extremely strong absorption of N_H~10^{24} cm^{-2}. PreviousX-ray studies revealed that its spectrum is dominated by strong fluorescencelines of Fe as well as continuum emission. For physical and geometrical insightinto the nature of the reprocessing material, we utilize the high spectroscopicresolving power of the X-ray microcalorimeter (the soft X-ray spectrometer;SXS) and the wide-band sensitivity by the soft and hard X-ray imager (SXI andHXI) aboard Hitomi. Even though photon counts are limited due to unintendedoff-axis pointing, the SXS spectrum resolves Fe K{\alpha_1} and K{\alpha_2}lines and puts strong constraints on the line centroid and width. The linewidth corresponds to the velocity of 160^{+300}_{-70} km s^{-1}. Thisrepresents the most accurate, and smallest, width measurement of this line madeso far from any X-ray binary, much less than the Doppler broadening and shiftexpected from speeds which are characteristic of similar systems. Combined withthe K-shell edge energy measured by the SXI and HXI spectra, the ionizationstate of Fe is estimated to be in the range of Fe I--IV. Considering theestimated ionization parameter and the distance between the X-ray source andthe absorber, the density and thickness of the materials are estimated. Theextraordinarily strong absorption and the absence of a Compton shouldercomponent is confirmed. These characteristics suggest reprocessing materialswhich are distributed in a narrow solid angle or scattering primarily with warmfree electrons or neutral hydrogen.

Hitomi Observations of the LMC SNR N132D: Highly Redshifted X-ray  Emission from Iron Ejecta

  We present Hitomi observations of N132D, a young, X-ray bright, O-richcore-collapse supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Despite avery short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easilydetects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts ineach. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectralresolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission isdominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Feemission is highly redshifted at ~800 km/s compared to the local LMCinterstellar medium (ISM), with a 90% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if aweakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates(1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that theseejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S Kvelocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISMmaterial. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows theHe-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing theouter shell. The results also show that even with a very small number ofcounts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected inextended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the verylow SXS background of ~1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, suchresults are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similarinstruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imagingobservations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomiand will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray AstronomyRecovery Mission (XARM) and Athena.

Atomic data and spectral modeling constraints from high-resolution X-ray  observations of the Perseus cluster with Hitomi

  The Hitomi SXS spectrum of the Perseus cluster, with $\sim$5 eV resolution inthe 2-9 keV band, offers an unprecedented benchmark of the atomic modeling anddatabase for hot collisional plasmas. It reveals both successes and challengesof the current atomic codes. The latest versions of AtomDB/APEC (3.0.8), SPEX(3.03.00), and CHIANTI (8.0) all provide reasonable fits to the broad-bandspectrum, and are in close agreement on best-fit temperature, emission measure,and abundances of a few elements such as Ni. For the Fe abundance, the APEC andSPEX measurements differ by 16%, which is 17 times higher than the statisticaluncertainty. This is mostly attributed to the differences in adoptedcollisional excitation and dielectronic recombination rates of the strongestemission lines. We further investigate and compare the sensitivity of thederived physical parameters to the astrophysical source modeling andinstrumental effects. The Hitomi results show that an accurate atomic code isas important as the astrophysical modeling and instrumental calibrationaspects. Substantial updates of atomic databases and targeted laboratorymeasurements are needed to get the current codes ready for the data from thenext Hitomi-level mission.

Temperature Structure in the Perseus Cluster Core Observed with Hitomi

  The present paper investigates the temperature structure of the X-rayemitting plasma in the core of the Perseus cluster using the 1.8--20.0 keV dataobtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard the Hitomi Observatory.A series of four observations were carried out, with a total effective exposuretime of 338 ks and covering a central region $\sim7'$ in diameter. The SXS wasoperated with an energy resolution of $\sim$5 eV (full width at half maximum)at 5.9 keV. Not only fine structures of K-shell lines in He-like ions but alsotransitions from higher principal quantum numbers are clearly resolved from Sithrough Fe. This enables us to perform temperature diagnostics using the lineratios of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, and to provide the first direct measurement ofthe excitation temperature and ionization temperature in the Perseus cluster.The observed spectrum is roughly reproduced by a single temperature thermalplasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium, but detailed line ratiodiagnostics reveal slight deviations from this approximation. In particular,the data exhibit an apparent trend of increasing ionization temperature withincreasing atomic mass, as well as small differences between the ionization andexcitation temperatures for Fe, the only element for which both temperaturescan be measured. The best-fit two-temperature models suggest a combination of 3and 5 keV gas, which is consistent with the idea that the observed smalldeviations from a single temperature approximation are due to the effects ofprojection of the known radial temperature gradient in the cluster core alongthe line of sight. Comparison with the Chandra/ACIS and the XMM-Newton/RGSresults on the other hand suggests that additional lower-temperature componentsare present in the ICM but not detectable by Hitomi SXS given its 1.8--20 keVenergy band.

Hitomi X-ray Observation of the Pulsar Wind Nebula G21.5$-$0.9

  We present results from the Hitomi X-ray observation of a youngcomposite-type supernova remnant (SNR) G21.5$-$0.9, whose emission is dominatedby the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) contribution. The X-ray spectra in the 0.8-80keV range obtained with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS), Soft X-ray Imager(SXI) and Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) show a significant break in the continuum aspreviously found with the NuSTAR observation. After taking into account allknown emissions from the SNR other than the PWN itself, we find that the Hitomispectra can be fitted with a broken power law with photon indices of$\Gamma_1=1.74\pm0.02$ and $\Gamma_2=2.14\pm0.01$ below and above the break at$7.1\pm0.3$ keV, which is significantly lower than the NuSTAR result ($\sim9.0$keV). The spectral break cannot be reproduced by time-dependent particleinjection one-zone spectral energy distribution models, which stronglyindicates that a more complex emission model is needed, as suggested by recenttheoretical models. We also search for narrow emission or absorption lines withthe SXS, and perform a timing analysis of PSR J1833$-$1034 with the HXI andSGD. No significant pulsation is found from the pulsar. However, unexpectedly,narrow absorption line features are detected in the SXS data at 4.2345 keV and9.296 keV with a significance of 3.65 $\sigma$. While the origin of thesefeatures is not understood, their mere detection opens up a new field ofresearch and was only possible with the high resolution, sensitivity andability to measure extended sources provided by an X-ray microcalorimeter.

Detection of polarized gamma-ray emission from the Crab nebula with  Hitomi Soft Gamma-ray Detector

  We present the results from the Hitomi Soft Gamma-ray Detector (SGD)observation of the Crab nebula. The main part of SGD is a Compton camera, whichin addition to being a spectrometer, is capable of measuring polarization ofgamma-ray photons. The Crab nebula is one of the brightest X-ray / gamma-raysources on the sky, and, the only source from which polarized X-ray photonshave been detected. SGD observed the Crab nebula during the initial testobservation phase of Hitomi. We performed the data analysis of the SGDobservation, the SGD background estimation and the SGD Monte Carlo simulations,and, successfully detected polarized gamma-ray emission from the Crab nebulawith only about 5 ks exposure time. The obtained polarization fraction of thephase-integrated Crab emission (sum of pulsar and nebula emissions) is (22.1$\pm$ 10.6)% and, the polarization angle is 110.7$^o$ + 13.2 / $-$13.0$^o$ inthe energy range of 60--160 keV (The errors correspond to the 1 sigmadeviation). The confidence level of the polarization detection was 99.3%. Thepolarization angle measured by SGD is about one sigma deviation with theprojected spin axis of the pulsar, 124.0$^o$ $\pm$0.1$^o$.

Measurement of the cosmic ray spectrum above $4{\times}10^{18}$ eV using  inclined events detected with the Pierre Auger Observatory

  A measurement of the cosmic-ray spectrum for energies exceeding$4{\times}10^{18}$ eV is presented, which is based on the analysis of showerswith zenith angles greater than $60^{\circ}$ detected with the Pierre AugerObservatory between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013. The measured spectrumconfirms a flux suppression at the highest energies. Above $5.3{\times}10^{18}$eV, the "ankle", the flux can be described by a power law $E^{-\gamma}$ withindex $\gamma=2.70 \pm 0.02 \,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.1\,\text{(sys)}$ followed bya smooth suppression region. For the energy ($E_\text{s}$) at which thespectral flux has fallen to one-half of its extrapolated value in the absenceof suppression, we find$E_\text{s}=(5.12\pm0.25\,\text{(stat)}^{+1.0}_{-1.2}\,\text{(sys)}){\times}10^{19}$eV.

An improved limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos  from the Pierre Auger Observatory

  Neutrinos in the cosmic ray flux with energies near 1 EeV and above aredetectable with the Surface Detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Wereport here on searches through Auger data from 1 January 2004 until 20 June2013. No neutrino candidates were found, yielding a limit to the diffuse fluxof ultra-high energy neutrinos that challenges the Waxman-Bahcall boundpredictions. Neutrino identification is attempted using the broadtime-structure of the signals expected in the SD stations, and is efficientlydone for neutrinos of all flavors interacting in the atmosphere at large zenithangles, as well as for "Earth-skimming" neutrino interactions in the case oftau neutrinos. In this paper the searches for downward-going neutrinos in thezenith angle bins $60^\circ-75^\circ$ and $75^\circ-90^\circ$ as well as forupward-going neutrinos, are combined to give a single limit. The $90\%$ C.L.single-flavor limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos with an$E^{-2}$ spectrum in the energy range $1.0 \times 10^{17}$ eV - $2.5 \times10^{19}$ eV is $E_\nu^2 dN_\nu/dE_\nu < 6.4 \times 10^{-9}~ {\rm GeV~ cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~ sr^{-1}}$.

The Simons Observatory: Science goals and forecasts

  The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new cosmic microwave background experimentbeing built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design,and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature and polarizationanisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands: 27, 39,93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have threesmall-aperture 0.5-m telescopes (SATs) and one large-aperture 6-m telescope(LAT), with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals areto characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number ofrelativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from acosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, andconstrain the duration of reionization. The SATs will target the largestangular scales observable from Chile, mapping ~10% of the sky to a white noiselevel of 2 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure theprimordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, at a target level of $\sigma(r)=0.003$.The LAT will map ~40% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expectedwhite noise level of 6 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands,overlapping with the majority of the LSST sky region and partially with DESI.With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from thePlanck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmologicalparameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of themicrowave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematicSunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-anglepolarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will alsoprovide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000extragalactic sources.

The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment: Exploring Fundamental Symmetries  of the Universe

  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early Universe, thedynamics of the supernova bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary forlife and whether protons eventually decay --- these mysteries at the forefrontof particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the earlyevolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. TheLong-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developedplan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNEis conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensityneutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at FermiNational Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstreamof the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployedas a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground ResearchFacility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine inLead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source atFermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrinocharge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yetcost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and canaccommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptionalcombination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, andpotential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facilityfor the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from aroundthe globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year programof exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview ofLBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physicsworldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it willpossess.

Hitomi X-ray studies of Giant Radio Pulses from the Crab pulsar

  To search for giant X-ray pulses correlated with the giant radio pulses(GRPs) from the Crab pulsar, we performed a simultaneous observation of theCrab pulsar with the X-ray satellite Hitomi in the 2 -- 300 keV band and theKashima NICT radio observatory in the 1.4 -- 1.7 GHz band with a net exposureof about 2 ks on 25 March 2016, just before the loss of the Hitomi mission.Thetiming performance of the Hitomi instruments was confirmed to meet the timingrequirement and about 1,000 and 100 GRPs were simultaneously observed at themain and inter-pulse phases, respectively, and we found no apparent correlationbetween the giant radio pulses and the X-ray emission in either the main orinter-pulse phases.All variations are within the 2 sigma fluctuations of theX-ray fluxes at the pulse peaks, and the 3 sigma upper limits of variations ofmain- or inter- pulse GRPs are 22\% or 80\% of the peak flux in a 0.20 phasewidth, respectively, in the 2 -- 300 keV band.The values become 25\% or 110\%for main or inter-pulse GRPs, respectively, when the phase width is restrictedinto the 0.03 phase.Among the upper limits from the Hitomi satellite, those inthe 4.5-10 keV and the 70-300 keV are obtained for the first time, and those inother bands are consistent with previous reports.Numerically, the upper limitsof main- and inter-pulse GRPs in the 0.20 phase width are about (2.4 and 9.3)$\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, respectively. No significant variability inpulse profiles implies that the GRPs originated from a local place within themagnetosphere and the number of photon-emitting particles temporallyincreases.However, the results do not statistically rule out variationscorrelated with the GRPs, because the possible X-ray enhancement may appear dueto a $>0.02$\% brightening of the pulse-peak flux under such conditions.
