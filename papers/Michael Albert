Inflations of Geometric Grid Classes: Three Case Studies

  We enumerate three specific permutation classes defined by two forbiddenpatterns of length four. The techniques involve inflations of geometric gridclasses.

Unsplittable classes of separable permutations

  A permutation class is splittable if it is contained in the merge of two ofits proper subclasses. We characterise the unsplittable subclasses of the classof separable permutations both structurally and in terms of their bases.

Wilf-collapse in permutation classes having two basis elements of size  three

  We consider permutation classes having two basis elements of size three andone further basis element. We completely classify the possible enumerationsequences of such classes and demonstrate that there are far fewer of them thanmight be expected in principle.

Universal layered permutations

  We establish an exact formula for the length of the shortest permutationcontaining all layered permutations of length $n$, proving a conjecture ofGray.

Uniquely-Wilf classes

  Two permutations in a class are Wilf-equivalent if, for every size, $n$, thenumber of permutations in the class of size $n$ containing each of them is thesame. Those infinite classes that have only one equivalence class in each sizefor this relation are characterised provided either that they avoid at leastone permutation of size 3, or at least three permutations of size 4.

The enumeration of permutations avoiding 2143 and 4231

  We enumerate the pattern class Av(2143,4231) and completely describe itspermutations. The main tools are simple permutations and monotone grid classes.

Permutations Containing Many Patterns

  It is shown that the maximum number of patterns that can occur in apermutation of length $n$ is asymptotically $2^n$. This significantly improvesa previous result of Coleman.

The fine structure of 321 avoiding permutations

  Bivariate generating functions for various subsets of the class ofpermutations containing no descending sequence of length three or more aredetermined. The notion of absolute indecomposability of a permutation isintroduced, and used in enumerating permutations which have a block structureavoiding 321 and whose blocks also have such structure (recursively).Generalizations of these results are discussed.

On the length of the longest subsequence avoiding an arbitrary pattern  in a random permutation

  We consider the distribution of the length of the longest subsequenceavoiding a given pattern in a random permutation of length n. The well-studiedcase of a longest increasing subsequence corresponds to avoiding the pattern21. We show that there is some constant c such that the mean value of thislength is asymptotic to twice the square root of c times n and that thedistribution of the length is tightly concentrated around its mean. We observesome apparent connections between c and the Stanley-Wilf limit of the class ofpermutations avoiding the given pattern.

Young classes of permutations

  We characterise those classes of permutations having the property that forevery tableau shape either every permutation of that shape or no permutation ofthat shape belongs to the class. The characterisation is in terms of thedominance order for partitions (and their conjugates) and shows that for anysuch class there is a constant k such that no permutation in the class cancontain both an increasing and a decreasing sequence of length k.

Crystallographic structure of ultrathin Fe films on Cu(100)

  We report bcc-like crystal structures in 2-4 ML Fe films grown on fcc Cu(100)using scanning tunneling microscopy. The local bcc structure provides astraightforward explanation for their frequently reported outstanding magneticproperties, i.e., ferromagnetic ordering in all layers with a Curie temperatureabove 300 K. The non-pseudomorphic structure, which becomes pseudomorphic above4 ML film thickness is unexpected in terms of conventional rules of thin filmgrowth and stresses the importance of finite thickness effects in ferromagneticultrathin films.

Sorting with a forklift

  A fork stack is a generalised stack which allows pushes and pops of severalitems at a time. We consider the problem of determining which input streams canbe sorted using a single forkstack, or dually, which permutations of a fixedinput stream can be produced using a single forkstack. An algorithm is given tosolve the sorting problem and the minimal unsortable sequences are found. Theresults are extended to fork stacks where there are bounds on how many itemscan be pushed and popped at one time. In this context we also establish how toenumerate the collection of sortable sequences.

The enumeration of simple permutations

  A simple permutation is one which maps no proper non-singleton interval ontoan interval. We consider the enumeration of simple permutations from severalaspects. Our results include a straightforward relationship between theordinary generating function for simple permutations and that for allpermutations, that the coefficients of this series are not P-recursive, anasymptotic expansion for these coefficients, and a number of congruenceresults.

Permutation Classes of Polynomial Growth

  A pattern class is a set of permutations closed under the formation ofsubpermutations. Such classes can be characterised as those permutations notinvolving a particular set of forbidden permutations. A simple collection ofnecessary and sufficient conditions on sets of forbidden permutations whichensure that the associated pattern class is of polynomial growth is determined.A catalogue of all such sets of forbidden permutations having three or fewerelements is provided together with bounds on the degrees of the associatedenumerating polynomials.

All-cavity electromagnetically induced transparency and optical  switching: semiclassical theory

  The transmission of a probe field experiencing electromagnetically inducedtransparency and optical switching in an atomic medium enclosed in an opticalcavity is investigated. Using a semiclassical input-output theory for theinteraction between an ensemble of four-level atoms and three optical cavityfields coupled to the same spatial cavity mode, we derive the steady-statetransmission spectra of the probe field and discuss the dynamics of theintracavity field buildup. The analytical and numerical results are in goodagreement with recent experiments with ion Coulomb crystals [M. Albert et al.,Nature Photon. 5, 633 (2011)].

Quantum deformation of planar amplitudes

  In maximally supersymmetric four-dimensional gauge theories planar on-shelldiagrams are closely related to the positive Grassmannian and the celldecomposition of it into the union of so called positroid cells \cite{A}. Weestablish that volume forms on positroids used to express scattering amplitudescan be $q$-deformed to Hochschild homology classes of corresponding quantumalgebras. The planar amplitudes are represented in \cite {A} as sums ofcontributions of some set of positroid cells; we quantize these contributions.In classical limit our considerations allow us to obtain explicit formulas forcontributions of positroid cells to scattering amplitudes.

Subclasses of the separable permutations

  We prove that all subclasses of the separable permutations not containingAv(231) or a symmetry of this class have rational generating functions. Ourprincipal tools are partial well-order, atomicity, and the theory of stronglyrational permutation classes introduced here for the first time.

On the inverse image of pattern classes under bubble sort

  Let B be the operation of re-ordering a sequence by one pass of bubble sort.We completely answer the question of when the inverse image of a principalpattern class under B is a pattern class.

Homology of Lie algebra of supersymmetries

  We study the homology and cohomology groups of super Lie algebra ofsupersymmetries and of super Poincare algebra. We discuss in detail thecalculation in dimensions D=10 and D=6. Our methods can be applied to extendedsupersymmetry algebra and to other dimensions.

Pattern classes and priority queues

  When a set of permutations comprising a pattern class C is submitted as inputto a priority queue the resulting output is again a pattern class C'. The basisof C' is determined for pattern classes C whose basis elements have length 3,and is finite in these cases. An example is given of a class C with basis 2431for which C is not finitely based.

Isomorphisms between pattern classes

  Isomorphisms p between pattern classes A and B are considered. It is shownthat, if p is not a symmetry of the entire set of permutations, then, to withinsymmetry, A is a subset of one a small set of pattern classes whose structure,including their enumeration, is determined.

Integral invariants in flat superspace

  We are solving for the case of flat superspace some homological problems thatwere formulated by Berkovits and Howe. (Our considerations can be applied alsoto the case of supertorus.) These problems arise in the attempt to constructintegrals invariant with respect to supersymmetry. They appear also in othersituations, in particular, in the pure spinor formalism in supergravity.

Equipopularity Classes in the Separable Permutations

  When two patterns occur equally often in a set of permutations, we say thatthese patterns are equipopular. Using both structural and analytic tools, weclassify the equipopular patterns in the set of separable permutations. Inparticular, we show that the number of equipopularity classes for length $n$patterns in the separable permutations is equal to the number of partitions of$n-1$.

An elementary proof of Bevan's theorem on the growth of grid classes of  permutations

  Bevan established that the growth rate of a monotone grid class ofpermutations is equal to the square of the spectral radius of a relatedbipartite graph. We give an elementary and self-contained proof of ageneralization of this result using only Stirling's Formula, the method ofLagrange multipliers, and the singular value decomposition of matrices.

Characterising inflations of monotone grid classes of permutations

  We characterise those permutation classes whose simple permutations aremonotone griddable. This characterisation is obtained by identifying a set ofnine substructures, at least one of which must occur in any simple permutationcontaining a long sum of 21s.

The effect of the choice of neural network depth and breadth on the size  of its hypothesis space

  We show that the number of unique function mappings in a neural networkhypothesis space is inversely proportional to $\prod_lU_l!$, where $U_{l}$ isthe number of neurons in the hidden layer $l$.

A general theory of Wilf-equivalence for Catalan structures

  The existence of apparently coincidental equalities (also calledWilf-equivalences) between the enumeration sequences, or generating functions,of various hereditary classes of combinatorial structures has attractedsignificant interest. We investigate such coincidences among non-crossingmatchings and a variety of other Catalan structures including Dyck paths,231-avoiding permutations and plane forests. In particular we considerprincipal classes defined by not containing an occurrence of a single givenstructure. An easily computed equivalence relation among structures isdescribed such that if two structures are equivalent then the associatedprincipal classes have the same enumeration sequence. We give an asymptoticestimate of the number of equivalence classes of this relation among structuresof a given size and show that it is exponentially smaller than thecorresponding Catalan number. In other words these "coincidental" equalitiesare in fact very common among principal classes. Our results also allow us toprove, in a unified and bijective manner, several known Wilf-equivalences fromthe literature.

Complexity of Scheduling Charging in the Smart Grid

  In the smart grid, the intent is to use flexibility in demand, both tobalance demand and supply as well as to resolve potential congestion. A firstprominent example of such flexible demand is the charging of electric vehicles,which do not necessarily need to be charged as soon as they are plugged in. Theproblem of optimally scheduling the charging demand of electric vehicles withinthe constraints of the electricity infrastructure is called the chargescheduling problem. The models of the charging speed, horizon, and chargingdemand determine the computational complexity of the charge scheduling problem.For about 20 variants, we show, using a dynamic programming approach, that theproblem is either in P or weakly NP-hard. We also show that about 10 variantsof the problem are strongly NP-hard, presenting a potentially significantobstacle to their use in practical situations of scale.

Who Killed Albert Einstein? From Open Data to Murder Mystery Games

  This paper presents a framework for generating adventure games from opendata. Focusing on the murder mystery type of adventure games, the generator isable to transform open data from Wikipedia articles, OpenStreetMap and imagesfrom Wikimedia Commons into WikiMysteries. Every WikiMystery game revolvesaround the murder of a person with a Wikipedia article and populates the gamewith suspects who must be arrested by the player if guilty of the murder orabsolved if innocent. Starting from only one person as the victim, an extensivegenerative pipeline finds suspects, their alibis, and paths connecting themfrom open data, transforms open data into cities, buildings, non-playercharacters, locks and keys and dialog options. The paper describes in detaileach generative step, provides a specific playthrough of one WikiMystery whereAlbert Einstein is murdered, and evaluates the outcomes of games generated forthe 100 most influential people of the 20th century.

Noncommutative Geometry and Matrix Theory: Compactification on Tori

  We study toroidal compactification of Matrix theory, using ideas and resultsof non-commutative geometry. We generalize this to compactification on thenoncommutative torus, explain the classification of these backgrounds, andargue that they correspond in supergravity to tori with constant backgroundthree-form tensor field. The paper includes an introduction for mathematiciansto the IKKT formulation of Matrix theory and its relation to the BFSS Matrixtheory.

The monodromy groups of Schwarzian equations on closed Riemann surfaces

  Let \theta:\pi_1(R) \to \PSL(2,\C) be a homomorphism of the fundamental groupof an oriented, closed surface R of genus exceeding one. We will establish thefollowing theorem.  Theorem. Necessary and sufficient for \theta to be the monodromyrepresentation associated with a complex projective stucture on R, eitherunbranched or with a single branch point of order 2, is that \theta(\pi_1(R))be nonelementary. A branch point is required if and only if the representation\theta does not lift to \SL(2,\C).

The Green's function for the radial Schramm-Loewner evolution

  We prove the existence of the Green's function for radial SLE(k) for k<8.Unlike the chordal case where an explicit formula for the Green's function isknown for all values of k<8, we give an explicit formula only for k=4. Forother values of k, we give a formula in terms of an expectation with respect toSLE conditioned to go through a point.

Ice XII in its second regime of metastability

  We present neutron powder diffraction results which give unambiguous evidencefor the formation of the recently identified new crystalline ice phase[Lobbanet al.,Nature, 391, 268, (1998)], labeled ice XII, at completely differentconditions. Ice XII is produced here by compressing hexagonal ice I_h at T =77, 100, 140 and 160 K up to 1.8 GPa. It can be maintained at ambient pressurein the temperature range 1.5 < T < 135 K. High resolution diffraction iscarried out at T = 1.5 K and ambient pressure on ice XII and accuratestructural properties are obtained from Rietveld refinement. At T = 140 and 160K additionally ice III/IX is formed. The increasing amount of ice III/IX withincreasing temperature gives an upper limit of T ~ 150 K for the successfulformation of ice XII with the presented procedure.

Satellite-Mounted Light Sources as Photometric Calibration Standards

  A significant and growing portion of systematic error on a number offundamental parameters in astrophysics and cosmology is due to uncertaintiesfrom absolute photometric and flux standards. A path toward achieving majorreduction in such uncertainties may be provided by satellite-mounted lightsources, resulting in improvement in the ability to precisely characterizeatmospheric extinction, and thus helping to usher in the coming generation ofprecision results in astronomy. Toward this end, we have performed a campaignof observations of the 532 nm pulsed laser aboard the CALIPSO satellite, usinga portable network of cameras and photodiodes, to precisely measure atmosphericextinction.

Determination of the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate using frequency  noise calibration

  The strength of optomechanical interactions in a cavity optomechanical systemcan be quantified by a vacuum coupling rate $\vcr$ analogous to cavity quantumelectrodynamics. This single figure of merit removes the ambiguity in thefrequently quoted coupling parameter defining the frequency shift for a givenmechanical displacement, and the effective mass of the mechanical mode. Here wedemonstrate and verify a straightforward experimental technique to derive thevacuum optomechanical coupling rate. It only requires applying a knownfrequency modulation of the employed electromagnetic probe field and knowledgeof the mechanical oscillator's occupation. The method is experimentallyverified for a micromechanical mode in a toroidal whispering-gallery-resonatorand a nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a toroidal cavity via its nearfield.

Elastic Splines I: Existence

  Given interpolation points $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$ in the plane, it is knownthat there does not exist an interpolating curve with minimal bending energy,unless the given points lie sequentially along a line. We say than aninterpolating curve is {\it admissable} if each piece, connecting twoconsecutive points $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$, is an s-curve, where an {\it s-curve}is a planar curve which first turns at most $180^\circ$ in one direction andthen turns at most $180^\circ$ in the opposite direction. Our main result isthat among all admissable interpolating curves there exists a curve withminimal bending energy. We also prove, in a very constructive manner, theexistence of an s-curve, with minimal bending energy, which connects two givenunit tangent vectors.

Einstein's cosmology review of 1933: a new perspective on the  Einstein-de Sitter model of the cosmos

  We present a first English translation and analysis of a little-known reviewof relativistic cosmology written by Albert Einstein in late 1932. The article,which was published in 1933 in a book of Einstein papers translated intoFrench, contains a substantial review of static and dynamic relativistic modelsof the cosmos, culminating in a discussion of the Einstein-de Sitter model. Thearticle offers a valuable contemporaneous insight into Einstein's cosmology inthe 1930s and confirms that his interest lay in the development of the simplestmodel of the cosmos that could account for observation, rather than anexploration of all possible cosmic models. The article also confirms thatEinstein did not believe that simplistic relativistic models could give anaccurate description of the early universe.

Elastic Splines II: unicity of optimal s-curves and $G^2$ regularity of  splines

  Given points $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_m$ in the complex plane, we are concerned withthe problem of finding an interpolating curve with minimal bending energy(i.e., an optimal interpolating curve). It was shown previously that existenceis assured if one requires that the pieces of the interpolating curve bes-curves. In the present article we also impose the restriction that theses-curves have chord angles not exceeding $\pi/2$ in magnitude. With this setup,we have identified a sufficient condition for the $G^2$ regularity of optimalinterpolating curves. This sufficient condition relates to the stencil angles$\{\psi_j\}$, where $\psi_j$ is defined as the angular change in direction fromsegment $[P_{j-1},P_j]$ to segment $[P_j,P_{j+1}]$. A distinguished angle$\Psi$ ($\approx 37^\circ$) is identified, and we show that if the stencilangles satisfy $|\psi_j|<\Psi$, then optimal interpolating curves are globally$G^2$.  As with the previous article, most of our effort is concerned with thegeometric Hermite interpolation problem of finding an optimal s-curve whichconnects $P_1$ to $P_2$ with prescribed chord angles $(\alpha,\beta)$. Whereasexistence was previously shown, and sometimes uniqueness, the present articlebegins by establishing uniqueness when $|\alpha |,|\beta |\leq\pi/2$ and$|\alpha -\beta|<\pi$.

Coherent brightness modulations in the dwarf nova AT Cancri

  Light curves of the Z Cam type dwarf nova AT Cnc observed during standstillin 2016 and 2018 are analyzed. On the time scale of hours, previous reports onperiodicities, in particular the presence of negative superhumps, could not beconfirmed. Instead, a modulation with a period equal to the spectroscopicorbital period was detected which we thus interpret as a manifestations of thebinary revolution. It enables us to derive a more accurate value of 0.201634$\pm$ 0.000005 days (or its alias of 0.021580 days) for the period. AT Cnc alsoexhibits a hitherto unreported modulation of 25.731 $\pm$ 0.005 min, stable inperiod but not in amplitude over the entire time base of two years of theobservations. We tentatively interpret this modulation in the context of anintermediate polar model for the system.

Optimal treatment planning governed by kinetic equations

  In this paper we study a problem in radiotherapy treatment planning, wherethe evolution of the radiation field is governed by a deterministic Boltzmanntransport equation. We show existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutionsto an optimal dose distribution problem constrained by the Boltzmann ContinuousSlowing-Down equation in an appropriate function space. The main new difficultyis the treatment of the stopping power term. Furthermore, we characterizeoptimal controls for problems governed by this transport equation.

Geometric grid classes of permutations

  A geometric grid class consists of those permutations that can be drawn on aspecified set of line segments of slope \pm1 arranged in a rectangular patterngoverned by a matrix. Using a mixture of geometric and language theoreticmethods, we prove that such classes are specified by finite sets of forbiddenpermutations, are partially well ordered, and have rational generatingfunctions. Furthermore, we show that these properties are inherited by thesubclasses (under permutation involvement) of such classes, and establish thebasic lattice theoretic properties of the collection of all such subclasses.

On factorizing $F$-matrices in $Y(sl_n)$ and $U_q(\hat{sl_n})$ spin  chains

  We consider quantum spin chains arising from $N$-fold tensor products of thefundamental evaluation representations of $Y(sl_n)$ and $U_q(\hat{sl_n})$.Using the partial $F$-matrix formalism from the seminal work of Maillet andSanchez de Santos, we derive a completely factorized expression for the$F$-matrix of such models and prove its equivalence to the expression obtainedby Albert, Boos, Flume and Ruhlig. A new relation between the $F$-matrices andthe Bethe eigenvectors of these spin chains is given.

Large infinite antichains of permutations

  Infinite antichains of permutations have long been used to constructinteresting permutation classes and counterexamples. We prove the existence anddetail the construction of infinite antichains with arbitrarily large growthrates. As a consequence, we show that every proper permutation class iscontained in a class with a rational generating function. While this resultimplies the conclusion of the Marcus-Tardos theorem, that theorem is used inour proof.

Generating and enumerating 321-avoiding and skew-merged simple  permutations

  The simple permutations in two permutation classes --- the 321-avoidingpermutations and the skew-merged permutations --- are enumerated using auniform method. In both cases, these enumerations were known implicitly, byworking backwards from the enumeration of the class, but the simplepermutations had not been enumerated explicitly. In particular, the enumerationof the simple skew-merged permutations leads to the first truly structuralenumeration of this class as a whole. The extension of this method to a widercollection of classes namely grid classes of infinite paths is discussed.

Enumerating indices of Schubert varieties defined by inclusions

  By extending the notion of grid classes to include infinite grids, weestablish a structural characterisation of the simple permutations in Av(4231,35142, 42513, 351624), a pattern class which has three different connectionswith algebraic geometry, including the specification of indices of Schubertvarieties defined by inclusions. This characterisation leads to the enumerationof the class.

Collatz meets Fibonacci

  The Collatz map is defined for a positive even integer as half that integer,and for a positive odd integer as that integer threefold, plus one. The Collatzconjecture states that when the map is iterated the number one is eventuallyreached. We study permutations that arise as sequences from this iteration. Weshow that permutations of this type of length up to 14 are enumerated by theFibonacci numbers. Beyond that excess permutations appear. We will explain theappearance of these excess permutations and give an upper bound on the exactenumeration.

$2\times 2$ monotone grid classes are finitely based

  In this note, we prove that all $2 \times 2$ monotone grid classes arefinitely based, i.e., defined by a finite collection of minimal forbiddenpermutations. This follows from a slightly more general result about certain $2\times 2$ (generalized) grid classes having two monotone cells in the same row.

Rationality for subclasses of 321-avoiding permutations

  We prove that every proper subclass of the 321-avoiding permutations that isdefined either by only finitely many additional restrictions or is wellquasi-ordered has a rational generating function. To do so we show that anysuch class is in bijective correspondence with a regular language. The proofmakes significant use of formal languages and of a host of encodings, includinga new mapping called the panel encoding that maps languages over the infinitealphabet of positive integers avoiding certain subwords to languages overfinite alphabets.

On the growth of merges and staircases of permutation classes

  There is a well-known upper bound on the growth rate of the merge of twopermutation classes. Curiously, there is no known merge for which this bound isnot achieved. Using staircases of permutation classes, we provide sufficientconditions for this upper bound to be achieved. In particular, our resultsapply to all merges of principal permutation classes. We end by demonstratinghow our techniques can be used to reprove a result of B\'ona.

Prolific Compositions

  Under what circumstances might every extension of a combinatorial structurecontain more copies of another one than the original did? This property, whichwe call prolificity, holds universally in some cases (e.g., finite linearorders) and only trivially in others (e.g., permutations). Integercompositions, or equivalently layered permutations, provide a middle ground. Inthat setting, there are prolific compositions for a given pattern if and onlyif that pattern begins and ends with 1. For each pattern, there is an easilyconstructed automaton that recognises prolific compositions for that pattern.Some instances where there is a unique minimal prolific composition for apattern are classified.
