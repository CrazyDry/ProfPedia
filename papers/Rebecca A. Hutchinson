The Fourteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First  Spectroscopic Data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey  and from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution  Experiment

  The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been inoperation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release fromthis phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data ReleaseFourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its firsttwo years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of alldata taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon OscillationSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of theApache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2),including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machinelearning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubesfrom the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previousrelease (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format ofthe publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to theimportant technical papers describing how these data have been taken (bothtargeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSSwebsite (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links todata downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV isplanning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will befollowed by SDSS-V.
