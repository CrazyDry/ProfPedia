Advanced Cyberinfrastructure for Science, Engineering, and Public Policy

  Progress in many domains increasingly benefits from our ability to view thesystems through a computational lens, i.e., using computational abstractions ofthe domains; and our ability to acquire, share, integrate, and analyzedisparate types of data. These advances would not be possible without theadvanced data and computational cyberinfrastructure and tools for data capture,integration, analysis, modeling, and simulation. However, despite, and perhapsbecause of, advances in "big data" technologies for data acquisition,management and analytics, the other largely manual, and labor-intensive aspectsof the decision making process, e.g., formulating questions, designing studies,organizing, curating, connecting, correlating and integrating crossdomain data,drawing inferences and interpreting results, have become the rate-limitingsteps to progress. Advancing the capability and capacity for evidence-basedimprovements in science, engineering, and public policy requires support for(1) computational abstractions of the relevant domains coupled withcomputational methods and tools for their analysis, synthesis, simulation,visualization, sharing, and integration; (2) cognitive tools that leverage andextend the reach of human intellect, and partner with humans on all aspects ofthe activity; (3) nimble and trustworthy data cyber-infrastructures thatconnect, manage a variety of instruments, multiple interrelated data types andassociated metadata, data representations, processes, protocols and workflows;and enforce applicable security and data access and use policies; and (4)organizational and social structures and processes for collaborative andcoordinated activity across disciplinary and institutional boundaries.

Accelerating Science: A Computing Research Agenda

  The emergence of "big data" offers unprecedented opportunities for not onlyaccelerating scientific advances but also enabling new modes of discovery.Scientific progress in many disciplines is increasingly enabled by our abilityto examine natural phenomena through the computational lens, i.e., usingalgorithmic or information processing abstractions of the underlying processes;and our ability to acquire, share, integrate and analyze disparate types ofdata. However, there is a huge gap between our ability to acquire, store, andprocess data and our ability to make effective use of the data to advancediscovery. Despite successful automation of routine aspects of data managementand analytics, most elements of the scientific process currently requireconsiderable human expertise and effort. Accelerating science to keep pace withthe rate of data acquisition and data processing calls for the development ofalgorithmic or information processing abstractions, coupled with formal methodsand tools for modeling and simulation of natural processes as well as majorinnovations in cognitive tools for scientists, i.e., computational tools thatleverage and extend the reach of human intellect, and partner with humans on abroad range of tasks in scientific discovery (e.g., identifying, prioritizingformulating questions, designing, prioritizing and executing experimentsdesigned to answer a chosen question, drawing inferences and evaluating theresults, and formulating new questions, in a closed-loop fashion). This callsfor concerted research agenda aimed at: Development, analysis, integration,sharing, and simulation of algorithmic or information processing abstractionsof natural processes, coupled with formal methods and tools for their analysesand simulation; Innovations in cognitive tools that augment and extend humanintellect and partner with humans in all aspects of science.
