An ideal multi-secret sharing scheme based on minimal privileged  coalitions

  How to construct an ideal multi-secret sharing scheme for general accessstructures is difficult. In this paper, we solve an open problem proposed bySpiez et al.recently [Finite Fields and Their Application, 2011(17) 329-342],namely to design an algorithm of privileged coalitions of any length if suchcoalitions exist. Furthermore, in terms of privileged coalitions, we show thatmost of the existing multi-secret sharing schemes based on Shamir thresholdsecret sharing are not perfect by analyzing Yang et al.'s scheme and Pang etal.'s scheme. Finally, based on the algorithm mentioned above, we devise anideal multi-secret sharing scheme for families of access structures, whichpossesses more vivid authorized sets than that of the threshold scheme.

On a Conjecture of Givental

  These brief notes record our puzzles and findings surrounding Givental'srecent conjecture which expresses higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants interms of the genus-0 data. We limit our considerations to the case of aprojective line, whose Gromov-Witten invariants are well-known and easy tocompute. We make some simple checks supporting his conjecture.

The Hurwitz Enumeration Problem of Branched Covers and Hodge Integrals

  We use algebraic methods to compute the simple Hurwitz numbers for arbitrarysource and target Riemann surfaces. For an elliptic curve target, we reproducethe results previously obtained by string theorists. Motivated by theGromov-Witten potentials, we find a general generating function for the simpleHurwitz numbers in terms of the representation theory of the symmetric groupS_n. We also find a generating function for Hodge integrals on the moduli spaceM_{g,2} of Riemann surfaces with two marked points, similar to that found byFaber and Pandharipande for the case of one marked point.

Open string instantons and relative stable morphisms

  We show how topological open string theory amplitudes can be computed byusing relative stable morphisms in the algebraic category. We achieve our goalby explicitly working through an example which has been previously consideredby Ooguri and Vafa from the point of view of physics. By using the method ofvirtual localization, we successfully reproduce their results for multiplecovers of a holomorphic disc, whose boundary lies in a Lagrangian submanifoldof a Calabi-Yau 3-fold, by Riemann surfaces with arbitrary genera and number ofboundary components. In particular we show that in the case we consider thereare no open string instantons with more than one boundary component ending onthe Lagrangian submanifold.

Closed-form asymptotic sampling distributions under the coalescent with  recombination for an arbitrary number of loci

  Obtaining a closed-form sampling distribution for the coalescent withrecombination is a challenging problem. In the case of two loci, a newframework based on asymptotic series has recently been developed to deriveclosed-form results when the recombination rate is moderate to large. In thispaper, an arbitrary number of loci is considered and combinatorial approachesare employed to find closed-form expressions for the first couple of terms inan asymptotic expansion of the multi-locus sampling distribution. Theseexpressions are universal in the sense that their functional form in terms ofthe marginal one-locus distributions applies to all finite- andinfinite-alleles models of mutation.

Approximate sampling formulae for general finite-alleles models of  mutation

  Many applications in genetic analyses utilize sampling distributions, whichdescribe the probability of observing a sample of DNA sequences randomly drawnfrom a population. In the one-locus case with special models of mutation suchas the infinite-alleles model or the finite-alleles parent-independent mutationmodel, closed-form sampling distributions under the coalescent have been knownfor many decades. However, no exact formula is currently known for more generalmodels of mutation that are of biological interest. In this paper, models withfinitely-many alleles are considered, and an urn construction related to thecoalescent is used to derive approximate closed-form sampling formulas for anarbitrary irreducible recurrent mutation model or for a reversible recurrentmutation model, depending on whether the number of distinct observed alleletypes is at most three or four, respectively. It is demonstrated empiricallythat the formulas derived here are highly accurate when the per-base mutationrate is low, which holds for many biological organisms.

Efficient computation of the joint sample frequency spectra for multiple  populations

  A wide range of studies in population genetics have employed the samplefrequency spectrum (SFS), a summary statistic which describes the distributionof mutant alleles at a polymorphic site in a sample of DNA sequences. Inparticular, recently there has been growing interest in analyzing the joint SFSdata from multiple populations to infer parameters of complex demographichistories, including variable population sizes, population split times,migration rates, admixture proportions, and so on. Although much methodologicalprogress has been made, existing SFS-based inference methods suffer fromnumerical instability and high computational complexity when multiplepopulations are involved and the sample size is large. In this paper, wepresent new analytic formulas and algorithms that enable efficient computationof the expected joint SFS for multiple populations related by a complexdemographic model with arbitrary population size histories (including piecewiseexponential growth). Our results are implemented in a new software packagecalled momi (MOran Models for Inference). Through an empirical study involvingtens of populations, we demonstrate our improvements to numerical stability andcomputational complexity.

Tensor Decompositions via Two-Mode Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD)

  Tensor decompositions have rich applications in statistics and machinelearning, and developing efficient, accurate algorithms for the problem hasreceived much attention recently. Here, we present a new method built onKruskal's uniqueness theorem to decompose symmetric, nearly orthogonallydecomposable tensors. Unlike the classical higher-order singular valuedecomposition which unfolds a tensor along a single mode, we considerunfoldings along two modes and use rank-1 constraints to characterize theunderlying components. This tensor decomposition method provably handles agreater level of noise compared to previous methods and achieves a highestimation accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is robustto various noise distributions and that it performs especially favorably as theorder increases.

Hydrodynamic Limit of the Inhomogeneous $\ell$-TASEP with Open  Boundaries: Derivation and Solution

  The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process, which describes thetransport of interacting particles in a lattice, has been actively studied overthe past several decades. For general cases where particles have an extendedsize and hop at site-dependent rates, however, theoretically analyzing thedynamics has remained elusive. Here, we present such an analysis by derivingand solving the hydrodynamic limit. We obtain closed-form formulas forsteady-state particle densities and currents, as well as phase transitionboundaries. Surprisingly the latter depend on only four parameters: theparticle size and the first, the last, and the minimum hopping rates. Ourresults agree well with Monte Carlo simulations and can be used in inference.

Inference of Population History using Coalescent HMMs: Review and  Outlook

  Studying how diverse human populations are related is of historical andanthropological interest, in addition to providing a realistic null model fortesting for signatures of natural selection or disease associations.Furthermore, understanding the demographic histories of other species isplaying an increasingly important role in conservation genetics. A number ofstatistical methods have been developed to infer population demographichistories using whole-genome sequence data, with recent advances focusing onallowing for more flexible modeling choices, scaling to larger data sets, andincreasing statistical power. Here we review coalescent hidden Markov models, apowerful class of population genetic inference methods that can effectivelyutilize linkage disequilibrium information. We highlight recent advances, giveadvice for practitioners, point out potential pitfalls, and present possiblefuture research directions.

Disorder-Driven Superconductor-Insulator Transition in d-Wave  Superconducting Ultrathin Films

  We study the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in $d$-wavesuperconducting ultrathin films. By means of the kernel polynomial method, theBogoliubov-de Gennes equations are solved for square lattices with up to$360\times 360$ unit cells self-consistently, making it possible to observefully the nanoscale spatial fluctuations of the superconducting orderparameters and discriminate accurately the localized quasiparticle states fromthe extended ones by the lattice-size scaling of the generalized inverseparticipation ratio. It is shown that Anderson localization can not entirelyinhibit the occurrence of the local superconductivity in strongly-disordered$d$-wave superconductors. Separated by an insulating 'sea' completely, a fewisolated superconducting 'islands' with significant enhancement of the localsuperconducting order parameters can survive across the SIT. Thedisorder-driven SIT, therefore, is a transition from a $d$-wave superconductorto a Bose insulator which consists of localized Cooper pairs. Unlike an$s$-wave superconductor which presents a robust single-particle gap across theSIT, the optical conductivity of a $d$-wave superconductor reveals a gaplessinsulating phase, where the SIT can be detected by observing the disappearanceof the Drude weight with the increasing disorder.

Fundamental limits on the accuracy of demographic inference based on the  sample frequency spectrum

  The sample frequency spectrum (SFS) of DNA sequences from a collection ofindividuals is a summary statistic which is commonly used for parametricinference in population genetics. Despite the popularity of SFS-based inferencemethods, currently little is known about the information-theoretic limit on theestimation accuracy as a function of sample size. Here, we show that using theSFS to estimate the size history of a population has a minimax error of atleast $O(1/\log s)$, where $s$ is the number of independent segregating sitesused in the analysis. This rate is exponentially worse than known convergencerates for many classical estimation problems in statistics. Another surprisingaspect of our theoretical bound is that it does not depend on the dimension ofthe SFS, which is related to the number of sampled individuals. This meansthat, for a fixed number $s$ of segregating sites considered, using moreindividuals does not help to reduce the minimax error bound. Our resultpertains to populations that have experienced a bottleneck, and we argue thatit can be expected to apply to many populations in nature.

Distortion of genealogical properties when the sample is very large

  Study sample sizes in human genetics are growing rapidly, and in due courseit will become routine to analyze samples with hundreds of thousands if notmillions of individuals. In addition to posing computational challenges, suchlarge sample sizes call for carefully re-examining the theoretical foundationunderlying commonly-used analytical tools. Here, we study the accuracy of thecoalescent, a central model for studying the ancestry of a sample ofindividuals. The coalescent arises as a limit of a large class of random matingmodels and it is an accurate approximation to the original model provided thatthe population size is sufficiently larger than the sample size. We develop amethod for performing exact computation in the discrete-time Wright-Fisher(DTWF) model and compare several key genealogical quantities of interest withthe coalescent predictions. For realistic demographic scenarios, we find thatthere are a significant number of multiple- and simultaneous-merger eventsunder the DTWF model, which are absent in the coalescent by construction.Furthermore, for large sample sizes, there are noticeable differences in theexpected number of rare variants between the coalescent and the DTWF model. Tobalance the tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency, we proposea hybrid algorithm that utilizes the DTWF model for the recent past and thecoalescent for the more distant past. Our results demonstrate that the hybridmethod with only a handful of generations of the DTWF model leads to afrequency spectrum that is quite close to the prediction of the full DTWFmodel.

The site frequency spectrum for general coalescents

  General genealogical processes such as $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents,which respectively model multiple and simultaneous mergers, have importantapplications in studying marine species, strong positive selection, recurrentselective sweeps, strong bottlenecks, large sample sizes, and so on. Recently,there has been significant progress in developing useful inference tools forsuch general models. In particular, inference methods based on the sitefrequency spectrum (SFS) have received noticeable attention. Here, we derive anew formula for the expected SFS for general $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents,which leads to an efficient algorithm. For time-homogeneous coalescents, theruntime of our algorithm for computing the expected SFS is $O(n^2)$, where $n$is the sample size. This is a factor of $n^2$ faster than the state-of-the-artmethod. Furthermore, in contrast to existing methods, our method generalizes totime-inhomogeneous $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents with measures thatfactorize as $\Lambda(dx)/\zeta(t)$ and $\Xi(dx)/\zeta(t)$, respectively, where$\zeta$ denotes a strictly positive function of time. The runtime of ouralgorithm in this setting is $O(n^3)$. We also obtain general theoreticalresults for the identifiability of the $\Lambda$ measure when $\zeta$ is aconstant function, as well as for the identifiability of the function $\zeta$under a fixed $\Xi$ measure.

Two-Locus Likelihoods under Variable Population Size and Fine-Scale  Recombination Rate Estimation

  Two-locus sampling probabilities have played a central role in devising anefficient composite likelihood method for estimating fine-scale recombinationrates. Due to mathematical and computational challenges, these samplingprobabilities are typically computed under the unrealistic assumption of aconstant population size, and simulation studies have shown that resultingrecombination rate estimates can be severely biased in certain cases ofhistorical population size changes. To alleviate this problem, we develop herenew methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population sizefunctions that are piecewise constant. Our main theoretical result, implementedin a new software package called LDpop, is a novel formula for the samplingprobability that can be evaluated by numerically exponentiating a large butsparse matrix. This formula can handle moderate sample sizes ($n \leq 50$) anddemographic size histories with a large number of epochs ($\mathcal{D} \geq64$). In addition, LDpop implements an approximate formula for the samplingprobability that is reasonably accurate and scales to hundreds in sample size($n \geq 256$). Finally, LDpop includes an importance sampler for the posteriordistribution of two-locus genealogies, based on a new result for the optimalproposal distribution in the variable-size setting. Using our methods, we studyhow a sharp population bottleneck followed by rapid growth affects thecorrelation between partially linked sites. Then, through an extensivesimulation study, we show that accounting for population size changes undersuch a demographic model leads to substantial improvements in fine-scalerecombination rate estimation.

Decoding coalescent hidden Markov models in linear time

  In many areas of computational biology, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have beenused to model local genomic features. In particular, coalescent HMMs have beenused to infer ancient population sizes, migration rates, divergence times, andother parameters such as mutation and recombination rates. As more loci,sequences, and hidden states are added to the model, however, the runtime ofcoalescent HMMs can quickly become prohibitive. Here we present a new algorithmfor reducing the runtime of coalescent HMMs from quadratic in the number ofhidden time states to linear, without making any additional approximations. Ouralgorithm can be incorporated into various coalescent HMMs, including thepopular method PSMC for inferring variable effective population sizes. Here weimplement this algorithm to speed up our demographic inference method diCal,which is equivalent to PSMC when applied to a sample of two haplotypes. Wedemonstrate that the linear-time method can reconstruct a population sizechange history more accurately than the quadratic-time method, given similarcomputation resources. We also apply the method to data from the 1000 Genomesproject, inferring a high-resolution history of size changes in the Europeanpopulation.

Operator Norm Inequalities between Tensor Unfoldings on the Partition  Lattice

  Interest in higher-order tensors has recently surged in data-intensivefields, with a wide range of applications including image processing, blindsource separation, community detection, and feature extraction. A commonparadigm in tensor-related algorithms advocates unfolding (or flattening) thetensor into a matrix and applying classical methods developed for matrices.Despite the popularity of such techniques, how the functional properties of atensor changes upon unfolding is currently not well understood. In contrast tothe body of existing work which has focused almost exclusively onmatricizations, we here consider all possible unfoldings of an order-$k$tensor, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of partitions of$\{1,\ldots,k\}$. We derive general inequalities between the $l^p$-norms ofarbitrary unfoldings defined on the partition lattice. In particular, wedemonstrate how the spectral norm ($p=2$) of a tensor is bounded by that of itsunfoldings, and obtain an improved upper bound on the ratio of the Frobeniusnorm to the spectral norm of an arbitrary tensor. For specially-structuredtensors satisfying a generalized definition of orthogonal decomposability, weprove that the spectral norm remains invariant under specific subsets ofunfolding operations.

General triallelic frequency spectrum under demographic models with  variable population size

  It is becoming routine to obtain datasets on DNA sequence variation acrossseveral thousands of chromosomes, providing unprecedented opportunity to inferthe underlying biological and demographic forces. Such data make it vital tostudy summary statistics which offer enough compression to be tractable, whilepreserving a great deal of information. One well-studied summary is the sitefrequency spectrum---the empirical distribution, across segregating sites, ofthe sample frequency of the derived allele. However, most previous theoreticalwork has assumed that each site has experienced at most one mutation event inits genealogical history, which becomes less tenable for very large samplesizes. In this work we obtain, in closed-form, the predicted frequency spectrumof a site that has experienced at most two mutation events, under very generalassumptions about the distribution of branch lengths in the underlyingcoalescent tree. Among other applications, we obtain the frequency spectrum ofa triallelic site in a model of historically varying population size. Wedemonstrate the utility of our formulas in two settings: First, we show thattriallelic sites are more sensitive to the parameters of a population that hasexperienced historical growth, suggesting that they will have use if they canbe incorporated into demographic inference. Second, we investigate a recentlyproposed alternative mechanism of mutation in which the two derived alleles ofa triallelic site are created simultaneously within a single individual, and wedevelop a test to determine whether it is responsible for the excess oftriallelic sites in the human genome.

A sequentially Markov conditional sampling distribution for structured  populations with migration and recombination

  Conditional sampling distributions (CSDs), sometimes referred to as copyingmodels, underlie numerous practical tools in population genomic analyses.Though an important application that has received much attention is theinference of population structure, the explicit exchange of migrants atspecified rates has not hitherto been incorporated into the CSD in a principledframework. Recently, in the case of a single panmictic population, asequentially Markov CSD has been developed as an accurate, efficientapproximation to a principled CSD derived from the diffusion process dual tothe coalescent with recombination. In this paper, the sequentially Markov CSDframework is extended to incorporate subdivided population structure, thusproviding an efficiently computable CSD that admits a genealogicalinterpretation related to the structured coalescent with migration andrecombination. As a concrete application, it is demonstrated empirically thatthe CSD developed here can be employed to yield accurate estimation of a widerange of migration rates.

On the Critical Behavior of D1-brane Theories

  We study renormalization-group flow patterns in theories arising on D1-branesin various supersymmetry-breaking backgrounds. We argue that the theory of ND1-branes transverse to an orbifold space can be fine-tuned to flow to thecorresponding orbifold conformal field theory in the infrared, for particularvalues of the couplings and theta angles which we determine using the discretesymmetries of the model. By calculating various nonplanar contributions to thescalar potential in the worldvolume theory, we show that fine-tuning is in factrequired at finite N, as would be generically expected. We further comment onthe presence of singular conformal field theories (such as those whose targetspace includes a ``throat'' described by an exactly solvable CFT) in thenon-supersymmetric context. Throughout the analysis two applications areconsidered: to gauge theory/gravity duality and to linear sigma modeltechniques for studying worldsheet string theory.

Effects of Strong Correlations on the Zero Bias Anomaly in the Extended  Hubbard Model with Disorder

  We study the effect of strong correlations on the zero bias anomaly (ZBA) indisordered interacting systems. We focus on the two-dimensional extendedAnderson-Hubbard model, which has both on-site and nearest-neighborinteractions on a square lattice. We use a variation of dynamical mean fieldtheory in which the diagonal self-energy is solved self-consistently at eachsite on the lattice for each realization of the randomly-distributed disorderpotential. Since the ZBA occurs in systems with both strong disorder and stronginteractions, we use a simplified atomic-limit approximation for the diagonalinelastic self-energy that becomes exact in the large-disorder limit. Theoff-diagonal self-energy is treated within the Hartree-Fock approximation. Thevalidity of these approximations is discussed in detail. We find that strongcorrelations have a significant effect on the ZBA at half filling, and enhancethe Coulomb gap when the interaction is finite-ranged.

An explicit transition density expansion for a multi-allelic  Wright-Fisher diffusion with general diploid selection

  Characterizing time-evolution of allele frequencies in a population is afundamental problem in population genetics. In the Wright-Fisher diffusion,such dynamics is captured by the transition density function, which satisfieswell-known partial differential equations. For a multi-allelic model withgeneral diploid selection, various theoretical results exist on representationsof the transition density, but finding an explicit formula has remained adifficult problem. In this paper, a technique recently developed for adiallelic model is extended to find an explicit transition density for anarbitrary number of alleles, under a general diploid selection model withrecurrent parent-independent mutation. Specifically, the method finds theeigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the generator associated with themulti-allelic diffusion, thus yielding an accurate spectral representation ofthe transition density. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient,accurate computation of various other quantities of interest, including thenormalizing constant of the stationary distribution and the rate of convergenceto this distribution.

SMaSH: A Benchmarking Toolkit for Human Genome Variant Calling

  Motivation: Computational methods are essential to extract actionableinformation from raw sequencing data, and to thus fulfill the promise ofnext-generation sequencing technology. Unfortunately, computational toolsdeveloped to call variants from human sequencing data disagree on many of theirpredictions, and current methods to evaluate accuracy and computationalperformance are ad-hoc and incomplete. Agreement on benchmarking variantcalling methods would stimulate development of genomic processing tools andfacilitate communication among researchers.  Results: We propose SMaSH, a benchmarking methodology for evaluating humangenome variant calling algorithms. We generate synthetic datasets, organize andinterpret a wide range of existing benchmarking data for real genomes, andpropose a set of accuracy and computational performance metrics for evaluatingvariant calling methods on this benchmarking data. Moreover, we illustrate theutility of SMaSH to evaluate the performance of some leading single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP), indel, and structural variant calling algorithms.  Availability: We provide free and open access online to the SMaSH toolkit,along with detailed documentation, at smash.cs.berkeley.edu.

Probe of Spin Dynamics in Superconducting NbN Thin Films via Spin  Pumping

  The emerging field of superconductor (SC) spintronics has attracted intensiveattentions recently. Many fantastic spin dependent properties in SC have beendiscovered, including the observation of large magnetoresistance, long spinlifetimes and the giant spin Hall effect in SC, as well as spin supercurrent inJosephson junctions, etc. Regarding the spin dynamic in SC films, few studieshas been reported yet. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamicsin an s-wave superconducting NbN film via spin pumping from an adjacentinsulating ferromagnet GdN layer. A profound coherence peak of the Gilbertdamping is observed slightly below the superconducting critical temperature ofthe NbN layer, which is consistent with recent theoretical studies. Our resultsfurther indicate that spin pumping could be a powerful tool for investigatingthe spin dynamics in 2D crystalline superconductors.

An asymptotic sampling formula for the coalescent with Recombination

  Ewens sampling formula (ESF) is a one-parameter family of probabilitydistributions with a number of intriguing combinatorial connections. Thiselegant closed-form formula first arose in biology as the stationaryprobability distribution of a sample configuration at one locus under theinfinite-alleles model of mutation. Since its discovery in the early 1970s, theESF has been used in various biological applications, and has sparked severalinteresting mathematical generalizations. In the population genetics community,extending the underlying random-mating model to include recombination hasreceived much attention in the past, but no general closed-form samplingformula is currently known even for the simplest extension, that is, a modelwith two loci. In this paper, we show that it is possible to obtain usefulclosed-form results in the case the population-scaled recombination rate $\rho$is large but not necessarily infinite. Specifically, we consider an asymptoticexpansion of the two-locus sampling formula in inverse powers of $\rho$ andobtain closed-form expressions for the first few terms in the expansion. Ourasymptotic sampling formula applies to arbitrary sample sizes andconfigurations.

Padé approximants and exact two-locus sampling distributions

  For population genetics models with recombination, obtaining an exact,analytic sampling distribution has remained a challenging open problem forseveral decades. Recently, a new perspective based on asymptotic series hasbeen introduced to make progress on this problem. Specifically, closed-formexpressions have been derived for the first few terms in an asymptoticexpansion of the two-locus sampling distribution when the recombination rate$\rho$ is moderate to large. In this paper, a new computational technique isdeveloped for finding the asymptotic expansion to an arbitrary order.Computation in this new approach can be automated easily. Furthermore, it isproved here that only a finite number of terms in the asymptotic expansion isneeded to recover (via the method of Pad\'{e} approximants) the exact two-locussampling distribution as an analytic function of $\rho$; this function is exactfor all values of $\rho\in[0,\infty)$. It is also shown that the newcomputational framework presented here is flexible enough to incorporatenatural selection.

Tractable diffusion and coalescent processes for weakly correlated loci

  Widely used models in genetics include the Wright-Fisher diffusion and itsmoment dual, Kingman's coalescent. Each has a multilocus extension but underneither extension is the sampling distribution available in closed-form, andtheir computation is extremely difficult. In this paper we derive two newmultilocus population genetic models, one a diffusion and the other acoalescent process, which are much simpler than the standard models, but whichcapture their key properties for large recombination rates. The diffusion modelis based on a central limit theorem for density dependent population processes,and we show that the sampling distribution is a linear combination of momentsof Gaussian distributions and hence available in closed-form. The coalescentprocess is based on a probabilistic coupling of the ancestral recombinationgraph to a simpler genealogical process which exposes the leading dynamics ofthe former. We further demonstrate that when we consider the samplingdistribution as an asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of the recombinationparameter, the sampling distributions of the new models agree with the standardones up to the first two orders.

A novel spectral method for inferring general diploid selection from  time series genetic data

  The increased availability of time series genetic variation data fromexperimental evolution studies and ancient DNA samples has created newopportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and toestimate their associated fitness parameters. However, it is a challengingproblem to compute the likelihood of nonneutral models for the populationallele frequency dynamics, given the observed temporal DNA data. Here, wedevelop a novel spectral algorithm to analytically and efficiently integrateover all possible frequency trajectories between consecutive time points. Thisadvance circumvents the limitations of existing methods which requirefine-tuning the discretization of the population allele frequency space whennumerically approximating requisite integrals. Furthermore, our method isflexible enough to handle general diploid models of selection where theheterozygote and homozygote fitness parameters can take any values, whileprevious methods focused on only a few restricted models of selection. Wedemonstrate the utility of our method on simulated data and also apply it toanalyze ancient DNA data from genetic loci associated with coat coloration inhorses. In contrast to previous studies, our exploration of the full fitnessparameter space reveals that a heterozygote advantage form of balancingselection may have been acting on these loci.

A Likelihood-Free Inference Framework for Population Genetic Data using  Exchangeable Neural Networks

  An explosion of high-throughput DNA sequencing in the past decade has led toa surge of interest in population-scale inference with whole-genome data.Recent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methodsfor relatively simple model classes, and few scalable general-purpose inferencetechniques exist for more realistic, complex models. To achieve this, twoinferential challenges need to be addressed: (1) population data areexchangeable, calling for methods that efficiently exploit the symmetries ofthe data, and (2) computing likelihoods is intractable as it requiresintegrating over a set of correlated, extremely high-dimensional latentvariables. These challenges are traditionally tackled by likelihood-freemethods that use scientific simulators to generate datasets and reduce them tohand-designed, permutation-invariant summary statistics, often leading toinaccurate inference. In this work, we develop an exchangeable neural networkthat performs summary statistic-free, likelihood-free inference. Our frameworkcan be applied in a black-box fashion across a variety of simulation-basedtasks, both within and outside biology. We demonstrate the power of ourapproach on the recombination hotspot testing problem, outperforming thestate-of-the-art.

Unoccupied electronic structure and signatures of topological Fermi arcs  in the Weyl semimetal candidate Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$

  Weyl semimetals have sparked intense research interest, but experimental workhas been limited to the TaAs family of compounds. Recently, a number oftheoretical works have predicted that compounds in the Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$series are Weyl semimetals. Such proposals are particularly exciting becauseMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ has a quasi two-dimensional crystal structure well-suitedto many transport experiments, while WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ have already been thesubject of numerous proposals for device applications. However, with availableARPES techniques it is challenging to demonstrate a Weyl semimetal inMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$. According to the predictions, the Weyl points are abovethe Fermi level, the system approaches two critical points as a function ofdoping, there are many irrelevant bulk bands, the Fermi arcs are nearlydegenerate with bulk bands and the bulk band gap is small. Here, we studyMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ for $x = 0.07$ and 0.45 using pump-probe ARPES. Thesystem exhibits a dramatic response to the pump laser and we successfullyaccess states $> 0.2$eV above the Fermi level. For the first time, we observedirect, experimental signatures of Fermi arcs in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$, whichagree well with theoretical calculations of the surface states. However, wecaution that the interpretation of these features depends sensitively on freeparameters in the surface state calculation. We comment on the prospect ofconclusively demonstrating a Weyl semimetal in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$.

Measuring Chern numbers above the Fermi level in the Type II Weyl  semimetal Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$

  It has recently been proposed that electronic band structures in crystalsgive rise to a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion, which violatesLorentz invariance and, consequently, is forbidden in particle physics. It wasfurther predicted that Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ may realize such a Type II Weylfermion. One crucial challenge is that the Weyl points in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$are predicted to lie above the Fermi level. Here, by studying a simple modelfor a Type II Weyl cone, we clarify the importance of accessing the unoccupiedband structure to demonstrate that Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ is a Weyl semimetal.Then, we use pump-probe angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (pump-probeARPES) to directly observe the unoccupied band structure ofMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$. For the first time, we directly access states $> 0.2$ eVabove the Fermi level. By comparing our results with $\textit{ab initio}$calculations, we conclude that we directly observe the surface state containingthe topological Fermi arc. Our work opens the way to studying the unoccupiedband structure as well as the time-domain relaxation dynamics ofMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ and related transition metal dichalcogenides.

Atomic and Molecular Gas in Colliding Galaxy Systems: I. The Data

  We present HI and CO(1-0) interferometric observations of 10 comparable-massinteracting systems obtained at the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Owens ValleyRadio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter array. The primary intent of this study isto investigate the response of cold gas during the early stages of collision ofmassive disk galaxies. The sample sources are selected based on theirluminosity (M_B < -19), projected separation (5-40 kpc), and single dishCO(1-0) content (S_{CO} > 20 Jy km/s). These selection criteria result in asample that primarily consists of systems in the early stages of an interactionor a merger. Despite this sample selection, 50% of the systems show long HItidal tails indicative of a tidal disruption in a prograde orbit. In addition,all (4/4) of the infrared luminous pairs (LIRGs) in the sample show long HItails, suggesting that the presence of a long HI tail can be a possiblesignature of enhanced star formation activity in a collision of gas-richgalaxies. More than half of the groups show a displacement of HI peaks from thestellar disks. The CO(1-0) distribution is generally clumpy and widelydistributed, unlike in most IR-selected late stage mergers -- in fact, CO peaksare displaced from the stellar nucleus in 20% (4/18) of the galaxies withrobust CO detection. HI and CO(1-0) Position Velocity Diagrams (PVDs) androtation curves are also presented, and their comparison with the numericalsimulation analyzed in Paper I show evidence for radial inflow and wideoccurrences of nuclear molecular rings. These results are further quantified byexamining physical and structural parameters derived in comparison withisolated systems in the BIMA SONG sample in our forthcoming paper.

First-principles study on oxidation effects in uranium oxides and  high-pressure high-temperature behavior of point defects in uranium dioxide

  Formation Gibbs free energy of point defects and oxygen clusters in uraniumdioxide at high-pressure high-temperature conditions are calculated from firstprinciples, using the LSDA+U approach for the electronic structure and theDebye model for the lattice vibrations. The phonon contribution on Frenkelpairs is found to be notable, whereas it is negligible for the Schottky defect.Hydrostatic compression changes the formation energies drastically, makingdefect concentrations depend more sensitively on pressure. Calculations showthat, if no oxygen clusters are considered, uranium vacancy becomes predominantin overstoichiometric UO2 with the aid of the contribution from latticevibrations, while compression favors oxygen defects and suppresses uraniumvacancy greatly. At ambient pressure, however, the experimental observation ofpredominant oxygen defects in this regime can be reproduced only in a form ofcuboctahedral clusters, underlining the importance of defect clustering inUO2+x. Making use of the point defect model, an equation of state fornon-stoichiometric oxides is established, which is then applied to describe theshock Hugoniot of UO2+x. Furthermore, the oxidization and compression behaviorof uranium monoxide, triuranium octoxide, uranium trioxide, and a series ofdefective UO2 at zero Kelvin are investigated. The evolution of mechanicalproperties and electronic structures with an increase of the oxidation degreeare analyzed, revealing the transition of the groundstate of uranium oxidesfrom metallic to Mott insulator and then to charge-transfer insulator due tothe interplay of strongly correlated effects of 5f orbitals and the shift ofelectrons from uranium to oxygen atoms.

The influence of relatives on the efficiency and error rate of familial  searching

  We investigate the consequences of adopting the criteria used by the state ofCalifornia, as described by Myers et al. (2011), for conducting familialsearches. We carried out a simulation study of randomly generated profiles ofrelated and unrelated individuals with 13-locus CODIS genotypes and YFilerY-chromosome haplotypes, on which the Myers protocol for relativeidentification was carried out. For Y-chromosome sharing first degreerelatives, the Myers protocol has a high probability (80 - 99%) of identifyingtheir relationship. For unrelated individuals, there is a low probability thatan unrelated person in the database will be identified as a first-degreerelative. For more distant Y-haplotype sharing relatives (half-siblings, firstcousins, half-first cousins or second cousins) there is a substantialprobability that the more distant relative will be incorrectly identified as afirst-degree relative. For example, there is a 3 - 18% probability that a firstcousin will be identified as a full sibling, with the probability depending onthe population background. Although the California familial search policy islikely to identify a first degree relative if his profile is in the database,and it poses little risk of falsely identifying an unrelated individual in adatabase as a first-degree relative, there is a substantial risk of falselyidentifying a more distant Y-haplotype sharing relative in the database as afirst-degree relative, with the consequence that their immediate family maybecome the target for further investigation. This risk falls disproportionatelyon those ethnic groups that are currently overrepresented in state and federaldatabases.

Descartes' rule of signs and the identifiability of population  demographic models from genomic variation data

  The sample frequency spectrum (SFS) is a widely-used summary statistic ofgenomic variation in a sample of homologous DNA sequences. It provides a highlyefficient dimensional reduction of large-scale population genomic data and itsmathematical dependence on the underlying population demography is wellunderstood, thus enabling the development of efficient inference algorithms.However, it has been recently shown that very different population demographiescan actually generate the same SFS for arbitrarily large sample sizes. Althoughin principle this nonidentifiability issue poses a thorny challenge tostatistical inference, the population size functions involved in thecounterexamples are arguably not so biologically realistic. Here, we revisitthis problem and examine the identifiability of demographic models under therestriction that the population sizes are piecewise-defined where each piecebelongs to some family of biologically-motivated functions. Under thisassumption, we prove that the expected SFS of a sample uniquely determines theunderlying demographic model, provided that the sample is sufficiently large.We obtain a general bound on the sample size sufficient for identifiability;the bound depends on the number of pieces in the demographic model and also onthe type of population size function in each piece. In the cases ofpiecewise-constant, piecewise-exponential and piecewise-generalized-exponentialmodels, which are often assumed in population genomic inferences, we provideexplicit formulas for the bounds as simple functions of the number of pieces.Lastly, we obtain analogous results for the "folded" SFS, which is often usedwhen there is ambiguity as to which allelic type is ancestral. Our results areproved using a generalization of Descartes' rule of signs for polynomials tothe Laplace transform of piecewise continuous functions.

Geometry of the sample frequency spectrum and the perils of demographic  inference

  The sample frequency spectrum (SFS), which describes the distribution ofmutant alleles in a sample of DNA sequences, is a widely used summary statisticin population genetics. The expected SFS has a strong dependence on thehistorical population demography and this property is exploited by popularstatistical methods to infer complex demographic histories from DNA sequencedata. Most, if not all, of these inference methods exhibit pathologicalbehavior, however. Specifically, they often display runaway behavior inoptimization, where the inferred population sizes and epoch durations candegenerate to 0 or diverge to infinity, and show undesirable sensitivity of theinferred demography to perturbations in the data. The goal of this paper is toprovide theoretical insights into why such problems arise. To this end, wecharacterize the geometry of the expected SFS for piecewise-constantdemographic histories and use our results to show that the aforementionedpathological behavior of popular inference methods is intrinsic to the geometryof the expected SFS. We provide explicit descriptions and visualizations for atoy model with sample size 4, and generalize our intuition to arbitrary samplesizes n using tools from convex and algebraic geometry. We also develop auniversal characterization result which shows that the expected SFS of a sampleof size n under an arbitrary population history can be recapitulated by apiecewise-constant demography with only k(n) epochs, where k(n) is between n/2and 2n-1. The set of expected SFS for piecewise-constant demographies withfewer than k(n) epochs is open and non-convex, which causes the above phenomenafor inference from data.

A search for dark matter in events with one jet and missing transverse  energy in pp-bar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV

  We present the results of a search for dark matter production in the monojetsignature. We analyze a sample of Tevatron pp-bar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.7/fb recorded by the CDF IIdetector. In events with large missing transverse energy and one energetic jet,we find good agreement between the standard model prediction and the observeddata. We set 90% confidence level upper limits on the dark matter productionrate. The limits are translated into bounds on nucleon-dark matter scatteringrates which are competitive with current direct detection bounds onspin-independent interaction below a dark matter candidate mass of 5 GeV/c^2,and on spin-dependent interactions up to masses of 200 GeV/c^2.

Measurements of Angular Distributions of Muons From Upsilon Meson Decays  in p p-bar Collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV

  The angular distributions of muons from Upsilon(1S,2S,3S) to mu+mu- decaysare measured using data from proton anti-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeVcorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.7 /fb and collected with the CDFII detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. This analysis is the first to report thefull angular distributions as functions of transverse momentum pT for theUpsilon mesons in both the Collins-Soper and s-channel helicity frames. This isalso the first measurement of spin alignment of Upsilon(3S) mesons. Within thekinematic range of Upsilon rapidity |y|<0.6 and pT up to 40 GeV/c, the angulardistributions are found to be nearly isotropic.

Search for high-mass resonances decaying into ZZ in p$\bar{p}$  collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$\,TeV

  We search for high-mass resonances decaying into Z boson pairs using datacorresponding to 6 fb^-1 collected by the CDF experiment in p\bar{p} collisionsat sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. The search is performed in three distinct final states: ZZ--> l^+l^-l^+l^-, ZZ --> l^+l^-\nu\nu, and ZZ --> l^+l^-jj. For aRandall-Sundrum graviton G*, the 95% CL upper limits on the production crosssection times branching ratio to ZZ, sigma(p\bar{p} --> G^* --> ZZ), varybetween 0.26 pb and 0.045 pb in the mass range 300 < M_{G*} < 1000 GeV/c^2.

Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson Produced in Association with a  $Z$ Boson in $p\bar{p}$ Collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV

  We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced inassociation with a $Z$ boson, using up to 7.9 fb$^{-1}$ of integratedluminosity from $p\bar{p}$ collisions collected with the CDF II detector. Weutilize several novel techniques, including multivariate lepton selection,multivariate trigger parametrization, and a multi-stage signal discriminantconsisting of specialized functions trained to distinguish individualbackgrounds. By increasing acceptance and enhancing signal discrimination,these techniques have significantly improved the sensitivity of the analysisabove what was expected from a larger dataset alone. We observe no significantevidence for a signal, and we set limits on the $ZH$ production cross section.For a Higgs boson with mass 115 GeV/$c^2$, we expect (observe) a limit of 3.9(4.8) times the standard model predicted value, at the 95% credibility level.

Measurement of the Top Quark Mass in the All-Hadronic Mode at CDF

  We present a measurement of the top quark mass (Mtop) in the all-hadronicdecay channel using 5.8 fb^{-1} of proton-antiproton data collected with theCDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Events with 6 to 8 jets areselected by a neural network algorithm and by the requirement that at least oneof the jets is tagged as a b quark jet. The measurement is performed by alikelihood fit technique, which determines simultaneously Mtop and the jetenergy scale (JES) calibration. The fit yields a value of 172.5 +- 1.4(stat)+-1.0(JES) +-1.1(syst) GeV/c^2.

Measurement of CP-violation asymmetries in D0 to Ks pi+ pi-

  We report a measurement of time-integrated CP-violation asymmetries in theresonant substructure of the three-body decay D0 to Ks pi+ pi- using CDF IIdata corresponding to 6.0 invfb of integrated luminosity from Tevatron ppbarcollisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The charm mesons used in this analysis comefrom D*+(2010) to D0 pi+ and D*-(2010) to D0bar pi-, where the productionflavor of the charm meson is determined by the charge of the accompanying pion.We apply a Dalitz-amplitude analysis for the description of the dynamic decaystructure and use two complementary approaches, namely a full Dalitz-plot fitemploying the isobar model for the contributing resonances and amodel-independent bin-by-bin comparison of the D0 and D0bar Dalitz plots. Wefind no CP-violation effects and measure an asymmetry of ACP = (-0.05 +- 0.57(stat) +- 0.54 (syst))% for the overall integrated CP-violation asymmetry,consistent with the standard model prediction.

Measurement of Bs0 --> Ds(*)+ Ds(*)- Branching Ratios

  The decays Bs0 --> Ds(*)+ Ds(*)- are reconstructed in a data samplecorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.8 fb-1 collected by the CDF IIdetector at the Tevatron p\bar{p} collider. All decay modes are observed with asignificance of more than 10 sigma, and we measure the Bs0 production ratetimes Bs0 --> Ds(*)+ Ds(*)- branching ratios relative to the normalization modeB0 --> Ds+ D- to be $0.183 \pm 0.021 \pm 0.017$ for Bs0 --> Ds+ Ds-, $0.424 \pm0.046 \pm 0.035$ for Bs0 --> Ds*+- Ds-+, $0.654 \pm 0.072 \pm 0.065$ for Bs0--> Ds*+ Ds*-, and $1.261 \pm 0.095 \pm 0.112$ for the inclusive decay Bs0 -->Ds(*)+ Ds(*)-, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic. Theseresults are the most precise single measurements to date and provide importantconstraints for indirect searches for non-standard model physics in Bs0 mixing.

Observation of Exclusive Gamma Gamma Production in p pbar Collisions at  sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV

  We have observed exclusive \gamma\gamma production in proton-antiprotoncollisions at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, using data from 1.11 \pm 0.07 fb^{-1}integrated luminosity taken by the Run II Collider Detector at Fermilab. Weselected events with two electromagnetic showers, each with transverse energyE_T > 2.5 GeV and pseudorapidity |\eta| < 1.0, with no other particles detectedin -7.4 < \eta < +7.4. The two showers have similar E_T and azimuthal angleseparation \Delta\phi \sim \pi; 34 events have two charged particle tracks,consistent with the QED process p \bar{p} to p + e^+e^- + \bar{p} by two-photonexchange, while 43 events have no charged tracks. The number of these eventsthat are exclusive \pi^0\pi^0 is consistent with zero and is < 15 at 95% C.L.The cross section for p\bar{p} to p+\gamma\gamma+\bar{p} with |\eta(\gamma)| <1.0 and E_T(\gamma) > 2.5$ GeV is2.48^{+0.40}_{-0.35}(stat)^{+0.40}_{-0.51}(syst) pb.

Search for anomalous production of multiple leptons in association with  W and Z bosons at CDF

  This paper presents a search for anomalous production of multiple low-energyleptons in association with a W or Z boson using events collected at the CDFexperiment corresponding to 5.1 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. This searchis sensitive to a wide range of topologies with low-momentum leptons, includingthose with the leptons near one another. The observed rates of production ofadditional electrons and muons are compared with the standard modelpredictions. No indications of phenomena beyond the standard model are found. A95% confidence level limit is presented on the production cross section for abenchmark model of supersymmetric hidden-valley Higgs production. Particleidentification efficiencies are also provided to enable the calculation oflimits on additional models.

Measurement of the $WZ$ Cross Section and Triple Gauge Couplings in $p  \bar p$ Collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV

  This Letter describes the current most precise measurement of the $WZ$production cross section as well as limits on anomalous $WWZ$ couplings at acenter-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV in proton-antiproton collisions for theCollider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). $WZ$ candidates are reconstructed fromdecays containing three charged leptons and missing energy from a neutrino,where the charged leptons are either electrons or muons. Using data collectedby the CDF II detector (7.1 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity), 63 candidateevents are observed with the expected background contributing $8 \pm 1$ events.The measured total cross section $\sigma (p \bar p \to WZ) =3.93_{-0.53}^{+0.60}(\text{stat})_{-0.46}^{+0.59}(\text{syst}) $ pb is in goodagreement with the standard model prediction of $3.50\pm 0.21$. The same sampleis used to set limits on anomalous $WWZ$ couplings.

Combination of the top-quark mass measurements from the Tevatron  collider

  The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle, with a mass about 40times larger than the mass of its isospin partner, the bottom quark. It decaysalmost 100% of the time to a $W$ boson and a bottom quark. Using top-antitoppairs at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider, the CDF and {\dzero}collaborations have measured the top quark's mass in different final states forintegrated luminosities of up to 5.8 fb$^{-1}$. This paper reports on acombination of these measurements that results in a more precise value of themass than any individual decay channel can provide. It describes the treatmentof the systematic uncertainties and their correlations. The mass valuedetermined is $173.18 \pm 0.56 \thinspace ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.75 \thinspace({\rm syst})$ GeV or $173.18 \pm 0.94$ GeV, which has a precision of $\pm0.54%$, making this the most precise determination of the top quark mass.

Combination of CDF and D0 measurements of the W boson helicity in top  quark decays

  We report the combination of recent measurements of the helicity of the Wboson from top quark decay by the CDF and D0 collaborations, based on datasamples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.7 - 5.4 fb^-1 of ppbarcollisions collected during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Combiningmeasurements that simultaneously determine the fractions of W bosons withlongitudinal (f0) and right-handed (f+) helicities, we find f0 = 0.722 \pm0.081 [\pm 0.062 (stat.) \pm 0.052 (syst.)] and f+ = -0.033 \pm 0.046 [\pm0.034 (stat.) \pm 0.031 (syst.)]. Combining measurements where one of thehelicity fractions is fixed to the value expected in the standard model, wefind f0 = 0.682 \pm 0.057 [\pm 0.035 (stat.) \pm 0.046 (syst.)] and f+ =-0.015\pm0.035 [\pm 0.018 (stat.) \pm 0.030 (syst.)]. The results areconsistent with standard model expectations.
