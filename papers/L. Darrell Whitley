Fitness Probability Distribution of Bit-Flip Mutation

  Bit-flip mutation is a common mutation operator for evolutionary algorithmsapplied to optimize functions over binary strings. In this paper, we developresults from the theory of landscapes and Krawtchouk polynomials to exactlycompute the probability distribution of fitness values of a binary stringundergoing uniform bit-flip mutation. We prove that this probabilitydistribution can be expressed as a polynomial in p, the probability of flippingeach bit. We analyze these polynomials and provide closed-form expressions foran easy linear problem (Onemax), and an NP-hard problem, MAX-SAT. We alsodiscuss some implications of the results for runtime analysis.
