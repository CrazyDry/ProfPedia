Font Identification in Historical Documents Using Active Learning

  Identifying the type of font (e.g., Roman, Blackletter) used in historicaldocuments can help optical character recognition (OCR) systems produce moreaccurate text transcriptions. Towards this end, we present an active-learningstrategy that can significantly reduce the number of labeled samples needed totrain a font classifier. Our approach extracts image-based features thatexploit geometric differences between fonts at the word level, and combinesthem into a bag-of-word representation for each page in a document. We evaluatesix sampling strategies based on uncertainty, dissimilarity and diversitycriteria, and test them on a database containing over 3,000 historicaldocuments with Blackletter, Roman and Mixed fonts. Our results show that acombination of uncertainty and diversity achieves the highest predictiveaccuracy (89% of test cases correctly classified) while requiring only a smallfraction of the data (17%) to be labeled. We discuss the implications of thisresult for mass digitization projects of historical documents.

Recommendation of Scholarly Venues Based on Dynamic User Interests

  The ever-growing number of venues publishing academic work makes it difficultfor researchers to identify venues that publish data and research most in linewith their scholarly interests. A solution is needed, therefore, wherebyresearchers can identify information dissemination pathways in order to bothaccess and contribute to an existing body of knowledge. In this study, wepresent a system to recommend scholarly venues rated in terms of relevance to agiven researcher's current scholarly pursuits and interests. We collected ourdata from an academic social network and modeled researchers' scholarly readingbehavior in order to propose a new and adaptive implicit rating technique forvenues. We present a way to recommend relevant, specialized scholarly venuesusing these implicit ratings that can provide quick results, even for newresearchers without a publication history and for emerging scholarly venuesthat do not yet have an impact factor. We performed a large-scale experimentwith real data to evaluate the current scholarly recommendation system andshowed that our proposed system achieves better results than the baseline. Theresults provide important up-to-the-minute signals that compared withpost-publication usage-based metrics represent a closer reflection of aresearcher's interests.

Distributed Collections of Web Pages in the Wild

  As the Distributed Collection Manager's work on building tools to supportusers maintaining collections of changing web-based resources has progressed,questions about the characteristics of people's collections of web pages havearisen. Simultaneously, work in the areas of social bookmarking, social news,and subscription-based technologies have been taking the existence, usage, andutility of this data for granted with neither investigation into what peopleare doing with their collections nor how they are trying to maintain them. Inorder to address these concerns, we performed an online user study of 125individuals from a variety of online and offline communities, such as thereddit social news user community and the graduate student body in ourdepartment. From this study we were able to examine a user's needs for a systemto manage their web-based distributed collections, how their current toolsaffect their ability to maintain their collections, and what thecharacteristics of their current practices and problems in maintaining theirweb-based collections were. We also present extensions and improvements beingmade to the system both in order to adapt DCM for usage in the Ensemble projectand to meet the requirements found by our user study.

Anatomy of Scholarly Information Behavior Patterns in the Wake of  Academic Social Media Platforms

  As more scholarly content is born digital or converted to a digital format,digital libraries are becoming increasingly vital to researchers seeking toleverage scholarly big data for scientific discovery. Although scholarlyproducts are available in abundance-especially in environments created by theadvent of social networking services-little is known about internationalscholarly information needs, information-seeking behavior, or information use.The purpose of this paper is to address these gaps via an in-depth analysis ofthe information needs and information-seeking behavior of researchers, bothstudents and faculty, at two universities, one in the U.S. and the other inQatar. Based on this analysis, the study identifies and describes new behaviorpatterns on the part of researchers as they engage in the information-seekingprocess. The analysis reveals that the use of academic social networks hasnotable effects on various scholarly activities. Further, this study identifiesdifferences between students and faculty members in regard to their use ofacademic social networks, and it identifies differences between researchersaccording to discipline. Although the researchers who participated in thepresent study represent a range of disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, thestudy reports a number of similarities in terms of the researchers' scholarlyactivities.
