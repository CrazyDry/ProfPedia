Higher-Order Methods for Quantum Simulations

  To efficiently implement many-particle quantum simulations on quantumcomputers we develop and present methods for inverting theCampbell-Baker-Hausdorff lemma to 3rd and 4th order in the commutator. That is,we reexpress exp{-i(H_1 + H_2 + ...)dt} as a product of factors exp(-i H_1 dt),exp(-i H_2 dt), ... which is accurate to 3rd or 4th order in dt.

Probing shell structure and shape changes in neutron-rich sulfur  isotopes through transient-field g factor measurements on fast radioactive  beams of 38S and 40S

  The shell structure underlying shape changes in neutron-rich nuclei near N=28has been investigated by a novel application of the transient field techniqueto measure the first-excited state g factors in 38S and 40S produced as fastradioactive beams. There is a fine balance between proton and neutroncontributions to the magnetic moments in both nuclei. The g factor of deformed40S does not resemble that of a conventional collective nucleus because spincontributions are more important than usual.

Continuous all-optical deceleration and single-photon cooling of  molecular beams

  Ultracold molecular gases are promising as an avenue to rich many-bodyphysics, quantum chemistry, quantum information, and precision measurements.This richness, which flows from the complex internal structure of molecules,makes the creation of ultracold molecular gases using traditional methods(laser plus evaporative cooling) a challenge, in particular due to thespontaneous decay of molecules into dark states. We propose a way to circumventthis key bottleneck using an all-optical method for decelerating moleculesusing stimulated absorption and emission with a single ultrafast laser. Wefurther describe single-photon cooling of the decelerating molecules thatexploits their high dark state pumping rates, turning the principal obstacle tomolecular laser cooling into an advantage. Cooling and deceleration may beapplied simultaneously and continuously to load molecules into a trap. Wediscuss implementation details including multi-level numerical simulations ofstrontium monohydride (SrH). These techniques are applicable to a large numberof molecular species and atoms with the only requirement being an electricdipole transition that can be accessed with an ultrafast laser.

A biological model of scabies infection dynamics and treatment explains  why mass drug administration does not lead to elimination

  Despite a low global prevalence, infections with Sarcoptes scabiei, orscabies, are still common in remote communities such as in northern Australiaand the Solomon Islands. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been utilised inthese communities, and although prevalence drops substantially initially, thesereductions have not been sustained. We develop a compartmental model of scabiesinfection dynamics and incorporate both ovicidal and non-ovicidal treatmentregimes. By including the dynamics of mass drug administration, we are able toreproduce the phenomena of an initial reduction in prevalence, followed by therecrudescence of infection levels in the population. We show that even under a`perfect' two-round MDA, eradication of scabies under a non-ovicidal treatmentscheme is almost impossible. We then go on to consider how the probability ofelimination varies with the number of treatment rounds delivered in an MDA. Wefind that even with infeasibly large numbers of treatment rounds, eliminationremains challenging.

Shell structure underlying the evolution of quadrupole collectivity in  S-38 and S-40 probed by transient-field g-factor measurements on fast  radioactive beams

  The shell structure underlying shape changes in neutron-rich nuclei betweenN=20 and N=28 has been investigated by a novel application of the transientfield technique to measure the first-excited state g factors in S-38 and S-40produced as fast radioactive beams. Details of the new methodology arepresented. In both S-38 and S-40 there is a fine balance between the proton andneutron contributions to the magnetic moments. Shell model calculations whichdescribe the level schemes and quadrupole properties of these nuclei also givea satisfactory explanation of the g factors. In S-38 the g factor is extremelysensitive to the occupation of the neutron p3/2 orbit above the N=28 shell gapas occupation of this orbit strongly affects the proton configuration. The gfactor of deformed S-40 does not resemble that of a conventional collectivenucleus because spin contributions are more important than usual.

The XMM Cluster Survey: X-ray analysis methodology

  The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) is a serendipitous search for galaxy clustersusing all publicly available data in the XMM-Newton Science Archive. Its mainaims are to measure cosmological parameters and trace the evolution of X-rayscaling relations. In this paper we describe the data processing methodologyapplied to the 5,776 XMM observations used to construct the current XCS sourcecatalogue. A total of 3,675 > 4-sigma cluster candidates with > 50background-subtracted X-ray counts are extracted from a total non-overlappingarea suitable for cluster searching of 410 deg^2. Of these, 993 candidates aredetected with > 300 background-subtracted X-ray photon counts, and wedemonstrate that robust temperature measurements can be obtained down to thiscount limit. We describe in detail the automated pipelines used to perform thespectral and surface brightness fitting for these candidates, as well as toestimate redshifts from the X-ray data alone. A total of 587 (122) X-raytemperatures to a typical accuracy of < 40 (< 10) per cent have been measuredto date. We also present the methodology adopted for determining the selectionfunction of the survey, and show that the extended source detection algorithmis robust to a range of cluster morphologies by inserting mock clusters derivedfrom hydrodynamical simulations into real XMM images. These tests show that thesimple isothermal beta-profiles is sufficient to capture the essential detailsof the cluster population detected in the archival XMM observations. Theredshift follow-up of the XCS cluster sample is presented in a companion paper,together with a first data release of 503 optically-confirmed clusters.

The XMM Cluster Survey: Optical analysis methodology and the first data  release

  The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) is a serendipitous search for galaxy clustersusing all publicly available data in the XMM-Newton Science Archive. Its mainaims are to measure cosmological parameters and trace the evolution of X-rayscaling relations. In this paper we present the first data release from the XMMCluster Survey (XCS-DR1). This consists of 503 optically confirmed,serendipitously detected, X-ray clusters. Of these clusters, 255 are new to theliterature and 356 are new X-ray discoveries. We present 464 clusters with aredshift estimate (0.06 < z < 1.46), including 261 clusters with spectroscopicredshifts. In addition, we have measured X-ray temperatures (Tx) for 402clusters (0.4 < Tx < 14.7 keV). We highlight seven interesting subsamples ofXCS-DR1 clusters: (i) 10 clusters at high redshift (z > 1.0, including a newspectroscopically-confirmed cluster at z = 1.01); (ii) 67 clusters with high Tx(> 5 keV); (iii) 131 clusters/groups with low Tx (< 2 keV); (iv) 27 clusterswith measured Tx values in the SDSS `Stripe 82' co-add region; (v) 78 clusterswith measured Tx values in the Dark Energy Survey region; (vi) 40 clustersdetected with sufficient counts to permit mass measurements (under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium); (vii) 105 clusters that can be used forapplications such as the derivation of cosmological parameters and themeasurement of cluster scaling relations. The X-ray analysis methodology usedto construct and analyse the XCS-DR1 cluster sample has been presented in acompanion paper, Lloyd-Davies et al. (2010).

The Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey

  This paper describes the data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II(SDSS-II) Supernova Survey conducted between 2005 and 2007. Light curves,spectra, classifications, and ancillary data are presented for 10,258 variableand transient sources discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe82, a 300 deg2 area along the celestial equator. This data release is comprisedof all transient sources brighter than r~22.5 mag with no history ofvariability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performedon a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transienthost galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometricclassifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color lightcurves that were not observed spectroscopically. From these observations, 4607transients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae,making this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. Wepresent a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxyproperties including stellar masses, star-formation rates, and the averagestellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2distance moduli for a total of 1443 SN Ia with spectroscopic redshifts as wellas photometric redshifts for a further 677 purely-photometric SN Ia candidates.Using the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SN Iasample and assuming a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, we determine Omega_M = 0.315+/- 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constantat 5.7 sigmas.

The 2010 Interim Report of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment  Collaboration Physics Working Groups

  In early 2010, the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) sciencecollaboration initiated a study to investigate the physics potential of theexperiment with a broad set of different beam, near- and far-detectorconfigurations. Nine initial topics were identified as scientific areas thatmotivate construction of a long-baseline neutrino experiment with a very largefar detector. We summarize the scientific justification for each topic and theestimated performance for a set of far detector reference configurations. Wereport also on a study of optimized beam parameters and the physics capabilityof proposed Near Detector configurations. This document was presented to thecollaboration in fall 2010 and updated with minor modifications in early 2011.

Cold-nuclear-matter effects on heavy-quark production at forward and  backward rapidity in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV

  The PHENIX experiment has measured open heavy-flavor production viasemileptonic decay muons over the transverse momentum range 1 < pT < 6 GeV/c atforward and backward rapidity (1.4 < |y| < 2.0) in d+Au and p+p collisions at?sNN = 200 GeV. In central d+Au collisions an enhancement (suppression) ofheavy-flavor muon production is observed at backward (forward) rapidityrelative to the yield in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binarycollisions. Modification of the gluon density distribution in the Au nucleuscontributes in terms of anti-shadowing enhancement and shadowing suppression;however, the enhancement seen at backward rapidity exceeds expectations fromthis effect alone. These results, implying an important role for additionalcold nuclear matter effects, serves as a key baseline for heavy-quarkmeasurements in A+A collisions and in constraining the magnitude of charmoniabreakup effects at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large HadronCollider.

Inclusive cross sections, charge ratio and double-helicity asymmetries  for $π^+$ and $π^-$ production in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200  GeV

  We present the midrapidity charged pion invariant cross sections and theratio of $\pi^-$-to-$\pi^+$ production ($5<p_T<13$ GeV/$c$), together with thedouble-helicity asymmetries ($5<p_T<12$ GeV/$c$) in polarized $p$$+$$p$collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. The cross section measurements areconsistent with perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics withinlarge uncertainties in the calculation due to the choice of factorization,renormalization, and fragmentation scales. However, the theoretical calculationof the ratio of $\pi^-$-to-$\pi^+$ production when considering these scaleuncertainties overestimates the measured value, suggesting furtherinvestigation of the uncertainties on the charge-separated pion fragmentationfunctions is needed. Due to cancellations of uncertainties in the charge ratio,direct inclusion of these ratio data in future parameterizations should improveconstraints on the flavor dependence of quark fragmentation functions to pions.By measuring charge-separated pion asymmetries, one can gain sensitivity to thesign of $\Delta G$ through the opposite sign of the up and down quark helicitydistributions in conjunction with preferential fragmentation of positive pionsfrom up quarks and negative pions from down quarks. The double-helicityasymmetries presented are sensitive to the gluon helicity distribution over an$x$ range of $\sim$0.03--0.16.

Double Spin Asymmetry of Electrons from Heavy Flavor Decays in p+p  Collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV

  We report on the first measurement of double-spin asymmetry, A_LL, ofelectrons from the decays of hadrons containing heavy flavor in longitudinallypolarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV for p_T= 0.5 to 3.0 GeV/c. Theasymmetry was measured at mid-rapidity (|eta|<0.35) with the PHENIX detector atthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The measured asymmetries are consistentwith zero within the statistical errors. We obtained a constraint for thepolarized gluon distribution in the proton of |Delta g/g(log{_10}x=-1.6^+0.5_-0.4, {mu}=m_T^c)|^2 < 0.033 (1 sigma), based on a leading-orderperturbative-quantum-chromodynamics model, using the measured asymmetry.

Inclusive double-helicity asymmetries in neutral pion and eta meson  production in $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV

  Results are presented from data recorded in 2009 by the PHENIX experiment atthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider for the double-longitudinal spin asymmetry,$A_{LL}$, for $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ production in $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV polarized$p$$+$$p$ collisions. Comparison of the $\pi^0$ results with different theoryexpectations based on fits of other published data showed a preference forsmall positive values of gluon polarization, $\Delta G$, in the proton in theprobed Bjorken $x$ range. The effect of adding the new 2009 \pz data to arecent global analysis of polarized scattering data is also shown, resulting ina best fit value $\Delta G^{[0.05,0.2]}_{\mbox{DSSV}} = 0.06^{+0.11}_{-0.15}$in the range $0.05<x<0.2$, with the uncertainty at $\Delta \chi^2 = 9$ whenconsidering only statistical experimental uncertainties. Shifting the PHENIXdata points by their systematic uncertainty leads to a variation of thebest-fit value of $\Delta G^{[0.05,0.2]}_{\mbox{DSSV}}$ between $0.02$ and$0.12$, demonstrating the need for full treatment of the experimentalsystematic uncertainties in future global analyses.

Cross Section and Parity Violating Spin Asymmetries of W^+/- Boson  Production in Polarized p+p Collisions at sqrt(s)=500 GeV

  Large parity violating longitudinal single spin asymmetries A^{e^-}_L=-0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.30} and A^{e^+}_L= 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.71} are observed forinclusive high transverse momentum electrons and positrons in polarized ppcollisions at a center of mass energy of \sqrt{s}=500\ GeV with the PHENIXdetector at RHIC. These e^{+/-} come mainly from the decay of W^{+/-} and Z^0bosons, and the asymmetries directly demonstrate parity violation in thecouplings of the W^{\pm} to the light quarks. The observed electron andpositron yields were used to estimate W^\pm boson production cross sectionsequal to \sigma(pp \to W^+ X) \times BR(W^ \to \nu_e)=144.1+/-21.2(stat)^{+3.4}_{-10.3}(syst) +/- 15%(norm) pb, and \sigma(pp \toW^{-}X) \times BR(W^\to e^-\bar{\nu_e}) =31.7+/-12.1(stat)^{+10.1}_{-8.2}(syst)+/-15%(norm) pb.

Measurements of elliptic and triangular flow in high-multiplicity  $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV

  We present the first measurement of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$)flow in high-multiplicity $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$GeV. Two-particle correlations, where the particles have a large separation inpseudorapidity, are compared in $^{3}$He$+$Au and in $p$$+$$p$ collisions andindicate that collective effects dominate the second and third Fouriercomponents for the correlations observed in the $^{3}$He$+$Au system. Thecollective behavior is quantified in terms of elliptic $v_2$ and triangular$v_3$ anisotropy coefficients measured with respect to their correspondingevent planes. The $v_2$ values are comparable to those previously measured in$d$$+$Au collisions at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy.Comparison with various theoretical predictions are made, including to modelswhere the hot spots created by the impact of the three $^{3}$He nucleons on theAu nucleus expand hydrodynamically to generate the triangular flow. Theagreement of these models with data may indicate the formation of low-viscosityquark-gluon plasma even in these small collision systems.

Search for dark photons from neutral meson decays in $p$$+$$p$ and  $d$$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV

  The standard model (SM) of particle physics is spectacularly successful, yetthe measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_\mu$ deviatesfrom SM calculations by 3.6$\sigma$. Several theoretical models attribute thisto the existence of a "dark photon," an additional U(1) gauge boson, which isweakly coupled to ordinary photons. The PHENIX experiment at the RelativisticHeavy Ion Collider has searched for a dark photon, $U$, in $\pi^0,\eta\rightarrow \gamma e^+e^-$ decays and obtained upper limits of$\mathcal{O}(2\times10^{-6})$ on $U$-$\gamma$ mixing at 90% CL for the massrange $30<m_U<90$ MeV/$c^2$. Combined with other experimental limits, theremaining region in the $U$-$\gamma$ mixing parameter space that can explainthe $(g-2)_\mu$ deviation from its SM value is nearly completely excluded atthe 90% confidence level, with only a small region of $29<m_U<32$ MeV/$c^2$remaining.

$φ$ meson production in the forward/backward rapidity region in  Cu$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV

  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) hasmeasured $\phi$ meson production and its nuclear modification in asymmetricCu$+$Au heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at both forwardCu-going direction ($1.2<y<2.2$) and backward Au-going direction($-2.2<y<-1.2$), rapidities. The measurements are performed via the dimuondecay channel and reported as a function of the number of participatingnucleons, rapidity, and transverse momentum. In the most central events,0\%--20\% centrality, the $\phi$ meson yield integrated over $1<p_T<5$ GeV/$c$prefers a smaller value, which means a larger nuclear modification, in theCu-going direction compared to the Au-going direction. Additionally, thenuclear-modification factor in Cu$+$Au collisions averaged over all centralityis measured to be similar to the previous PHENIX result in $d$$+$Au collisionsfor these rapidities.

Upsilon (1S+2S+3S) production in d+Au and p+p collisions at  sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and cold-nuclear matter effects

  The three Upsilon states, Upsilon(1S+2S+3S), are measured in d+Au and p+pcollisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and rapidities 1.2<|y|<2.2 by the PHENIXexperiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. Cross sections for theinclusive Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) production are obtained. The inclusive yields perbinary collision for d+Au collisions relative to those in p+p collisions(R_dAu) are found to be 0.62 +/- 0.26 (stat) +/- 0.13 (syst) in the gold-goingdirection and 0.91 +/- 0.33 (stat) +/- 0.16 (syst) in the deuteron-goingdirection. The measured results are compared to a nuclear-shadowing model,EPS09 [JHEP 04, 065 (2009)], combined with a final-state breakup cross section,sigma_br, and compared to lower energy p+A results. We also compare the resultsto the PHENIX J/psi results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 142301 (2011)]. The rapiditydependence of the observed Upsilon suppression is consistent with lower energyp+A measurements.

Low-mass vector-meson production at forward rapidity in $p$$+$$p$  collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV

  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured lowmass vector meson, $\omega$, $\rho$, and $\phi$, production through the dimuondecay channel at forward rapidity ($1.2<|y|<2.2$) in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at$\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. The differential cross sections for these mesons aremeasured as a function of both $p_T$ and rapidity. We also report theintegrated differential cross sections over $1<p_T<7$ GeV/$c$ and$1.2<|y|<2.2$: $d\sigma/dy(\omega+\rho\rightarrow\mu\mu) = 80 \pm 6\mbox{(stat)} \pm 12 \mbox{(syst)}$ nb and $d\sigma/dy(\phi\rightarrow\mu\mu) =27 \pm 3 \mbox{(stat)} \pm 4 \mbox{(syst)}$ nb. These results are compared withmidrapidity measurements and calculations.

Measurement of long-range angular correlation and quadrupole anisotropy  of pions and (anti)protons in central $d$$+$Au collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV

  We present azimuthal angular correlations between charged hadrons and energydeposited in calorimeter towers in central $d$$+$Au and minimum bias $p$$+$$p$collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The charged hadron is measured atmidrapidity $|\eta|<0.35$, and the energy is measured at large rapidity($-3.7<\eta<-3.1$, Au-going direction). An enhanced near-side angularcorrelation across $|\Delta\eta| >$ 2.75 is observed in $d$$+$Au collisions.Using the event plane method applied to the Au-going energy distribution, weextract the anisotropy strength $v_2$ for inclusive charged hadrons atmidrapidity up to $p_T=4.5$ GeV/$c$. We also present the measurement of $v_2$for identified $\pi^{\pm}$ and (anti)protons in central $d$$+$Au collisions,and observe a mass-ordering pattern similar to that seen in heavy ioncollisions. These results are compared with viscous hydrodynamic calculationsand measurements from $p$$+$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The magnitude ofthe mass-ordering in $d$$+$Au is found to be smaller than that in $p$$+$Pbcollisions, which may indicate smaller radial flow in lower energy $d$$+$Aucollisions.

The Eighth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First Data from  SDSS-III

  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in August 2008, withnew instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure and chemicalevolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering ofgalaxies and the quasar Ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search forplanets around ~8000 stars. This paper describes the first data release ofSDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The releaseincludes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the Southern Galactic Cap,bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over athird of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed withan improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometricrecalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all datafrom the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding andEvolution (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 starsat both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a millionstellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessedthrough an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determinationof metallicity for high metallicity stars.

SDSS-III: Massive Spectroscopic Surveys of the Distant Universe, the  Milky Way Galaxy, and Extra-Solar Planetary Systems

  Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and II),SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the MilkyWay, and the population of giant planets around other stars. In keeping withSDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data,beginning with SDSS DR8 (which occurred in Jan 2011). This paper presents anoverview of the four SDSS-III surveys. BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.5million massive galaxies and Lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using theBAO feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations ofthe distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z<0.7 and at z~2.5. SEGUE-2,which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (R=1800) optical spectra of118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matterhalo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE will obtainhigh-resolution (R~30,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N>100 per resolutionelement), H-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the firsthigh-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge,bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectraldiagnostics. MARVELS will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 FGK starswith the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed todetect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedenteddata set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giantplanet systems.

Observation of the rare $B^0_s\toμ^+μ^-$ decay from the combined  analysis of CMS and LHCb data

  A joint measurement is presented of the branching fractions$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ in proton-proton collisions at theLHC by the CMS and LHCb experiments. The data samples were collected in 2011 ata centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and in 2012 at 8 TeV. The combined analysisproduces the first observation of the $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, with astatistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the bestmeasurement of its branching fraction so far. Furthermore, evidence for the$B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay is obtained with a statistical significance of threestandard deviations. The branching fraction measurements are statisticallycompatible with SM predictions and impose stringent constraints on severaltheories beyond the SM.
