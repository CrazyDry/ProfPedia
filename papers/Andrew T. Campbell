Higher-Order Methods for Quantum Simulations

  To efficiently implement many-particle quantum simulations on quantum
computers we develop and present methods for inverting the
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff lemma to 3rd and 4th order in the commutator. That is,
we reexpress exp{-i(H_1 + H_2 + ...)dt} as a product of factors exp(-i H_1 dt),
exp(-i H_2 dt), ... which is accurate to 3rd or 4th order in dt.


Probing shell structure and shape changes in neutron-rich sulfur
  isotopes through transient-field g factor measurements on fast radioactive
  beams of 38S and 40S

  The shell structure underlying shape changes in neutron-rich nuclei near N=28
has been investigated by a novel application of the transient field technique
to measure the first-excited state g factors in 38S and 40S produced as fast
radioactive beams. There is a fine balance between proton and neutron
contributions to the magnetic moments in both nuclei. The g factor of deformed
40S does not resemble that of a conventional collective nucleus because spin
contributions are more important than usual.


Continuous all-optical deceleration and single-photon cooling of
  molecular beams

  Ultracold molecular gases are promising as an avenue to rich many-body
physics, quantum chemistry, quantum information, and precision measurements.
This richness, which flows from the complex internal structure of molecules,
makes the creation of ultracold molecular gases using traditional methods
(laser plus evaporative cooling) a challenge, in particular due to the
spontaneous decay of molecules into dark states. We propose a way to circumvent
this key bottleneck using an all-optical method for decelerating molecules
using stimulated absorption and emission with a single ultrafast laser. We
further describe single-photon cooling of the decelerating molecules that
exploits their high dark state pumping rates, turning the principal obstacle to
molecular laser cooling into an advantage. Cooling and deceleration may be
applied simultaneously and continuously to load molecules into a trap. We
discuss implementation details including multi-level numerical simulations of
strontium monohydride (SrH). These techniques are applicable to a large number
of molecular species and atoms with the only requirement being an electric
dipole transition that can be accessed with an ultrafast laser.


A biological model of scabies infection dynamics and treatment explains
  why mass drug administration does not lead to elimination

  Despite a low global prevalence, infections with Sarcoptes scabiei, or
scabies, are still common in remote communities such as in northern Australia
and the Solomon Islands. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been utilised in
these communities, and although prevalence drops substantially initially, these
reductions have not been sustained. We develop a compartmental model of scabies
infection dynamics and incorporate both ovicidal and non-ovicidal treatment
regimes. By including the dynamics of mass drug administration, we are able to
reproduce the phenomena of an initial reduction in prevalence, followed by the
recrudescence of infection levels in the population. We show that even under a
`perfect' two-round MDA, eradication of scabies under a non-ovicidal treatment
scheme is almost impossible. We then go on to consider how the probability of
elimination varies with the number of treatment rounds delivered in an MDA. We
find that even with infeasibly large numbers of treatment rounds, elimination
remains challenging.


Shell structure underlying the evolution of quadrupole collectivity in
  S-38 and S-40 probed by transient-field g-factor measurements on fast
  radioactive beams

  The shell structure underlying shape changes in neutron-rich nuclei between
N=20 and N=28 has been investigated by a novel application of the transient
field technique to measure the first-excited state g factors in S-38 and S-40
produced as fast radioactive beams. Details of the new methodology are
presented. In both S-38 and S-40 there is a fine balance between the proton and
neutron contributions to the magnetic moments. Shell model calculations which
describe the level schemes and quadrupole properties of these nuclei also give
a satisfactory explanation of the g factors. In S-38 the g factor is extremely
sensitive to the occupation of the neutron p3/2 orbit above the N=28 shell gap
as occupation of this orbit strongly affects the proton configuration. The g
factor of deformed S-40 does not resemble that of a conventional collective
nucleus because spin contributions are more important than usual.


The XMM Cluster Survey: X-ray analysis methodology

  The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) is a serendipitous search for galaxy clusters
using all publicly available data in the XMM-Newton Science Archive. Its main
aims are to measure cosmological parameters and trace the evolution of X-ray
scaling relations. In this paper we describe the data processing methodology
applied to the 5,776 XMM observations used to construct the current XCS source
catalogue. A total of 3,675 > 4-sigma cluster candidates with > 50
background-subtracted X-ray counts are extracted from a total non-overlapping
area suitable for cluster searching of 410 deg^2. Of these, 993 candidates are
detected with > 300 background-subtracted X-ray photon counts, and we
demonstrate that robust temperature measurements can be obtained down to this
count limit. We describe in detail the automated pipelines used to perform the
spectral and surface brightness fitting for these candidates, as well as to
estimate redshifts from the X-ray data alone. A total of 587 (122) X-ray
temperatures to a typical accuracy of < 40 (< 10) per cent have been measured
to date. We also present the methodology adopted for determining the selection
function of the survey, and show that the extended source detection algorithm
is robust to a range of cluster morphologies by inserting mock clusters derived
from hydrodynamical simulations into real XMM images. These tests show that the
simple isothermal beta-profiles is sufficient to capture the essential details
of the cluster population detected in the archival XMM observations. The
redshift follow-up of the XCS cluster sample is presented in a companion paper,
together with a first data release of 503 optically-confirmed clusters.


The XMM Cluster Survey: Optical analysis methodology and the first data
  release

  The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) is a serendipitous search for galaxy clusters
using all publicly available data in the XMM-Newton Science Archive. Its main
aims are to measure cosmological parameters and trace the evolution of X-ray
scaling relations. In this paper we present the first data release from the XMM
Cluster Survey (XCS-DR1). This consists of 503 optically confirmed,
serendipitously detected, X-ray clusters. Of these clusters, 255 are new to the
literature and 356 are new X-ray discoveries. We present 464 clusters with a
redshift estimate (0.06 < z < 1.46), including 261 clusters with spectroscopic
redshifts. In addition, we have measured X-ray temperatures (Tx) for 402
clusters (0.4 < Tx < 14.7 keV). We highlight seven interesting subsamples of
XCS-DR1 clusters: (i) 10 clusters at high redshift (z > 1.0, including a new
spectroscopically-confirmed cluster at z = 1.01); (ii) 67 clusters with high Tx
(> 5 keV); (iii) 131 clusters/groups with low Tx (< 2 keV); (iv) 27 clusters
with measured Tx values in the SDSS `Stripe 82' co-add region; (v) 78 clusters
with measured Tx values in the Dark Energy Survey region; (vi) 40 clusters
detected with sufficient counts to permit mass measurements (under the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium); (vii) 105 clusters that can be used for
applications such as the derivation of cosmological parameters and the
measurement of cluster scaling relations. The X-ray analysis methodology used
to construct and analyse the XCS-DR1 cluster sample has been presented in a
companion paper, Lloyd-Davies et al. (2010).


The Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey

  This paper describes the data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II
(SDSS-II) Supernova Survey conducted between 2005 and 2007. Light curves,
spectra, classifications, and ancillary data are presented for 10,258 variable
and transient sources discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe
82, a 300 deg2 area along the celestial equator. This data release is comprised
of all transient sources brighter than r~22.5 mag with no history of
variability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performed
on a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transient
host galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometric
classifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light
curves that were not observed spectroscopically. From these observations, 4607
transients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae,
making this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We
present a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy
properties including stellar masses, star-formation rates, and the average
stellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2
distance moduli for a total of 1443 SN Ia with spectroscopic redshifts as well
as photometric redshifts for a further 677 purely-photometric SN Ia candidates.
Using the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SN Ia
sample and assuming a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, we determine Omega_M = 0.315
+/- 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant
at 5.7 sigmas.

Dark Matter" held at University of Maryland on March 23-25, 2017.


The 2010 Interim Report of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment
  Collaboration Physics Working Groups

  In early 2010, the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) science
collaboration initiated a study to investigate the physics potential of the
experiment with a broad set of different beam, near- and far-detector
configurations. Nine initial topics were identified as scientific areas that
motivate construction of a long-baseline neutrino experiment with a very large
far detector. We summarize the scientific justification for each topic and the
estimated performance for a set of far detector reference configurations. We
report also on a study of optimized beam parameters and the physics capability
of proposed Near Detector configurations. This document was presented to the
collaboration in fall 2010 and updated with minor modifications in early 2011.


Cold-nuclear-matter effects on heavy-quark production at forward and
  backward rapidity in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV

  The PHENIX experiment has measured open heavy-flavor production via
semileptonic decay muons over the transverse momentum range 1 < pT < 6 GeV/c at
forward and backward rapidity (1.4 < |y| < 2.0) in d+Au and p+p collisions at
?sNN = 200 GeV. In central d+Au collisions an enhancement (suppression) of
heavy-flavor muon production is observed at backward (forward) rapidity
relative to the yield in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary
collisions. Modification of the gluon density distribution in the Au nucleus
contributes in terms of anti-shadowing enhancement and shadowing suppression;
however, the enhancement seen at backward rapidity exceeds expectations from
this effect alone. These results, implying an important role for additional
cold nuclear matter effects, serves as a key baseline for heavy-quark
measurements in A+A collisions and in constraining the magnitude of charmonia
breakup effects at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron
Collider.


Inclusive cross sections, charge ratio and double-helicity asymmetries
  for $π^+$ and $π^-$ production in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200
  GeV

  We present the midrapidity charged pion invariant cross sections and the
ratio of $\pi^-$-to-$\pi^+$ production ($5<p_T<13$ GeV/$c$), together with the
double-helicity asymmetries ($5<p_T<12$ GeV/$c$) in polarized $p$$+$$p$
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. The cross section measurements are
consistent with perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics within
large uncertainties in the calculation due to the choice of factorization,
renormalization, and fragmentation scales. However, the theoretical calculation
of the ratio of $\pi^-$-to-$\pi^+$ production when considering these scale
uncertainties overestimates the measured value, suggesting further
investigation of the uncertainties on the charge-separated pion fragmentation
functions is needed. Due to cancellations of uncertainties in the charge ratio,
direct inclusion of these ratio data in future parameterizations should improve
constraints on the flavor dependence of quark fragmentation functions to pions.
By measuring charge-separated pion asymmetries, one can gain sensitivity to the
sign of $\Delta G$ through the opposite sign of the up and down quark helicity
distributions in conjunction with preferential fragmentation of positive pions
from up quarks and negative pions from down quarks. The double-helicity
asymmetries presented are sensitive to the gluon helicity distribution over an
$x$ range of $\sim$0.03--0.16.


Double Spin Asymmetry of Electrons from Heavy Flavor Decays in p+p
  Collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV

  We report on the first measurement of double-spin asymmetry, A_LL, of
electrons from the decays of hadrons containing heavy flavor in longitudinally
polarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV for p_T= 0.5 to 3.0 GeV/c. The
asymmetry was measured at mid-rapidity (|eta|<0.35) with the PHENIX detector at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The measured asymmetries are consistent
with zero within the statistical errors. We obtained a constraint for the
polarized gluon distribution in the proton of |Delta g/g(log{_10}x=
-1.6^+0.5_-0.4, {mu}=m_T^c)|^2 < 0.033 (1 sigma), based on a leading-order
perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics model, using the measured asymmetry.


Inclusive double-helicity asymmetries in neutral pion and eta meson
  production in $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV

  Results are presented from data recorded in 2009 by the PHENIX experiment at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider for the double-longitudinal spin asymmetry,
$A_{LL}$, for $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ production in $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV polarized
$p$$+$$p$ collisions. Comparison of the $\pi^0$ results with different theory
expectations based on fits of other published data showed a preference for
small positive values of gluon polarization, $\Delta G$, in the proton in the
probed Bjorken $x$ range. The effect of adding the new 2009 \pz data to a
recent global analysis of polarized scattering data is also shown, resulting in
a best fit value $\Delta G^{[0.05,0.2]}_{\mbox{DSSV}} = 0.06^{+0.11}_{-0.15}$
in the range $0.05<x<0.2$, with the uncertainty at $\Delta \chi^2 = 9$ when
considering only statistical experimental uncertainties. Shifting the PHENIX
data points by their systematic uncertainty leads to a variation of the
best-fit value of $\Delta G^{[0.05,0.2]}_{\mbox{DSSV}}$ between $0.02$ and
$0.12$, demonstrating the need for full treatment of the experimental
systematic uncertainties in future global analyses.


Cross Section and Parity Violating Spin Asymmetries of W^+/- Boson
  Production in Polarized p+p Collisions at sqrt(s)=500 GeV

  Large parity violating longitudinal single spin asymmetries A^{e^-}_L=
-0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.30} and A^{e^+}_L= 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.71} are observed for
inclusive high transverse momentum electrons and positrons in polarized pp
collisions at a center of mass energy of \sqrt{s}=500\ GeV with the PHENIX
detector at RHIC. These e^{+/-} come mainly from the decay of W^{+/-} and Z^0
bosons, and the asymmetries directly demonstrate parity violation in the
couplings of the W^{\pm} to the light quarks. The observed electron and
positron yields were used to estimate W^\pm boson production cross sections
equal to \sigma(pp \to W^+ X) \times BR(W^ \to \nu_e)=
144.1+/-21.2(stat)^{+3.4}_{-10.3}(syst) +/- 15%(norm) pb, and \sigma(pp \to
W^{-}X) \times BR(W^\to e^-\bar{\nu_e}) =
31.7+/-12.1(stat)^{+10.1}_{-8.2}(syst)+/-15%(norm) pb.


Measurements of elliptic and triangular flow in high-multiplicity
  $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV

  We present the first measurement of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$)
flow in high-multiplicity $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$
GeV. Two-particle correlations, where the particles have a large separation in
pseudorapidity, are compared in $^{3}$He$+$Au and in $p$$+$$p$ collisions and
indicate that collective effects dominate the second and third Fourier
components for the correlations observed in the $^{3}$He$+$Au system. The
collective behavior is quantified in terms of elliptic $v_2$ and triangular
$v_3$ anisotropy coefficients measured with respect to their corresponding
event planes. The $v_2$ values are comparable to those previously measured in
$d$$+$Au collisions at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy.
Comparison with various theoretical predictions are made, including to models
where the hot spots created by the impact of the three $^{3}$He nucleons on the
Au nucleus expand hydrodynamically to generate the triangular flow. The
agreement of these models with data may indicate the formation of low-viscosity
quark-gluon plasma even in these small collision systems.


Search for dark photons from neutral meson decays in $p$$+$$p$ and
  $d$$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV

  The standard model (SM) of particle physics is spectacularly successful, yet
the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_\mu$ deviates
from SM calculations by 3.6$\sigma$. Several theoretical models attribute this
to the existence of a "dark photon," an additional U(1) gauge boson, which is
weakly coupled to ordinary photons. The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider has searched for a dark photon, $U$, in $\pi^0,\eta
\rightarrow \gamma e^+e^-$ decays and obtained upper limits of
$\mathcal{O}(2\times10^{-6})$ on $U$-$\gamma$ mixing at 90% CL for the mass
range $30<m_U<90$ MeV/$c^2$. Combined with other experimental limits, the
remaining region in the $U$-$\gamma$ mixing parameter space that can explain
the $(g-2)_\mu$ deviation from its SM value is nearly completely excluded at
the 90% confidence level, with only a small region of $29<m_U<32$ MeV/$c^2$
remaining.


$φ$ meson production in the forward/backward rapidity region in
  Cu$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV

  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has
measured $\phi$ meson production and its nuclear modification in asymmetric
Cu$+$Au heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at both forward
Cu-going direction ($1.2<y<2.2$) and backward Au-going direction
($-2.2<y<-1.2$), rapidities. The measurements are performed via the dimuon
decay channel and reported as a function of the number of participating
nucleons, rapidity, and transverse momentum. In the most central events,
0\%--20\% centrality, the $\phi$ meson yield integrated over $1<p_T<5$ GeV/$c$
prefers a smaller value, which means a larger nuclear modification, in the
Cu-going direction compared to the Au-going direction. Additionally, the
nuclear-modification factor in Cu$+$Au collisions averaged over all centrality
is measured to be similar to the previous PHENIX result in $d$$+$Au collisions
for these rapidities.


Upsilon (1S+2S+3S) production in d+Au and p+p collisions at
  sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and cold-nuclear matter effects

  The three Upsilon states, Upsilon(1S+2S+3S), are measured in d+Au and p+p
collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and rapidities 1.2<|y|<2.2 by the PHENIX
experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. Cross sections for the
inclusive Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) production are obtained. The inclusive yields per
binary collision for d+Au collisions relative to those in p+p collisions
(R_dAu) are found to be 0.62 +/- 0.26 (stat) +/- 0.13 (syst) in the gold-going
direction and 0.91 +/- 0.33 (stat) +/- 0.16 (syst) in the deuteron-going
direction. The measured results are compared to a nuclear-shadowing model,
EPS09 [JHEP 04, 065 (2009)], combined with a final-state breakup cross section,
sigma_br, and compared to lower energy p+A results. We also compare the results
to the PHENIX J/psi results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 142301 (2011)]. The rapidity
dependence of the observed Upsilon suppression is consistent with lower energy
p+A measurements.


Low-mass vector-meson production at forward rapidity in $p$$+$$p$
  collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV

  The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured low
mass vector meson, $\omega$, $\rho$, and $\phi$, production through the dimuon
decay channel at forward rapidity ($1.2<|y|<2.2$) in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. The differential cross sections for these mesons are
measured as a function of both $p_T$ and rapidity. We also report the
integrated differential cross sections over $1<p_T<7$ GeV/$c$ and
$1.2<|y|<2.2$: $d\sigma/dy(\omega+\rho\rightarrow\mu\mu) = 80 \pm 6
\mbox{(stat)} \pm 12 \mbox{(syst)}$ nb and $d\sigma/dy(\phi\rightarrow\mu\mu) =
27 \pm 3 \mbox{(stat)} \pm 4 \mbox{(syst)}$ nb. These results are compared with
midrapidity measurements and calculations.


Measurement of long-range angular correlation and quadrupole anisotropy
  of pions and (anti)protons in central $d$$+$Au collisions at
  $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV

  We present azimuthal angular correlations between charged hadrons and energy
deposited in calorimeter towers in central $d$$+$Au and minimum bias $p$$+$$p$
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The charged hadron is measured at
midrapidity $|\eta|<0.35$, and the energy is measured at large rapidity
($-3.7<\eta<-3.1$, Au-going direction). An enhanced near-side angular
correlation across $|\Delta\eta| >$ 2.75 is observed in $d$$+$Au collisions.
Using the event plane method applied to the Au-going energy distribution, we
extract the anisotropy strength $v_2$ for inclusive charged hadrons at
midrapidity up to $p_T=4.5$ GeV/$c$. We also present the measurement of $v_2$
for identified $\pi^{\pm}$ and (anti)protons in central $d$$+$Au collisions,
and observe a mass-ordering pattern similar to that seen in heavy ion
collisions. These results are compared with viscous hydrodynamic calculations
and measurements from $p$$+$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The magnitude of
the mass-ordering in $d$$+$Au is found to be smaller than that in $p$$+$Pb
collisions, which may indicate smaller radial flow in lower energy $d$$+$Au
collisions.


The Eighth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First Data from
  SDSS-III

  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in August 2008, with
new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure and chemical
evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering of
galaxies and the quasar Ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search for
planets around ~8000 stars. This paper describes the first data release of
SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release
includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the Southern Galactic Cap,
bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over a
third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with
an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric
recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data
from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and
Evolution (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars
at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million
stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed
through an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determination
of metallicity for high metallicity stars.


SDSS-III: Massive Spectroscopic Surveys of the Distant Universe, the
  Milky Way Galaxy, and Extra-Solar Planetary Systems

  Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and II),
SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:
dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the Milky
Way, and the population of giant planets around other stars. In keeping with
SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data,
beginning with SDSS DR8 (which occurred in Jan 2011). This paper presents an
overview of the four SDSS-III surveys. BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.5
million massive galaxies and Lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the
BAO feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of
the distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z<0.7 and at z~2.5. SEGUE-2,
which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (R=1800) optical spectra of
118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,
stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter
halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE will obtain
high-resolution (R~30,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N>100 per resolution
element), H-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,
measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the first
high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge,
bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral
diagnostics. MARVELS will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 FGK stars
with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed to
detect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedented
data set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giant
planet systems. (Abridged)


Observation of the rare $B^0_s\toμ^+μ^-$ decay from the combined
  analysis of CMS and LHCb data

  A joint measurement is presented of the branching fractions
$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ in proton-proton collisions at the
LHC by the CMS and LHCb experiments. The data samples were collected in 2011 at
a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and in 2012 at 8 TeV. The combined analysis
produces the first observation of the $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, with a
statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best
measurement of its branching fraction so far. Furthermore, evidence for the
$B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay is obtained with a statistical significance of three
standard deviations. The branching fraction measurements are statistically
compatible with SM predictions and impose stringent constraints on several
theories beyond the SM.
