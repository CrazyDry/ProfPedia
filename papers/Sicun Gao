Quantifier Elimination over Finite Fields Using Gr√∂bner Bases

  We give an algebraic quantifier elimination algorithm for the first-ordertheory over any given finite field using Gr\"obner basis methods. The algorithmrelies on the strong Nullstellensatz and properties of elimination ideals overfinite fields. We analyze the theoretical complexity of the algorithm and showits application in the formal analysis of a biological controller model.

Delta-Decidability over the Reals

  Given any collection F of computable functions over the reals, we show thatthere exists an algorithm that, given any L_F-sentence \varphi containing onlybounded quantifiers, and any positive rational number \delta, decides either"\varphi is true", or "a \delta-strengthening of \varphi is false". Under mildassumptions, for a C-computable signature F, the \delta-decision problem forbounded \Sigma_k-sentences in L_F resides in (\Sigma_k^P)^C. The results standin sharp contrast to the well-known undecidability results, and serve as atheoretical basis for the use of numerical methods in decision procedures fornonlinear first-order theories over the reals.

Satisfiability Modulo ODEs

  We study SMT problems over the reals containing ordinary differentialequations. They are important for formal verification of realistic hybridsystems and embedded software. We develop delta-complete algorithms for SMTformulas that are purely existentially quantified, as well as exists-forallformulas whose universal quantification is restricted to the time variables. Wedemonstrate scalability of the algorithms, as implemented in our open-sourcesolver dReal, on SMT benchmarks with several hundred nonlinear ODEs andvariables.

Delta-Complete Analysis for Bounded Reachability of Hybrid Systems

  We present the framework of delta-complete analysis for bounded reachabilityproblems of general hybrid systems. We perform bounded reachability checkingthrough solving delta-decision problems over the reals. The techniques takeinto account of robustness properties of the systems under numericalperturbations. We prove that the verification problems become much moremathematically tractable in this new framework. Our implementation of thetechniques, an open-source tool dReach, scales well on several highly nonlinearhybrid system models that arise in biomedical and robotics applications.

Proof Generation from Delta-Decisions

  We show how to generate and validate logical proofs of unsatisfiability fromdelta-complete decision procedures that rely on error-prone numericalalgorithms. Solving this problem is important for ensuring correctness of thedecision procedures. At the same time, it is a new approach for automatedtheorem proving over real numbers. We design a first-order calculus, andtransform the computational steps of constraint solving into logic proofs,which are then validated using proof-checking algorithms. As an application, wedemonstrate how proofs generated from our solver can establish many nonlinearlemmas in the the formal proof of the Kepler Conjecture.

Revisiting the Complexity of Stability of Continuous and Hybrid Systems

  We develop a framework to give upper bounds on the "practical" computationalcomplexity of stability problems for a wide range of nonlinear continuous andhybrid systems. To do so, we describe stability properties of dynamical systemsusing first-order formulas over the real numbers, and reduce stability problemsto the delta-decision problems of these formulas. The framework allows us toobtain a precise characterization of the complexity of different notions ofstability for nonlinear continuous and hybrid systems. We prove that boundedversions of the stability problems are generally decidable, and give upperbounds on their complexity. The unbounded versions are generally undecidable,for which we give upper bounds on their degrees of unsolvability.

Descriptive Control Theory: A Proposal

  Logic is playing an increasingly important role in the engineering ofreal-time, hybrid, and cyber-physical systems, but mostly in the form ofposterior verification and high-level analysis. The core methodology in thedesign of real-world systems consists mainly of control theory and numericalanalysis, and has remained mostly free of logic and formal approaches. As aresult, besides facing extreme difficulty in guaranteeing the reliability ofthese systems, engineers are also missing out the computational power oflogic-based methods that has greatly advanced in the past decades. To changethis situation, we need a logical and computational foundation for controltheory. The name "descriptive control theory" emphasizes the overarching themeof using logic to express, analyze, and solve problems in control theory. Ifthe program is successfully carried out, logical approaches will significantlyextend existing engineering methods towards a unified methodology for handlingnonlinear and hybrid systems, and bring design automation and reliability to anunprecedented level in the broad field of engineering.

REAS: Combining Numerical Optimization with SAT Solving

  In this paper, we present ReaS, a technique that combines numericaloptimization with SAT solving to synthesize unknowns in a program that involvesdiscrete and floating point computation. ReaS makes the program end-to-enddifferentiable by smoothing any Boolean expression that introducesdiscontinuity such as conditionals and relaxing the Boolean unknowns so thatnumerical optimization can be performed. On top of this, ReaS uses a SAT solverto help the numerical search overcome local solutions by incrementally fixingvalues to the Boolean expressions. We evaluated the approach on 5 case studiesinvolving hybrid systems and show that ReaS can synthesize programs that couldnot be solved by previous SMT approaches.

Delta-Decision Procedures for Exists-Forall Problems over the Reals

  Solving nonlinear SMT problems over real numbers has wide applications inrobotics and AI. While significant progress is made in solving quantifier-freeSMT formulas in the domain, quantified formulas have been much lessinvestigated. We propose the first delta-complete algorithm for solvingsatisfiability of nonlinear SMT over real numbers with universal quantificationand a wide range of nonlinear functions. Our methods combine ideas fromcounterexample-guided synthesis, interval constraint propagation, and localoptimization. In particular, we show how special care is required in handlingthe interleaving of numerical and symbolic reasoning to ensuredelta-completeness. In experiments, we show that the proposed algorithms canhandle many new problems beyond the reach of existing SMT solvers.

Delta-Complete Decision Procedures for Satisfiability over the Reals

  We introduce the notion of "\delta-complete decision procedures" for solvingSMT problems over the real numbers, with the aim of handling a wide range ofnonlinear functions including transcendental functions and solutions ofLipschitz-continuous ODEs. Given an SMT problem \varphi and a positive rationalnumber \delta, a \delta-complete decision procedure determines either that\varphi is unsatisfiable, or that the "\delta-weakening" of \varphi issatisfiable. Here, the \delta-weakening of \varphi is a variant of \varphi thatallows \delta-bounded numerical perturbations on \varphi. We prove theexistence of \delta-complete decision procedures for bounded SMT over realswith functions mentioned above. For functions in Type 2 complexity class C,under mild assumptions, the bounded \delta-SMT problem is in NP^C.\delta-Complete decision procedures can exploit scalable numerical methods forhandling nonlinearity, and we propose to use this notion as an idealrequirement for numerically-driven decision procedures. As a concrete example,we formally analyze the DPLL<ICP> framework, which integrates IntervalConstraint Propagation (ICP) in DPLL(T), and establish necessary and sufficientconditions for its \delta-completeness. We discuss practical applications of\delta-complete decision procedures for correctness-critical applicationsincluding formal verification and theorem proving.

Parameter Synthesis for Cardiac Cell Hybrid Models Using Delta-Decisions

  A central problem in systems biology is to identify parameter values suchthat a biological model satisfies some behavioral constraints (\eg, timeseries). In this paper we focus on parameter synthesis for hybrid(continuous/discrete) models, as many biological systems can possess multipleoperational modes with specific continuous dynamics in each mode. Thesebiological systems are naturally modeled as hybrid automata, most often withnonlinear continuous dynamics. However, hybrid automata are notoriously hard toanalyze --- even simple reachability for hybrid systems with lineardifferential dynamics is an undecidable problem. In this paper we present aparameter synthesis framework based on $\delta$-complete decision proceduresthat sidesteps undecidability. We demonstrate our method on two highlynonlinear hybrid models of the cardiac cell action potential. The results showthat our parameter synthesis framework is convenient and efficient, and itenabled us to select a suitable model to study and identify crucial parameterranges related to cardiac disorders.

Towards Personalized Prostate Cancer Therapy Using Delta-Reachability  Analysis

  Recent clinical studies suggest that the efficacy of hormone therapy forprostate cancer depends on the characteristics of individual patients. In thispaper, we develop a computational framework for identifying patient-specificandrogen ablation therapy schedules for postponing the potential cancerrelapse. We model the population dynamics of heterogeneous prostate cancercells in response to androgen suppression as a nonlinear hybrid automaton. Weestimate personalized kinetic parameters to characterize patients and employ$\delta$-reachability analysis to predict patient-specific therapeuticstrategies. The results show that our methods are promising and may lead to aprognostic tool for personalized cancer therapy.

Tight Continuous-Time Reachtubes for Lagrangian Reachability

  We introduce continuous Lagrangian reachability (CLRT), a new algorithm forthe computation of a tight and continuous-time reachtube for the solution flowsof a nonlinear, time-variant dynamical system. CLRT employs finite straintheory to determine the deformation of the solution set from time $t_i$ to time$t_{i+1}$. We have developed simple explicit analytic formulas for the optimalmetric for this deformation; this is superior to prior work, which usedsemi-definite programming. CLRT also uses infinitesimal strain theory to derivean optimal time increment $h_i$ between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$, nonlinearoptimization to minimally bloat (i.e., using a minimal radius) the state set attime $t_i$ such that it includes all the states of the solution flow in theinterval $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$. We use $\delta$-satisfiability to ensure thecorrectness of the bloating. Our results on a series of benchmarks show thatCLRT performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art tools such as CAPD interms of the continuous reachtube volumes they compute.

SReach: A Bounded Model Checker for Stochastic Hybrid Systems

  In this paper we describe a new tool, SReach, which solves probabilisticbounded reachability problems for two classes of stochastic hybrid systems. Thefirst one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. Thesecond one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness for bothtransition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches toreachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions forlarge optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving bothnonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. Our approach encodesstochastic information by using random variables, and combines the randomizedsampling, a $\delta$-complete decision procedure, and statistical tests. SReachutilizes the $\delta$-complete decision procedure to solve reachabilityproblems in a sound manner, i.e., it always decides correctly if, for a givenassignment to all random variables, the system actually reaches the unsaferegion. The statistical tests adapted guarantee arbitrary small error boundsbetween probabilities estimated by SReach and real ones. Compared to standardsimulation-based methods, our approach supports non-deterministic branching,increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the zero-crossing problem. Wedemonstrate our method's feasibility by applying SReach to three representativebiological models and to additional benchmarks for nonlinear hybrid systemswith multiple probabilistic system parameters.

How to pick the domain randomization parameters for sim-to-real transfer  of reinforcement learning policies?

  Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have demonstrated remarkablesuccess in learning complicated behaviors from minimally processed input.However, most of this success is limited to simulation. While there arepromising successes in applying RL algorithms directly on real systems, theirperformance on more complex systems remains bottle-necked by the relative datainefficiency of RL algorithms. Domain randomization is a promising direction ofresearch that has demonstrated impressive results using RL algorithms tocontrol real robots. At a high level, domain randomization works by training apolicy on a distribution of environmental conditions in simulation. If theenvironments are diverse enough, then the policy trained on this distributionwill plausibly generalize to the real world. A human-specified design choice indomain randomization is the form and parameters of the distribution ofsimulated environments. It is unclear how to the best pick the form andparameters of this distribution and prior work uses hand-tuned distributions.This extended abstract demonstrates that the choice of the distribution plays amajor role in the performance of the trained policies in the real world andthat the parameter of this distribution can be optimized to maximize theperformance of the trained policies in the real world
