Towards Verified Artificial Intelligence

  Verified artificial intelligence (AI) is the goal of designing AI-based
systems that are provably correct with respect to mathematically-specified
requirements. This paper considers Verified AI from a formal methods
perspective. We describe five challenges for achieving Verified AI, and five
corresponding principles for addressing these challenges.


Mean-square boundedness of stochastic networked control systems with
  bounded control inputs

  We consider the problem of controlling marginally stable linear systems using
bounded control inputs for networked control settings in which the
communication channel between the remote controller and the system is
unreliable. We assume that the states are perfectly observed, but the control
inputs are transmitted over a noisy communication channel. Under mild
hypotheses on the noise introduced by the control communication channel and
large enough control authority, we construct a control policy that renders the
state of the closed-loop system mean-square bounded.


Metrization and Simulation of Controlled Hybrid Systems

  The study of controlled hybrid systems requires practical tools for
approximation and comparison of system behaviors. Existing approaches to these
problems impose undue restrictions on the system's continuous and discrete
dynamics. Metrization and simulation of controlled hybrid systems is considered
here in a unified framework by constructing a state space metric. The metric is
applied to develop a numerical simulation algorithm that converges uniformly,
with a known rate of convergence, to orbitally stable executions of controlled
hybrid systems, up to and including Zeno events. Benchmark hybrid phenomena
illustrate the utility of the proposed tools.


Nonlinear Basis Pursuit

  In compressive sensing, the basis pursuit algorithm aims to find the sparsest
solution to an underdetermined linear equation system. In this paper, we
generalize basis pursuit to finding the sparsest solution to higher order
nonlinear systems of equations, called nonlinear basis pursuit. In contrast to
the existing nonlinear compressive sensing methods, the new algorithm that
solves the nonlinear basis pursuit problem is convex and not greedy. The novel
algorithm enables the compressive sensing approach to be used for a broader
range of applications where there are nonlinear relationships between the
measurements and the unknowns.


Fundamental Limits of Nonintrusive Load Monitoring

  Provided an arbitrary nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) algorithm, we seek
bounds on the probability of distinguishing between scenarios, given an
aggregate power consumption signal. We introduce a framework for studying a
general NILM algorithm, and analyze the theory in the general case. Then, we
specialize to the case where the error is Gaussian. In both cases, we are able
to derive upper bounds on the probability of distinguishing scenarios. Finally,
we apply the results to real data to derive bounds on the probability of
distinguishing between scenarios as a function of the measurement noise, the
sampling rate, and the device usage.


Energy Disaggregation via Adaptive Filtering

  The energy disaggregation problem is recovering device level power
consumption signals from the aggregate power consumption signal for a building.
We show in this paper how the disaggregation problem can be reformulated as an
adaptive filtering problem. This gives both a novel disaggregation algorithm
and a better theoretical understanding for disaggregation. In particular, we
show how the disaggregation problem can be solved online using a filter bank
and discuss its optimality.


Experimental Design for Human-in-the-Loop Driving Simulations

  This report describes a new experimental setup for human-in-the-loop
simulations. A force feedback simulator with four axis motion has been setup
for real-time driving experiments. The simulator will move to simulate the
forces a driver feels while driving, which allows for a realistic experience
for the driver. This setup allows for flexibility and control for the
researcher in a realistic simulation environment. Experiments concerning driver
distraction can also be carried out safely in this test bed, in addition to
multi-agent experiments. All necessary code to run the simulator, the
additional sensors, and the basic processing is available for use.


Incentive Design and Utility Learning via Energy Disaggregation

  The utility company has many motivations for modifying energy consumption
patterns of consumers such as revenue decoupling and demand response programs.
We model the utility company--consumer interaction as a principal--agent
problem. We present an iterative algorithm for designing incentives while
estimating the consumer's utility function. Incentives are designed using the
aggregated as well as the disaggregated (device level) consumption data. We
simulate the iterative control (incentive design) and estimation (utility
learning and disaggregation) process for examples including the design of
incentives based on the aggregate consumption data as well as the disaggregated
consumption data.


Blind Identification via Lifting

  Blind system identification is known to be an ill-posed problem and without
further assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In this contribution, we
are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from only output
measurements. We phrase this as a constrained rank minimization problem and
present a relaxed convex formulation to approximate its solution. To make the
problem well posed we assume that the sought input lies in some known linear
subspace.


On the Characterization of Local Nash Equilibria in Continuous Games

  We present a unified framework for characterizing local Nash equilibria in
continuous games on either infinite-dimensional or finite-dimensional
non-convex strategy spaces. We provide intrinsic necessary and sufficient
first- and second-order conditions ensuring strategies constitute local Nash
equilibria. We term points satisfying the sufficient conditions differential
Nash equilibria. Further, we provide a sufficient condition (non-degeneracy)
guaranteeing differential Nash equilibria are isolated and show that such
equilibria are structurally stable. We present tutorial examples to illustrate
our results and highlight degeneracies that can arise in continuous games.


On the Relaxation of Hybrid Dynamical Systems

  Hybrid dynamical systems have proven to be a powerful modeling abstraction,
yet fundamental questions regarding the dynamical properties of these systems
remain. In this paper, we develop a novel class of relaxations which we use to
recover a number of classic systems theoretic properties for hybrid systems,
such as existence and uniqueness of trajectories, even past the point of Zeno.
Our relaxations also naturally give rise to a class of provably convergent
numerical approximations, capable of simulating through Zeno. Using our
methods, we are also able to perform sensitivity analysis about nominal
trajectories undergoing a discrete transition -- a technique with many
practical applications, such as assessing the stability of periodic orbits.


Modified Newton's rings: II

  In an earlier work (Shankar kumar Jha, A Vyas, O S K S Sastri, Rajkumar Jain
& K S Umesh, 'Determination of wavelength of laser light using Modified
Newton's rings setup', Physics Education, vol. 22, no.3, 195-202(2005))
reported by our group, a version of Newton's rings experiment called Modified
Newton's rings was proposed. The present work is an extension of this work.
Here, a general formula for wavelength has been derived, applicable for a plane
of observation at any distance. A relation between the focal length and the
radius curvature is also derived for a plano-convex lens which is essentially
used as a concave mirror. Tracker, a video analysis software, freely
downloadable from the net, is employed to analyze the fringes captured using a
CCD camera. Two beams which give rise to interference fringes in conventional
Newton's rings and in the present setup are clearly distinguished.


Segmentation of Natural Images by Texture and Boundary Compression

  We present a novel algorithm for segmentation of natural images that
harnesses the principle of minimum description length (MDL). Our method is
based on observations that a homogeneously textured region of a natural image
can be well modeled by a Gaussian distribution and the region boundary can be
effectively coded by an adaptive chain code. The optimal segmentation of an
image is the one that gives the shortest coding length for encoding all
textures and boundaries in the image, and is obtained via an agglomerative
clustering process applied to a hierarchy of decreasing window sizes as
multi-scale texture features. The optimal segmentation also provides an
accurate estimate of the overall coding length and hence the true entropy of
the image. We test our algorithm on the publicly available Berkeley
Segmentation Dataset. It achieves state-of-the-art segmentation results
compared to other existing methods.


Goal Inference Improves Objective and Perceived Performance in
  Human-Robot Collaboration

  The study of human-robot interaction is fundamental to the design and use of
robotics in real-world applications. Robots will need to predict and adapt to
the actions of human collaborators in order to achieve good performance and
improve safety and end-user adoption. This paper evaluates a human-robot
collaboration scheme that combines the task allocation and motion levels of
reasoning: the robotic agent uses Bayesian inference to predict the next goal
of its human partner from his or her ongoing motion, and re-plans its own
actions in real time. This anticipative adaptation is desirable in many
practical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on the
cognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to the
robot. A behavioral experiment indicates that the combination of goal inference
and dynamic task planning significantly improves both objective and perceived
performance of the human-robot team. Participants were highly sensitive to the
differences between robot behaviors, preferring to work with a robot that
adapted to their actions over one that did not.


Generating Plans that Predict Themselves

  Collaboration requires coordination, and we coordinate by anticipating our
teammates' future actions and adapting to their plan. In some cases, our
teammates' actions early on can give us a clear idea of what the remainder of
their plan is, i.e. what action sequence we should expect. In others, they
might leave us less confident, or even lead us to the wrong conclusion. Our
goal is for robot actions to fall in the first category: we want to enable
robots to select their actions in such a way that human collaborators can
easily use them to correctly anticipate what will follow. While previous work
has focused on finding initial plans that convey a set goal, here we focus on
finding two portions of a plan such that the initial portion conveys the final
one. We introduce $t$-\ACty{}: a measure that quantifies the accuracy and
confidence with which human observers can predict the remaining robot plan from
the overall task goal and the observed initial $t$ actions in the plan. We
contribute a method for generating $t$-predictable plans: we search for a full
plan that accomplishes the task, but in which the first $t$ actions make it as
easy as possible to infer the remaining ones. The result is often different
from the most efficient plan, in which the initial actions might leave a lot of
ambiguity as to how the task will be completed. Through an online experiment
and an in-person user study with physical robots, we find that our approach
outperforms a traditional efficiency-based planner in objective and subjective
collaboration metrics.


A Learning Based Approach to Control Synthesis of Markov Decision
  Processes for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications

  We propose to synthesize a control policy for a Markov decision process (MDP)
such that the resulting traces of the MDP satisfy a linear temporal logic (LTL)
property. We construct a product MDP that incorporates a deterministic Rabin
automaton generated from the desired LTL property. The reward function of the
product MDP is defined from the acceptance condition of the Rabin automaton.
This construction allows us to apply techniques from learning theory to the
problem of synthesis for LTL specifications even when the transition
probabilities are not known a priori. We prove that our method is guaranteed to
find a controller that satisfies the LTL property with probability one if such
a policy exists, and we suggest empirically with a case study in traffic
control that our method produces reasonable control strategies even when the
LTL property cannot be satisfied with probability one.


On the Lagrangian Biduality of Sparsity Minimization Problems

  Recent results in Compressive Sensing have shown that, under certain
conditions, the solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations with
sparsity-based regularization can be accurately recovered by solving convex
relaxations of the original problem. In this work, we present a novel
primal-dual analysis on a class of sparsity minimization problems. We show that
the Lagrangian bidual (i.e., the Lagrangian dual of the Lagrangian dual) of the
sparsity minimization problems can be used to derive interesting convex
relaxations: the bidual of the $\ell_0$-minimization problem is the
$\ell_1$-minimization problem; and the bidual of the $\ell_{0,1}$-minimization
problem for enforcing group sparsity on structured data is the
$\ell_{1,\infty}$-minimization problem. The analysis provides a means to
compute per-instance non-trivial lower bounds on the (group) sparsity of the
desired solutions. In a real-world application, the bidual relaxation improves
the performance of a sparsity-based classification framework applied to robust
face recognition.


Compressive Shift Retrieval

  The classical shift retrieval problem considers two signals in vector form
that are related by a shift. The problem is of great importance in many
applications and is typically solved by maximizing the cross-correlation
between the two signals. Inspired by compressive sensing, in this paper, we
seek to estimate the shift directly from compressed signals. We show that under
certain conditions, the shift can be recovered using fewer samples and less
computation compared to the classical setup. Of particular interest is shift
estimation from Fourier coefficients. We show that under rather mild conditions
only one Fourier coefficient suffices to recover the true shift.


Blind Identification of ARX Models with Piecewise Constant Inputs

  Blind system identification is known to be a hard ill-posed problem and
without further assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In this
contribution, we are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from
only output measurements. Driven by the task of identifying systems that are
turned on and off at unknown times, we seek a piecewise constant input and a
corresponding ARX model which approximates the measured outputs. We phrase this
as a rank minimization problem and present a relaxed convex formulation to
approximate its solution. The proposed method was developed to model power
consumption of electrical appliances and is now a part of a bigger energy
disaggregation framework. Code will be made available online.


A Dynamical Systems Approach to Energy Disaggregation

  Energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is
the task of separating aggregate energy data for a whole building into the
energy data for individual appliances. Studies have shown that simply providing
disaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior.
However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presently
a practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providing
energy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existing
infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform the
energy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input,
single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device and
the input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregation
translates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observed
power consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and show
its results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.


Model Reduction Near Periodic Orbits of Hybrid Dynamical Systems

  We show that, near periodic orbits, a class of hybrid models can be reduced
to or approximated by smooth continuous-time dynamical systems. Specifically,
near an exponentially stable periodic orbit undergoing isolated transitions in
a hybrid dynamical system, nearby executions generically contract
superexponentially to a constant-dimensional subsystem. Under a non-degeneracy
condition on the rank deficiency of the associated Poincare map, the
contraction occurs in finite time regardless of the stability properties of the
orbit. Hybrid transitions may be removed from the resulting subsystem via a
topological quotient that admits a smooth structure to yield an equivalent
smooth dynamical system. We demonstrate reduction of a high-dimensional
underactuated mechanical model for terrestrial locomotion, assess structural
stability of deadbeat controllers for rhythmic locomotion and manipulation, and
derive a normal form for the stability basin of a hybrid oscillator. These
applications illustrate the utility of our theoretical results for synthesis
and analysis of feedback control laws for rhythmic hybrid behavior.


Statistical Results on Filtering and Epi-convergence for Learning-Based
  Model Predictive Control

  Learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) is a technique that provides
deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools
are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve
performance. This technical note provides proofs that elucidate the reasons for
our choice of measurement model, as well as giving proofs concerning the
stochastic convergence of LBMPC. The first part of this note discusses
simultaneous state estimation and statistical identification (or learning) of
unmodeled dynamics, for dynamical systems that can be described by ordinary
differential equations (ODE's). The second part provides proofs concerning the
epi-convergence of different statistical estimators that can be used with the
learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) technique. In particular, we
prove results on the statistical properties of a nonparametric estimator that
we have designed to have the correct deterministic and stochastic properties
for numerical implementation when used in conjunction with LBMPC.


Quadratic Basis Pursuit

  In many compressive sensing problems today, the relationship between the
measurements and the unknowns could be nonlinear. Traditional treatment of such
nonlinear relationships have been to approximate the nonlinearity via a linear
model and the subsequent un-modeled dynamics as noise. The ability to more
accurately characterize nonlinear models has the potential to improve the
results in both existing compressive sensing applications and those where a
linear approximation does not suffice, e.g., phase retrieval. In this paper, we
extend the classical compressive sensing framework to a second-order Taylor
expansion of the nonlinearity. Using a lifting technique and a method we call
quadratic basis pursuit, we show that the sparse signal can be recovered
exactly when the sampling rate is sufficiently high. We further present
efficient numerical algorithms to recover sparse signals in second-order
nonlinear systems, which are considerably more difficult to solve than their
linear counterparts in sparse optimization.


Privacy and Customer Segmentation in the Smart Grid

  In the electricity grid, networked sensors which record and transmit
increasingly high-granularity data are being deployed. In such a setting,
privacy concerns are a natural consideration. We present an attack model for
privacy breaches, and, using results from estimation theory, derive theoretical
results ensuring that an adversary will fail to infer private information with
a certain probability, independent of the algorithm used. We show utility
companies would benefit from less noisy, higher frequency data, as it would
improve various smart grid operations such as load prediction. We provide a
method to quantify how smart grid operations improve as a function of higher
frequency data. In order to obtain the consumer's valuation of privacy, we
design a screening mechanism consisting of a menu of contracts to the energy
consumer with varying guarantees of privacy. The screening process is a means
to segment customers. Finally, we design insurance contracts using the
probability of a privacy breach to be offered by third-party insurance
companies.


Rapid Integration and Calibration of New Sensors Using the Berkeley
  Aachen Robotics Toolkit (BART)

  After the three DARPA Grand Challenge contests many groups around the world
have continued to actively research and work toward an autonomous vehicle
capable of accomplishing a mission in a given context (e.g. desert, city) while
following a set of prescribed rules, but none has been completely successful in
uncontrolled environments, a task that many people trivially fulfill every day.
We believe that, together with improving the sensors used in cars and the
artificial intelligence algorithms used to process the information, the
community should focus on the systems engineering aspects of the problem, i.e.
the limitations of the car (in terms of space, power, or heat dissipation) and
the limitations of the software development cycle. This paper explores these
issues and our experiences overcoming them.


Effects of Risk on Privacy Contracts for Demand-Side Management

  As smart meters continue to be deployed around the world collecting
unprecedented levels of fine-grained data about consumers, we need to find
mechanisms that are fair to both, (1) the electric utility who needs the data
to improve their operations, and (2) the consumer who has a valuation of
privacy but at the same time benefits from sharing consumption data. In this
paper we address this problem by proposing privacy contracts between electric
utilities and consumers with the goal of maximizing the social welfare of both.
Our mathematical model designs an optimization problem between a population of
users that have different valuations on privacy and the costs of operation by
the utility. We then show how contracts can change depending on the probability
of a privacy breach. This line of research can help inform not only current but
also future smart meter collection practices.


Quantifying the Utility-Privacy Tradeoff in the Smart Grid

  The modernization of the electrical grid and the installation of smart meters
come with many advantages to control and monitoring. However, in the wrong
hands, the data might pose a privacy threat. In this paper, we consider the
tradeoff between smart grid operations and the privacy of consumers. We analyze
the tradeoff between smart grid operations and how often data is collected by
considering a realistic direct-load control example using thermostatically
controlled loads, and we give simulation results to show how its performance
degrades as the sampling frequency decreases. Additionally, we introduce a new
privacy metric, which we call inferential privacy. This privacy metric assumes
a strong adversary model, and provides an upper bound on the adversary's
ability to infer a private parameter, independent of the algorithm he uses.
Combining these two results allow us to directly consider the tradeoff between
better load control and consumer privacy.


Diagnosis and Repair for Synthesis from Signal Temporal Logic
  Specifications

  We address the problem of diagnosing and repairing specifications for hybrid
systems formalized in signal temporal logic (STL). Our focus is on the setting
of automatic synthesis of controllers in a model predictive control (MPC)
framework. We build on recent approaches that reduce the controller synthesis
problem to solving one or more mixed integer linear programs (MILPs), where
infeasibility of a MILP usually indicates unrealizability of the controller
synthesis problem. Given an infeasible STL synthesis problem, we present
algorithms that provide feedback on the reasons for unrealizability, and
suggestions for making it realizable. Our algorithms are sound and complete,
i.e., they provide a correct diagnosis, and always terminate with a non-trivial
specification that is feasible using the chosen synthesis method, when such a
solution exists. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
synthesis of controllers for various cyber-physical systems, including an
autonomous driving application and an aircraft electric power system.


Dimension Reduction Near Periodic Orbits of Hybrid Systems

  When the Poincar\'{e} map associated with a periodic orbit of a hybrid
dynamical system has constant-rank iterates, we demonstrate the existence of a
constant-dimensional invariant subsystem near the orbit which attracts all
nearby trajectories in finite time. This result shows that the long-term
behavior of a hybrid model with a large number of degrees-of-freedom may be
governed by a low-dimensional smooth dynamical system. The appearance of such
simplified models enables the translation of analytical tools from smooth
systems-such as Floquet theory-to the hybrid setting and provides a bridge
between the efforts of biologists and engineers studying legged locomotion.


Differential Privacy of Populations in Routing Games

  As our ground transportation infrastructure modernizes, the large amount of
data being measured, transmitted, and stored motivates an analysis of the
privacy aspect of these emerging cyber-physical technologies. In this paper, we
consider privacy in the routing game, where the origins and destinations of
drivers are considered private. This is motivated by the fact that this
spatiotemporal information can easily be used as the basis for inferences for a
person's activities. More specifically, we consider the differential privacy of
the mapping from the amount of flow for each origin-destination pair to the
traffic flow measurements on each link of a traffic network. We use a
stochastic online learning framework for the population dynamics, which is
known to converge to the Nash equilibrium of the routing game. We analyze the
sensitivity of this process and provide theoretical guarantees on the
convergence rates as well as differential privacy values for these models. We
confirm these with simulations on a small example.


Statistical Estimation with Strategic Data Sources in Competitive
  Settings

  In this paper, we introduce a preliminary model for interactions in the data
market. Recent research has shown ways in which a data aggregator can design
mechanisms for users to ensure the quality of data, even in situations where
the users are effort-averse (i.e. prefer to submit lower-quality estimates) and
the data aggregator cannot observe the effort exerted by the users (i.e. the
contract suffers from the principal-agent problem). However, we have shown that
these mechanisms often break down in more realistic models, where multiple data
aggregators are in competition. Under minor assumptions on the properties of
the statistical estimators in use by data aggregators, we show that there is
either no Nash equilibrium, or there is an infinite number of Nash equilibrium.
In the latter case, there is a fundamental ambiguity in who bears the burden of
incentivizing different data sources. We are also able to calculate the price
of anarchy, which measures how much social welfare is lost between the Nash
equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e. between non-cooperative strategic play
and cooperation.


A Robust Utility Learning Framework via Inverse Optimization

  In many smart infrastructure applications flexibility in achieving
sustainability goals can be gained by engaging end-users. However, these users
often have heterogeneous preferences that are unknown to the decision-maker
tasked with improving operational efficiency. Modeling user interaction as a
continuous game between non-cooperative players, we propose a robust parametric
utility learning framework that employs constrained feasible generalized least
squares estimation with heteroskedastic inference. To improve forecasting
performance, we extend the robust utility learning scheme by employing
bootstrapping with bagging, bumping, and gradient boosting ensemble methods.
Moreover, we estimate the noise covariance which provides approximated
correlations between players which we leverage to develop a novel correlated
utility learning framework. We apply the proposed methods both to a toy example
arising from Bertrand-Nash competition between two firms as well as to data
from a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavior
amongst smart building occupants. Using occupant voting data for shared
resources such as lighting, we simulate the game defined by the estimated
utility functions to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.


Scalable Anomaly Detection in Large Homogenous Populations

  Anomaly detection in large populations is a challenging but highly relevant
problem. The problem is essentially a multi-hypothesis problem, with a
hypothesis for every division of the systems into normal and anomal systems.
The number of hypothesis grows rapidly with the number of systems and
approximate solutions become a necessity for any problems of practical
interests. In the current paper we take an optimization approach to this
multi-hypothesis problem. We first observe that the problem is equivalent to a
non-convex combinatorial optimization problem. We then relax the problem to a
convex problem that can be solved distributively on the systems and that stays
computationally tractable as the number of systems increase. An interesting
property of the proposed method is that it can under certain conditions be
shown to give exactly the same result as the combinatorial multi-hypothesis
problem and the relaxation is hence tight.


Nonlinear Compressive Particle Filtering

  Many systems for which compressive sensing is used today are dynamical. The
common approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence of
independent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, the
temporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the
state estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support
could be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the
linear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the
Kalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case,
compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the
particle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the most
novel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, with
the particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and that
neither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives a
satisfying solution.


Robust Subspace System Identification via Weighted Nuclear Norm
  Optimization

  Subspace identification is a classical and very well studied problem in
system identification. The problem was recently posed as a convex optimization
problem via the nuclear norm relaxation. Inspired by robust PCA, we extend this
framework to handle outliers. The proposed framework takes the form of a convex
optimization problem with an objective that trades off fit, rank and sparsity.
As in robust PCA, it can be problematic to find a suitable regularization
parameter. We show how the space in which a suitable parameter should be sought
can be limited to a bounded open set of the two dimensional parameter space. In
practice, this is very useful since it restricts the parameter space that is
needed to be surveyed.


Social Game for Building Energy Efficiency: Utility Learning,
  Simulation, and Analysis

  We describe a social game that we designed for encouraging energy efficient
behavior amongst building occupants with the aim of reducing overall energy
consumption in the building. Occupants vote for their desired lighting level
and win points which are used in a lottery based on how far their vote is from
the maximum setting. We assume that the occupants are utility maximizers and
that their utility functions capture the tradeoff between winning points and
their comfort level. We model the occupants as non-cooperative agents in a
continuous game and we characterize their play using the Nash equilibrium
concept. Using occupant voting data, we parameterize their utility functions
and use a convex optimization problem to estimate the parameters. We simulate
the game defined by the estimated utility functions and show that the estimated
model for occupant behavior is a good predictor of their actual behavior. In
addition, we show that due to the social game, there is a significant reduction
in energy consumption.


Privacy-Enhanced Architecture for Occupancy-based HVAC Control

  Large-scale sensing and actuation infrastructures have allowed buildings to
achieve significant energy savings; at the same time, these technologies
introduce significant privacy risks that must be addressed. In this paper, we
present a framework for modeling the trade-off between improved control
performance and increased privacy risks due to occupancy sensing. More
specifically, we consider occupancy-based HVAC control as the control objective
and the location traces of individual occupants as the private variables.
Previous studies have shown that individual location information can be
inferred from occupancy measurements. To ensure privacy, we design an
architecture that distorts the occupancy data in order to hide individual
occupant location information while maintaining HVAC performance. Using mutual
information between the individual's location trace and the reported occupancy
measurement as a privacy metric, we are able to optimally design a scheme to
minimize privacy risk subject to a control performance guarantee. We evaluate
our framework using real-world occupancy data: first, we verify that our
privacy metric accurately assesses the adversary's ability to infer private
variables from the distorted sensor measurements; then, we show that control
performance is maintained through simulations of building operations using
these distorted occupancy readings.


Optimal Causal Imputation for Control

  The widespread applicability of analytics in cyber-physical systems has
motivated research into causal inference methods. Predictive estimators are not
sufficient when analytics are used for decision making; rather, the flow of
causal effects must be determined. Generally speaking, these methods focus on
estimation of a causal structure from experimental data. In this paper, we
consider the dual problem: we fix the causal structure and optimize over causal
imputations to achieve desirable system behaviors for a minimal imputation
cost. First, we present the optimal causal imputation problem, and then we
analyze the problem in two special cases: 1) when the causal imputations can
only impute to a fixed value, 2) when the causal structure has linear dynamics
with additive Gaussian noise. This optimal causal imputation framework serves
to bridge the gap between causal structures and control.


A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach for Online Expert Selection in Markov
  Decision Processes

  We formulate a multi-armed bandit (MAB) approach to choosing expert policies
online in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Given a set of expert policies
trained on a state and action space, the goal is to maximize the cumulative
reward of our agent. The hope is to quickly find the best expert in our set.
The MAB formulation allows us to quantify the performance of an algorithm in
terms of the regret incurred from not choosing the best expert from the
beginning. We first develop the theoretical framework for MABs in MDPs, and
then present a basic regret decomposition identity. We then adapt the classical
Upper Confidence Bounds algorithm to the problem of choosing experts in MDPs
and prove that the expected regret grows at worst at a logarithmic rate.
Lastly, we validate the theory on a small MDP.


People as Sensors: Imputing Maps from Human Actions

  Despite growing attention in autonomy, there are still many open problems,
including how autonomous vehicles will interact and communicate with other
agents, such as human drivers and pedestrians. Unlike most approaches that
focus on pedestrian detection and planning for collision avoidance, this paper
considers modeling the interaction between human drivers and pedestrians and
how it might influence map estimation, as a proxy for detection. We take a
mapping inspired approach and incorporate people as sensors into mapping
frameworks. By taking advantage of other agents' actions, we demonstrate how we
can impute portions of the map that would otherwise be occluded. We evaluate
our framework in human driving experiments and on real-world data, using
occupancy grids and landmark-based mapping approaches. Our approach
significantly improves overall environment awareness and out-performs standard
mapping techniques.


A New Solution Concept and Family of Relaxations for Hybrid Dynamical
  Systems

  We introduce a holistic framework for the analysis, approximation and control
of the trajectories of hybrid dynamical systems which display event-triggered
discrete jumps in the continuous state. We begin by demonstrating how to
explicitly represent the dynamics of this class of systems using a single
piecewise-smooth vector field defined on a manifold, and then employ Filippov's
solution concept to describe the trajectories of the system. The resulting
\emph{hybrid Filippov solutions} greatly simplify the mathematical description
of hybrid executions, providing a unifying solution concept with which to work.
Extending previous efforts to regularize piecewise-smooth vector fields, we
then introduce a parameterized family of smooth control systems whose
trajectories are used to approximate the hybrid Filippov solution numerically.
The two solution concepts are shown to agree in the limit, under mild
regularity conditions.


Step Size Matters in Deep Learning

  Training a neural network with the gradient descent algorithm gives rise to a
discrete-time nonlinear dynamical system. Consequently, behaviors that are
typically observed in these systems emerge during training, such as convergence
to an orbit but not to a fixed point or dependence of convergence on the
initialization. Step size of the algorithm plays a critical role in these
behaviors: it determines the subset of the local optima that the algorithm can
converge to, and it specifies the magnitude of the oscillations if the
algorithm converges to an orbit. To elucidate the effects of the step size on
training of neural networks, we study the gradient descent algorithm as a
discrete-time dynamical system, and by analyzing the Lyapunov stability of
different solutions, we show the relationship between the step size of the
algorithm and the solutions that can be obtained with this algorithm. The
results provide an explanation for several phenomena observed in practice,
including the deterioration in the training error with increased depth, the

On Finding Local Nash Equilibria (and Only Local Nash Equilibria) in
  Zero-Sum Games

  We propose local symplectic surgery, a two-timescale procedure for finding
local Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. We first show that previous
gradient-based algorithms cannot guarantee convergence to local Nash equilibria
due to the existence of non-Nash stationary points. By taking advantage of the
differential structure of the game, we construct an algorithm for which the
local Nash equilibria are the only attracting fixed points. We also show that
the algorithm exhibits no oscillatory behaviors in neighborhoods of equilibria
and show that it has the same per-iteration complexity as other recently
proposed algorithms. We conclude by validating the algorithm on two numerical
examples: a toy example with multiple Nash equilibria and a non-Nash
equilibrium, and the training of a small generative adversarial network (GAN).


Technical Report: Optimal Control of Piecwise-smooth Control Systems via
  Singular Perturbations

  This paper investigates optimal control problems formulated over a class of
piecewise-smooth vector fields. Instead of optimizing over the discontinuous
system directly, we instead formulate optimal control problems over a family of
regularizations which are obtained by "smoothing out" the discontinuity in the
original system. It is shown that the smooth problems can be used to obtain
accurate derivative information about the non-smooth problem, under standard
regularity conditions. We then indicate how the regularizations can be used to
consistently approximate the non-smooth optimal control problem in the sense of
Polak. The utility of these smoothing techniques is demonstrated in an in-depth
example, where we utilize recently developed reduced-order modeling techniques
from the dynamic walking community to generate motion plans across contact
sequences for a 18-DOF model of a lower-body exoskeleton.


A low frequency radio telescope at Mauritius for a Southern sky survey

  A new, meter-wave radio telescope has been built in the North-East of
Mauritius, an island in the Indian ocean, at a latitude of -20.14 deg. The
Mauritius Radio Telescope (MRT) is a Fourier Synthesis T-shaped array,
consisting of a 2048 m long East-West arm and a 880 m long South arm. In the
East-West arm 1024 fixed helices are arranged in 32 groups and in the South arm
16 trolleys, with four helices on each, which move on a rail are used. A 512
channel digital complex correlation receiver is used to measure the visibility
function. At least 60 days of observing are required for obtaining the
visibilities up to 880 m spacing. The Fourier transform of the calibrated
visibilities produces a map of the area of the sky under observation with a
synthesized beam width 4'X 4.6'sec(dec+20.14) at 151.5 MHz.
  The primary objective of the telescope is to produce a sky survey in the
declination range -70 deg to -10 deg with a point source sensitivity of about
200 mJy (3-sigma level). This will be the southern sky equivalent of the
Cambridge 6C survey. In this paper we describe the telescope, discuss the array
design and the calibration techniques used, and present a map made using the
telescope.


Fast L1-Minimization Algorithms For Robust Face Recognition

  L1-minimization refers to finding the minimum L1-norm solution to an
underdetermined linear system b=Ax. Under certain conditions as described in
compressive sensing theory, the minimum L1-norm solution is also the sparsest
solution. In this paper, our study addresses the speed and scalability of its
algorithms. In particular, we focus on the numerical implementation of a
sparsity-based classification framework in robust face recognition, where
sparse representation is sought to recover human identities from very
high-dimensional facial images that may be corrupted by illumination, facial
disguise, and pose variation. Although the underlying numerical problem is a
linear program, traditional algorithms are known to suffer poor scalability for
large-scale applications. We investigate a new solution based on a classical
convex optimization framework, known as Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM). The
new convex solvers provide a viable solution to real-world, time-critical
applications such as face recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate and compare the performance of the ALM algorithms against several
popular L1-minimization solvers, including interior-point method, Homotopy,
FISTA, SESOP-PCD, approximate message passing (AMP) and TFOCS. To aid peer
evaluation, the code for all the algorithms has been made publicly available.


Provably Safe and Robust Learning-Based Model Predictive Control

  Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and
the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on
the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance
to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based
model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees
on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify
richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of
this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes
system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use
a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main
insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under
reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of
the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty,
and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves
performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned
dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same
inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty.
Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC
control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the
true dynamics.


Consistent Approximations for the Optimal Control of Constrained
  Switched Systems

  Though switched dynamical systems have shown great utility in modeling a
variety of physical phenomena, the construction of an optimal control of such
systems has proven difficult since it demands some type of optimal mode
scheduling. In this paper, we devise an algorithm for the computation of an
optimal control of constrained nonlinear switched dynamical systems. The
control parameter for such systems include a continuous-valued input and
discrete-valued input, where the latter corresponds to the mode of the switched
system that is active at a particular instance in time. Our approach, which we
prove converges to local minimizers of the constrained optimal control problem,
first relaxes the discrete-valued input, then performs traditional optimal
control, and then projects the constructed relaxed discrete-valued input back
to a pure discrete-valued input by employing an extension to the classical
Chattering Lemma that we prove. We extend this algorithm by formulating a
computationally implementable algorithm which works by discretizing the time
interval over which the switched dynamical system is defined. Importantly, we
prove that this implementable algorithm constructs a sequence of points by
recursive application that converge to the local minimizers of the original
constrained optimal control problem. Four simulation experiments are included
to validate the theoretical developments.


Approximation Algorithms for Optimization of Combinatorial Dynamical
  Systems

  This paper considers an optimization problem for a dynamical system whose
evolution depends on a collection of binary decision variables. We develop
scalable approximation algorithms with provable suboptimality bounds to provide
computationally tractable solution methods even when the dimension of the
system and the number of the binary variables are large. The proposed method
employs a linear approximation of the objective function such that the
approximate problem is defined over the feasible space of the binary decision
variables, which is a discrete set. To define such a linear approximation, we
propose two different variation methods: one uses continuous relaxation of the
discrete space and the other uses convex combinations of the vector field and
running payoff. The approximate problem is a 0-1 linear program, which can be
solved by existing polynomial-time exact or approximation algorithms, and does
not require the solution of the dynamical system. Furthermore, we characterize
a sufficient condition ensuring the approximate solution has a provable
suboptimality bound. We show that this condition can be interpreted as the
concavity of the objective function. The performance and utility of the
proposed algorithms are demonstrated with the ON/OFF control problems of
interdependent refrigeration systems.


Compressive Phase Retrieval From Squared Output Measurements Via
  Semidefinite Programming

  Given a linear system in a real or complex domain, linear regression aims to
recover the model parameters from a set of observations. Recent studies in
compressive sensing have successfully shown that under certain conditions, a
linear program, namely, l1-minimization, guarantees recovery of sparse
parameter signals even when the system is underdetermined. In this paper, we
consider a more challenging problem: when the phase of the output measurements
from a linear system is omitted. Using a lifting technique, we show that even
though the phase information is missing, the sparse signal can be recovered
exactly by solving a simple semidefinite program when the sampling rate is
sufficiently high, albeit the exact solutions to both sparse signal recovery
and phase retrieval are combinatorial. The results extend the type of
applications that compressive sensing can be applied to those where only output
magnitudes can be observed. We demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithms
through theoretical analysis, extensive simulations and a practical experiment.
