Towards Verified Artificial Intelligence

  Verified artificial intelligence (AI) is the goal of designing AI-basedsystems that are provably correct with respect to mathematically-specifiedrequirements. This paper considers Verified AI from a formal methodsperspective. We describe five challenges for achieving Verified AI, and fivecorresponding principles for addressing these challenges.

Mean-square boundedness of stochastic networked control systems with  bounded control inputs

  We consider the problem of controlling marginally stable linear systems usingbounded control inputs for networked control settings in which thecommunication channel between the remote controller and the system isunreliable. We assume that the states are perfectly observed, but the controlinputs are transmitted over a noisy communication channel. Under mildhypotheses on the noise introduced by the control communication channel andlarge enough control authority, we construct a control policy that renders thestate of the closed-loop system mean-square bounded.

Metrization and Simulation of Controlled Hybrid Systems

  The study of controlled hybrid systems requires practical tools forapproximation and comparison of system behaviors. Existing approaches to theseproblems impose undue restrictions on the system's continuous and discretedynamics. Metrization and simulation of controlled hybrid systems is consideredhere in a unified framework by constructing a state space metric. The metric isapplied to develop a numerical simulation algorithm that converges uniformly,with a known rate of convergence, to orbitally stable executions of controlledhybrid systems, up to and including Zeno events. Benchmark hybrid phenomenaillustrate the utility of the proposed tools.

Nonlinear Basis Pursuit

  In compressive sensing, the basis pursuit algorithm aims to find the sparsestsolution to an underdetermined linear equation system. In this paper, wegeneralize basis pursuit to finding the sparsest solution to higher ordernonlinear systems of equations, called nonlinear basis pursuit. In contrast tothe existing nonlinear compressive sensing methods, the new algorithm thatsolves the nonlinear basis pursuit problem is convex and not greedy. The novelalgorithm enables the compressive sensing approach to be used for a broaderrange of applications where there are nonlinear relationships between themeasurements and the unknowns.

Energy Disaggregation via Adaptive Filtering

  The energy disaggregation problem is recovering device level powerconsumption signals from the aggregate power consumption signal for a building.We show in this paper how the disaggregation problem can be reformulated as anadaptive filtering problem. This gives both a novel disaggregation algorithmand a better theoretical understanding for disaggregation. In particular, weshow how the disaggregation problem can be solved online using a filter bankand discuss its optimality.

Fundamental Limits of Nonintrusive Load Monitoring

  Provided an arbitrary nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) algorithm, we seekbounds on the probability of distinguishing between scenarios, given anaggregate power consumption signal. We introduce a framework for studying ageneral NILM algorithm, and analyze the theory in the general case. Then, wespecialize to the case where the error is Gaussian. In both cases, we are ableto derive upper bounds on the probability of distinguishing scenarios. Finally,we apply the results to real data to derive bounds on the probability ofdistinguishing between scenarios as a function of the measurement noise, thesampling rate, and the device usage.

Incentive Design and Utility Learning via Energy Disaggregation

  The utility company has many motivations for modifying energy consumptionpatterns of consumers such as revenue decoupling and demand response programs.We model the utility company--consumer interaction as a principal--agentproblem. We present an iterative algorithm for designing incentives whileestimating the consumer's utility function. Incentives are designed using theaggregated as well as the disaggregated (device level) consumption data. Wesimulate the iterative control (incentive design) and estimation (utilitylearning and disaggregation) process for examples including the design ofincentives based on the aggregate consumption data as well as the disaggregatedconsumption data.

Blind Identification via Lifting

  Blind system identification is known to be an ill-posed problem and withoutfurther assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In this contribution, weare concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from only outputmeasurements. We phrase this as a constrained rank minimization problem andpresent a relaxed convex formulation to approximate its solution. To make theproblem well posed we assume that the sought input lies in some known linearsubspace.

Experimental Design for Human-in-the-Loop Driving Simulations

  This report describes a new experimental setup for human-in-the-loopsimulations. A force feedback simulator with four axis motion has been setupfor real-time driving experiments. The simulator will move to simulate theforces a driver feels while driving, which allows for a realistic experiencefor the driver. This setup allows for flexibility and control for theresearcher in a realistic simulation environment. Experiments concerning driverdistraction can also be carried out safely in this test bed, in addition tomulti-agent experiments. All necessary code to run the simulator, theadditional sensors, and the basic processing is available for use.

On the Characterization of Local Nash Equilibria in Continuous Games

  We present a unified framework for characterizing local Nash equilibria incontinuous games on either infinite-dimensional or finite-dimensionalnon-convex strategy spaces. We provide intrinsic necessary and sufficientfirst- and second-order conditions ensuring strategies constitute local Nashequilibria. We term points satisfying the sufficient conditions differentialNash equilibria. Further, we provide a sufficient condition (non-degeneracy)guaranteeing differential Nash equilibria are isolated and show that suchequilibria are structurally stable. We present tutorial examples to illustrateour results and highlight degeneracies that can arise in continuous games.

On the Relaxation of Hybrid Dynamical Systems

  Hybrid dynamical systems have proven to be a powerful modeling abstraction,yet fundamental questions regarding the dynamical properties of these systemsremain. In this paper, we develop a novel class of relaxations which we use torecover a number of classic systems theoretic properties for hybrid systems,such as existence and uniqueness of trajectories, even past the point of Zeno.Our relaxations also naturally give rise to a class of provably convergentnumerical approximations, capable of simulating through Zeno. Using ourmethods, we are also able to perform sensitivity analysis about nominaltrajectories undergoing a discrete transition -- a technique with manypractical applications, such as assessing the stability of periodic orbits.

Modified Newton's rings: II

  In an earlier work (Shankar kumar Jha, A Vyas, O S K S Sastri, Rajkumar Jain& K S Umesh, 'Determination of wavelength of laser light using ModifiedNewton's rings setup', Physics Education, vol. 22, no.3, 195-202(2005))reported by our group, a version of Newton's rings experiment called ModifiedNewton's rings was proposed. The present work is an extension of this work.Here, a general formula for wavelength has been derived, applicable for a planeof observation at any distance. A relation between the focal length and theradius curvature is also derived for a plano-convex lens which is essentiallyused as a concave mirror. Tracker, a video analysis software, freelydownloadable from the net, is employed to analyze the fringes captured using aCCD camera. Two beams which give rise to interference fringes in conventionalNewton's rings and in the present setup are clearly distinguished.

Segmentation of Natural Images by Texture and Boundary Compression

  We present a novel algorithm for segmentation of natural images thatharnesses the principle of minimum description length (MDL). Our method isbased on observations that a homogeneously textured region of a natural imagecan be well modeled by a Gaussian distribution and the region boundary can beeffectively coded by an adaptive chain code. The optimal segmentation of animage is the one that gives the shortest coding length for encoding alltextures and boundaries in the image, and is obtained via an agglomerativeclustering process applied to a hierarchy of decreasing window sizes asmulti-scale texture features. The optimal segmentation also provides anaccurate estimate of the overall coding length and hence the true entropy ofthe image. We test our algorithm on the publicly available BerkeleySegmentation Dataset. It achieves state-of-the-art segmentation resultscompared to other existing methods.

Goal Inference Improves Objective and Perceived Performance in  Human-Robot Collaboration

  The study of human-robot interaction is fundamental to the design and use ofrobotics in real-world applications. Robots will need to predict and adapt tothe actions of human collaborators in order to achieve good performance andimprove safety and end-user adoption. This paper evaluates a human-robotcollaboration scheme that combines the task allocation and motion levels ofreasoning: the robotic agent uses Bayesian inference to predict the next goalof its human partner from his or her ongoing motion, and re-plans its ownactions in real time. This anticipative adaptation is desirable in manypractical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on thecognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to therobot. A behavioral experiment indicates that the combination of goal inferenceand dynamic task planning significantly improves both objective and perceivedperformance of the human-robot team. Participants were highly sensitive to thedifferences between robot behaviors, preferring to work with a robot thatadapted to their actions over one that did not.

Generating Plans that Predict Themselves

  Collaboration requires coordination, and we coordinate by anticipating ourteammates' future actions and adapting to their plan. In some cases, ourteammates' actions early on can give us a clear idea of what the remainder oftheir plan is, i.e. what action sequence we should expect. In others, theymight leave us less confident, or even lead us to the wrong conclusion. Ourgoal is for robot actions to fall in the first category: we want to enablerobots to select their actions in such a way that human collaborators caneasily use them to correctly anticipate what will follow. While previous workhas focused on finding initial plans that convey a set goal, here we focus onfinding two portions of a plan such that the initial portion conveys the finalone. We introduce $t$-\ACty{}: a measure that quantifies the accuracy andconfidence with which human observers can predict the remaining robot plan fromthe overall task goal and the observed initial $t$ actions in the plan. Wecontribute a method for generating $t$-predictable plans: we search for a fullplan that accomplishes the task, but in which the first $t$ actions make it aseasy as possible to infer the remaining ones. The result is often differentfrom the most efficient plan, in which the initial actions might leave a lot ofambiguity as to how the task will be completed. Through an online experimentand an in-person user study with physical robots, we find that our approachoutperforms a traditional efficiency-based planner in objective and subjectivecollaboration metrics.

A Learning Based Approach to Control Synthesis of Markov Decision  Processes for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications

  We propose to synthesize a control policy for a Markov decision process (MDP)such that the resulting traces of the MDP satisfy a linear temporal logic (LTL)property. We construct a product MDP that incorporates a deterministic Rabinautomaton generated from the desired LTL property. The reward function of theproduct MDP is defined from the acceptance condition of the Rabin automaton.This construction allows us to apply techniques from learning theory to theproblem of synthesis for LTL specifications even when the transitionprobabilities are not known a priori. We prove that our method is guaranteed tofind a controller that satisfies the LTL property with probability one if sucha policy exists, and we suggest empirically with a case study in trafficcontrol that our method produces reasonable control strategies even when theLTL property cannot be satisfied with probability one.

Dimension Reduction Near Periodic Orbits of Hybrid Systems

  When the Poincar\'{e} map associated with a periodic orbit of a hybriddynamical system has constant-rank iterates, we demonstrate the existence of aconstant-dimensional invariant subsystem near the orbit which attracts allnearby trajectories in finite time. This result shows that the long-termbehavior of a hybrid model with a large number of degrees-of-freedom may begoverned by a low-dimensional smooth dynamical system. The appearance of suchsimplified models enables the translation of analytical tools from smoothsystems-such as Floquet theory-to the hybrid setting and provides a bridgebetween the efforts of biologists and engineers studying legged locomotion.

On the Lagrangian Biduality of Sparsity Minimization Problems

  Recent results in Compressive Sensing have shown that, under certainconditions, the solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations withsparsity-based regularization can be accurately recovered by solving convexrelaxations of the original problem. In this work, we present a novelprimal-dual analysis on a class of sparsity minimization problems. We show thatthe Lagrangian bidual (i.e., the Lagrangian dual of the Lagrangian dual) of thesparsity minimization problems can be used to derive interesting convexrelaxations: the bidual of the $\ell_0$-minimization problem is the$\ell_1$-minimization problem; and the bidual of the $\ell_{0,1}$-minimizationproblem for enforcing group sparsity on structured data is the$\ell_{1,\infty}$-minimization problem. The analysis provides a means tocompute per-instance non-trivial lower bounds on the (group) sparsity of thedesired solutions. In a real-world application, the bidual relaxation improvesthe performance of a sparsity-based classification framework applied to robustface recognition.

Statistical Results on Filtering and Epi-convergence for Learning-Based  Model Predictive Control

  Learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) is a technique that providesdeterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification toolsare used to identify richer models of the system in order to improveperformance. This technical note provides proofs that elucidate the reasons forour choice of measurement model, as well as giving proofs concerning thestochastic convergence of LBMPC. The first part of this note discussessimultaneous state estimation and statistical identification (or learning) ofunmodeled dynamics, for dynamical systems that can be described by ordinarydifferential equations (ODE's). The second part provides proofs concerning theepi-convergence of different statistical estimators that can be used with thelearning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) technique. In particular, weprove results on the statistical properties of a nonparametric estimator thatwe have designed to have the correct deterministic and stochastic propertiesfor numerical implementation when used in conjunction with LBMPC.

Quadratic Basis Pursuit

  In many compressive sensing problems today, the relationship between themeasurements and the unknowns could be nonlinear. Traditional treatment of suchnonlinear relationships have been to approximate the nonlinearity via a linearmodel and the subsequent un-modeled dynamics as noise. The ability to moreaccurately characterize nonlinear models has the potential to improve theresults in both existing compressive sensing applications and those where alinear approximation does not suffice, e.g., phase retrieval. In this paper, weextend the classical compressive sensing framework to a second-order Taylorexpansion of the nonlinearity. Using a lifting technique and a method we callquadratic basis pursuit, we show that the sparse signal can be recoveredexactly when the sampling rate is sufficiently high. We further presentefficient numerical algorithms to recover sparse signals in second-ordernonlinear systems, which are considerably more difficult to solve than theirlinear counterparts in sparse optimization.

Compressive Shift Retrieval

  The classical shift retrieval problem considers two signals in vector formthat are related by a shift. The problem is of great importance in manyapplications and is typically solved by maximizing the cross-correlationbetween the two signals. Inspired by compressive sensing, in this paper, weseek to estimate the shift directly from compressed signals. We show that undercertain conditions, the shift can be recovered using fewer samples and lesscomputation compared to the classical setup. Of particular interest is shiftestimation from Fourier coefficients. We show that under rather mild conditionsonly one Fourier coefficient suffices to recover the true shift.

Blind Identification of ARX Models with Piecewise Constant Inputs

  Blind system identification is known to be a hard ill-posed problem andwithout further assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In thiscontribution, we are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model fromonly output measurements. Driven by the task of identifying systems that areturned on and off at unknown times, we seek a piecewise constant input and acorresponding ARX model which approximates the measured outputs. We phrase thisas a rank minimization problem and present a relaxed convex formulation toapproximate its solution. The proposed method was developed to model powerconsumption of electrical appliances and is now a part of a bigger energydisaggregation framework. Code will be made available online.

A Dynamical Systems Approach to Energy Disaggregation

  Energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), isthe task of separating aggregate energy data for a whole building into theenergy data for individual appliances. Studies have shown that simply providingdisaggregated data to the consumer improves energy consumption behavior.However, placing individual sensors on every device in a home is not presentlya practical solution. Disaggregation provides a feasible method for providingenergy usage behavior data to the consumer which utilizes currently existinginfrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel framework to perform theenergy disaggregation task. We model each individual device as a single-input,single-output system, where the output is the power consumed by the device andthe input is the device usage. In this framework, the task of disaggregationtranslates into finding inputs for each device that generates our observedpower consumption. We describe an implementation of this framework, and showits results on simulated data as well as data from a small-scale experiment.

Model Reduction Near Periodic Orbits of Hybrid Dynamical Systems

  We show that, near periodic orbits, a class of hybrid models can be reducedto or approximated by smooth continuous-time dynamical systems. Specifically,near an exponentially stable periodic orbit undergoing isolated transitions ina hybrid dynamical system, nearby executions generically contractsuperexponentially to a constant-dimensional subsystem. Under a non-degeneracycondition on the rank deficiency of the associated Poincare map, thecontraction occurs in finite time regardless of the stability properties of theorbit. Hybrid transitions may be removed from the resulting subsystem via atopological quotient that admits a smooth structure to yield an equivalentsmooth dynamical system. We demonstrate reduction of a high-dimensionalunderactuated mechanical model for terrestrial locomotion, assess structuralstability of deadbeat controllers for rhythmic locomotion and manipulation, andderive a normal form for the stability basin of a hybrid oscillator. Theseapplications illustrate the utility of our theoretical results for synthesisand analysis of feedback control laws for rhythmic hybrid behavior.

Scalable Anomaly Detection in Large Homogenous Populations

  Anomaly detection in large populations is a challenging but highly relevantproblem. The problem is essentially a multi-hypothesis problem, with ahypothesis for every division of the systems into normal and anomal systems.The number of hypothesis grows rapidly with the number of systems andapproximate solutions become a necessity for any problems of practicalinterests. In the current paper we take an optimization approach to thismulti-hypothesis problem. We first observe that the problem is equivalent to anon-convex combinatorial optimization problem. We then relax the problem to aconvex problem that can be solved distributively on the systems and that stayscomputationally tractable as the number of systems increase. An interestingproperty of the proposed method is that it can under certain conditions beshown to give exactly the same result as the combinatorial multi-hypothesisproblem and the relaxation is hence tight.

Nonlinear Compressive Particle Filtering

  Many systems for which compressive sensing is used today are dynamical. Thecommon approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence ofindependent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, thetemporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of thestate estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its supportcould be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In thelinear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with theKalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case,compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, theparticle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the mostnovel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, withthe particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and thatneither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives asatisfying solution.

Robust Subspace System Identification via Weighted Nuclear Norm  Optimization

  Subspace identification is a classical and very well studied problem insystem identification. The problem was recently posed as a convex optimizationproblem via the nuclear norm relaxation. Inspired by robust PCA, we extend thisframework to handle outliers. The proposed framework takes the form of a convexoptimization problem with an objective that trades off fit, rank and sparsity.As in robust PCA, it can be problematic to find a suitable regularizationparameter. We show how the space in which a suitable parameter should be soughtcan be limited to a bounded open set of the two dimensional parameter space. Inpractice, this is very useful since it restricts the parameter space that isneeded to be surveyed.

Privacy and Customer Segmentation in the Smart Grid

  In the electricity grid, networked sensors which record and transmitincreasingly high-granularity data are being deployed. In such a setting,privacy concerns are a natural consideration. We present an attack model forprivacy breaches, and, using results from estimation theory, derive theoreticalresults ensuring that an adversary will fail to infer private information witha certain probability, independent of the algorithm used. We show utilitycompanies would benefit from less noisy, higher frequency data, as it wouldimprove various smart grid operations such as load prediction. We provide amethod to quantify how smart grid operations improve as a function of higherfrequency data. In order to obtain the consumer's valuation of privacy, wedesign a screening mechanism consisting of a menu of contracts to the energyconsumer with varying guarantees of privacy. The screening process is a meansto segment customers. Finally, we design insurance contracts using theprobability of a privacy breach to be offered by third-party insurancecompanies.

Quantifying the Utility-Privacy Tradeoff in the Smart Grid

  The modernization of the electrical grid and the installation of smart meterscome with many advantages to control and monitoring. However, in the wronghands, the data might pose a privacy threat. In this paper, we consider thetradeoff between smart grid operations and the privacy of consumers. We analyzethe tradeoff between smart grid operations and how often data is collected byconsidering a realistic direct-load control example using thermostaticallycontrolled loads, and we give simulation results to show how its performancedegrades as the sampling frequency decreases. Additionally, we introduce a newprivacy metric, which we call inferential privacy. This privacy metric assumesa strong adversary model, and provides an upper bound on the adversary'sability to infer a private parameter, independent of the algorithm he uses.Combining these two results allow us to directly consider the tradeoff betweenbetter load control and consumer privacy.

Social Game for Building Energy Efficiency: Utility Learning,  Simulation, and Analysis

  We describe a social game that we designed for encouraging energy efficientbehavior amongst building occupants with the aim of reducing overall energyconsumption in the building. Occupants vote for their desired lighting leveland win points which are used in a lottery based on how far their vote is fromthe maximum setting. We assume that the occupants are utility maximizers andthat their utility functions capture the tradeoff between winning points andtheir comfort level. We model the occupants as non-cooperative agents in acontinuous game and we characterize their play using the Nash equilibriumconcept. Using occupant voting data, we parameterize their utility functionsand use a convex optimization problem to estimate the parameters. We simulatethe game defined by the estimated utility functions and show that the estimatedmodel for occupant behavior is a good predictor of their actual behavior. Inaddition, we show that due to the social game, there is a significant reductionin energy consumption.

Rapid Integration and Calibration of New Sensors Using the Berkeley  Aachen Robotics Toolkit (BART)

  After the three DARPA Grand Challenge contests many groups around the worldhave continued to actively research and work toward an autonomous vehiclecapable of accomplishing a mission in a given context (e.g. desert, city) whilefollowing a set of prescribed rules, but none has been completely successful inuncontrolled environments, a task that many people trivially fulfill every day.We believe that, together with improving the sensors used in cars and theartificial intelligence algorithms used to process the information, thecommunity should focus on the systems engineering aspects of the problem, i.e.the limitations of the car (in terms of space, power, or heat dissipation) andthe limitations of the software development cycle. This paper explores theseissues and our experiences overcoming them.

Effects of Risk on Privacy Contracts for Demand-Side Management

  As smart meters continue to be deployed around the world collectingunprecedented levels of fine-grained data about consumers, we need to findmechanisms that are fair to both, (1) the electric utility who needs the datato improve their operations, and (2) the consumer who has a valuation ofprivacy but at the same time benefits from sharing consumption data. In thispaper we address this problem by proposing privacy contracts between electricutilities and consumers with the goal of maximizing the social welfare of both.Our mathematical model designs an optimization problem between a population ofusers that have different valuations on privacy and the costs of operation bythe utility. We then show how contracts can change depending on the probabilityof a privacy breach. This line of research can help inform not only current butalso future smart meter collection practices.

Differential Privacy of Populations in Routing Games

  As our ground transportation infrastructure modernizes, the large amount ofdata being measured, transmitted, and stored motivates an analysis of theprivacy aspect of these emerging cyber-physical technologies. In this paper, weconsider privacy in the routing game, where the origins and destinations ofdrivers are considered private. This is motivated by the fact that thisspatiotemporal information can easily be used as the basis for inferences for aperson's activities. More specifically, we consider the differential privacy ofthe mapping from the amount of flow for each origin-destination pair to thetraffic flow measurements on each link of a traffic network. We use astochastic online learning framework for the population dynamics, which isknown to converge to the Nash equilibrium of the routing game. We analyze thesensitivity of this process and provide theoretical guarantees on theconvergence rates as well as differential privacy values for these models. Weconfirm these with simulations on a small example.

Diagnosis and Repair for Synthesis from Signal Temporal Logic  Specifications

  We address the problem of diagnosing and repairing specifications for hybridsystems formalized in signal temporal logic (STL). Our focus is on the settingof automatic synthesis of controllers in a model predictive control (MPC)framework. We build on recent approaches that reduce the controller synthesisproblem to solving one or more mixed integer linear programs (MILPs), whereinfeasibility of a MILP usually indicates unrealizability of the controllersynthesis problem. Given an infeasible STL synthesis problem, we presentalgorithms that provide feedback on the reasons for unrealizability, andsuggestions for making it realizable. Our algorithms are sound and complete,i.e., they provide a correct diagnosis, and always terminate with a non-trivialspecification that is feasible using the chosen synthesis method, when such asolution exists. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on thesynthesis of controllers for various cyber-physical systems, including anautonomous driving application and an aircraft electric power system.

Privacy-Enhanced Architecture for Occupancy-based HVAC Control

  Large-scale sensing and actuation infrastructures have allowed buildings toachieve significant energy savings; at the same time, these technologiesintroduce significant privacy risks that must be addressed. In this paper, wepresent a framework for modeling the trade-off between improved controlperformance and increased privacy risks due to occupancy sensing. Morespecifically, we consider occupancy-based HVAC control as the control objectiveand the location traces of individual occupants as the private variables.Previous studies have shown that individual location information can beinferred from occupancy measurements. To ensure privacy, we design anarchitecture that distorts the occupancy data in order to hide individualoccupant location information while maintaining HVAC performance. Using mutualinformation between the individual's location trace and the reported occupancymeasurement as a privacy metric, we are able to optimally design a scheme tominimize privacy risk subject to a control performance guarantee. We evaluateour framework using real-world occupancy data: first, we verify that ourprivacy metric accurately assesses the adversary's ability to infer privatevariables from the distorted sensor measurements; then, we show that controlperformance is maintained through simulations of building operations usingthese distorted occupancy readings.

Optimal Causal Imputation for Control

  The widespread applicability of analytics in cyber-physical systems hasmotivated research into causal inference methods. Predictive estimators are notsufficient when analytics are used for decision making; rather, the flow ofcausal effects must be determined. Generally speaking, these methods focus onestimation of a causal structure from experimental data. In this paper, weconsider the dual problem: we fix the causal structure and optimize over causalimputations to achieve desirable system behaviors for a minimal imputationcost. First, we present the optimal causal imputation problem, and then weanalyze the problem in two special cases: 1) when the causal imputations canonly impute to a fixed value, 2) when the causal structure has linear dynamicswith additive Gaussian noise. This optimal causal imputation framework servesto bridge the gap between causal structures and control.

Statistical Estimation with Strategic Data Sources in Competitive  Settings

  In this paper, we introduce a preliminary model for interactions in the datamarket. Recent research has shown ways in which a data aggregator can designmechanisms for users to ensure the quality of data, even in situations wherethe users are effort-averse (i.e. prefer to submit lower-quality estimates) andthe data aggregator cannot observe the effort exerted by the users (i.e. thecontract suffers from the principal-agent problem). However, we have shown thatthese mechanisms often break down in more realistic models, where multiple dataaggregators are in competition. Under minor assumptions on the properties ofthe statistical estimators in use by data aggregators, we show that there iseither no Nash equilibrium, or there is an infinite number of Nash equilibrium.In the latter case, there is a fundamental ambiguity in who bears the burden ofincentivizing different data sources. We are also able to calculate the priceof anarchy, which measures how much social welfare is lost between the Nashequilibrium and the social optimum, i.e. between non-cooperative strategic playand cooperation.

A Robust Utility Learning Framework via Inverse Optimization

  In many smart infrastructure applications flexibility in achievingsustainability goals can be gained by engaging end-users. However, these usersoften have heterogeneous preferences that are unknown to the decision-makertasked with improving operational efficiency. Modeling user interaction as acontinuous game between non-cooperative players, we propose a robust parametricutility learning framework that employs constrained feasible generalized leastsquares estimation with heteroskedastic inference. To improve forecastingperformance, we extend the robust utility learning scheme by employingbootstrapping with bagging, bumping, and gradient boosting ensemble methods.Moreover, we estimate the noise covariance which provides approximatedcorrelations between players which we leverage to develop a novel correlatedutility learning framework. We apply the proposed methods both to a toy examplearising from Bertrand-Nash competition between two firms as well as to datafrom a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavioramongst smart building occupants. Using occupant voting data for sharedresources such as lighting, we simulate the game defined by the estimatedutility functions to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.

A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach for Online Expert Selection in Markov  Decision Processes

  We formulate a multi-armed bandit (MAB) approach to choosing expert policiesonline in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Given a set of expert policiestrained on a state and action space, the goal is to maximize the cumulativereward of our agent. The hope is to quickly find the best expert in our set.The MAB formulation allows us to quantify the performance of an algorithm interms of the regret incurred from not choosing the best expert from thebeginning. We first develop the theoretical framework for MABs in MDPs, andthen present a basic regret decomposition identity. We then adapt the classicalUpper Confidence Bounds algorithm to the problem of choosing experts in MDPsand prove that the expected regret grows at worst at a logarithmic rate.Lastly, we validate the theory on a small MDP.

People as Sensors: Imputing Maps from Human Actions

  Despite growing attention in autonomy, there are still many open problems,including how autonomous vehicles will interact and communicate with otheragents, such as human drivers and pedestrians. Unlike most approaches thatfocus on pedestrian detection and planning for collision avoidance, this paperconsiders modeling the interaction between human drivers and pedestrians andhow it might influence map estimation, as a proxy for detection. We take amapping inspired approach and incorporate people as sensors into mappingframeworks. By taking advantage of other agents' actions, we demonstrate how wecan impute portions of the map that would otherwise be occluded. We evaluateour framework in human driving experiments and on real-world data, usingoccupancy grids and landmark-based mapping approaches. Our approachsignificantly improves overall environment awareness and out-performs standardmapping techniques.

A New Solution Concept and Family of Relaxations for Hybrid Dynamical  Systems

  We introduce a holistic framework for the analysis, approximation and controlof the trajectories of hybrid dynamical systems which display event-triggereddiscrete jumps in the continuous state. We begin by demonstrating how toexplicitly represent the dynamics of this class of systems using a singlepiecewise-smooth vector field defined on a manifold, and then employ Filippov'ssolution concept to describe the trajectories of the system. The resulting\emph{hybrid Filippov solutions} greatly simplify the mathematical descriptionof hybrid executions, providing a unifying solution concept with which to work.Extending previous efforts to regularize piecewise-smooth vector fields, wethen introduce a parameterized family of smooth control systems whosetrajectories are used to approximate the hybrid Filippov solution numerically.The two solution concepts are shown to agree in the limit, under mildregularity conditions.

Step Size Matters in Deep Learning

  Training a neural network with the gradient descent algorithm gives rise to adiscrete-time nonlinear dynamical system. Consequently, behaviors that aretypically observed in these systems emerge during training, such as convergenceto an orbit but not to a fixed point or dependence of convergence on theinitialization. Step size of the algorithm plays a critical role in thesebehaviors: it determines the subset of the local optima that the algorithm canconverge to, and it specifies the magnitude of the oscillations if thealgorithm converges to an orbit. To elucidate the effects of the step size ontraining of neural networks, we study the gradient descent algorithm as adiscrete-time dynamical system, and by analyzing the Lyapunov stability ofdifferent solutions, we show the relationship between the step size of thealgorithm and the solutions that can be obtained with this algorithm. Theresults provide an explanation for several phenomena observed in practice,including the deterioration in the training error with increased depth, thehardness of estimating linear mappings with large singular values, and thedistinct performance of deep residual networks.

On Finding Local Nash Equilibria (and Only Local Nash Equilibria) in  Zero-Sum Games

  We propose local symplectic surgery, a two-timescale procedure for findinglocal Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. We first show that previousgradient-based algorithms cannot guarantee convergence to local Nash equilibriadue to the existence of non-Nash stationary points. By taking advantage of thedifferential structure of the game, we construct an algorithm for which thelocal Nash equilibria are the only attracting fixed points. We also show thatthe algorithm exhibits no oscillatory behaviors in neighborhoods of equilibriaand show that it has the same per-iteration complexity as other recentlyproposed algorithms. We conclude by validating the algorithm on two numericalexamples: a toy example with multiple Nash equilibria and a non-Nashequilibrium, and the training of a small generative adversarial network (GAN).

Technical Report: Optimal Control of Piecwise-smooth Control Systems via  Singular Perturbations

  This paper investigates optimal control problems formulated over a class ofpiecewise-smooth vector fields. Instead of optimizing over the discontinuoussystem directly, we instead formulate optimal control problems over a family ofregularizations which are obtained by "smoothing out" the discontinuity in theoriginal system. It is shown that the smooth problems can be used to obtainaccurate derivative information about the non-smooth problem, under standardregularity conditions. We then indicate how the regularizations can be used toconsistently approximate the non-smooth optimal control problem in the sense ofPolak. The utility of these smoothing techniques is demonstrated in an in-depthexample, where we utilize recently developed reduced-order modeling techniquesfrom the dynamic walking community to generate motion plans across contactsequences for a 18-DOF model of a lower-body exoskeleton.

A low frequency radio telescope at Mauritius for a Southern sky survey

  A new, meter-wave radio telescope has been built in the North-East ofMauritius, an island in the Indian ocean, at a latitude of -20.14 deg. TheMauritius Radio Telescope (MRT) is a Fourier Synthesis T-shaped array,consisting of a 2048 m long East-West arm and a 880 m long South arm. In theEast-West arm 1024 fixed helices are arranged in 32 groups and in the South arm16 trolleys, with four helices on each, which move on a rail are used. A 512channel digital complex correlation receiver is used to measure the visibilityfunction. At least 60 days of observing are required for obtaining thevisibilities up to 880 m spacing. The Fourier transform of the calibratedvisibilities produces a map of the area of the sky under observation with asynthesized beam width 4'X 4.6'sec(dec+20.14) at 151.5 MHz.  The primary objective of the telescope is to produce a sky survey in thedeclination range -70 deg to -10 deg with a point source sensitivity of about200 mJy (3-sigma level). This will be the southern sky equivalent of theCambridge 6C survey. In this paper we describe the telescope, discuss the arraydesign and the calibration techniques used, and present a map made using thetelescope.

Fast L1-Minimization Algorithms For Robust Face Recognition

  L1-minimization refers to finding the minimum L1-norm solution to anunderdetermined linear system b=Ax. Under certain conditions as described incompressive sensing theory, the minimum L1-norm solution is also the sparsestsolution. In this paper, our study addresses the speed and scalability of itsalgorithms. In particular, we focus on the numerical implementation of asparsity-based classification framework in robust face recognition, wheresparse representation is sought to recover human identities from veryhigh-dimensional facial images that may be corrupted by illumination, facialdisguise, and pose variation. Although the underlying numerical problem is alinear program, traditional algorithms are known to suffer poor scalability forlarge-scale applications. We investigate a new solution based on a classicalconvex optimization framework, known as Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM). Thenew convex solvers provide a viable solution to real-world, time-criticalapplications such as face recognition. We conduct extensive experiments tovalidate and compare the performance of the ALM algorithms against severalpopular L1-minimization solvers, including interior-point method, Homotopy,FISTA, SESOP-PCD, approximate message passing (AMP) and TFOCS. To aid peerevaluation, the code for all the algorithms has been made publicly available.

Provably Safe and Robust Learning-Based Model Predictive Control

  Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, andthe reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus onthe former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performanceto deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-basedmodel predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guaranteeson robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identifyricher models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits ofthis framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizessystem performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to usea wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The maininsight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled underreasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models ofthe system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty,and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improvesperformance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learneddynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these sameinputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty.Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPCcontrol action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using thetrue dynamics.

Compressive Phase Retrieval From Squared Output Measurements Via  Semidefinite Programming

  Given a linear system in a real or complex domain, linear regression aims torecover the model parameters from a set of observations. Recent studies incompressive sensing have successfully shown that under certain conditions, alinear program, namely, l1-minimization, guarantees recovery of sparseparameter signals even when the system is underdetermined. In this paper, weconsider a more challenging problem: when the phase of the output measurementsfrom a linear system is omitted. Using a lifting technique, we show that eventhough the phase information is missing, the sparse signal can be recoveredexactly by solving a simple semidefinite program when the sampling rate issufficiently high, albeit the exact solutions to both sparse signal recoveryand phase retrieval are combinatorial. The results extend the type ofapplications that compressive sensing can be applied to those where only outputmagnitudes can be observed. We demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithmsthrough theoretical analysis, extensive simulations and a practical experiment.

Consistent Approximations for the Optimal Control of Constrained  Switched Systems

  Though switched dynamical systems have shown great utility in modeling avariety of physical phenomena, the construction of an optimal control of suchsystems has proven difficult since it demands some type of optimal modescheduling. In this paper, we devise an algorithm for the computation of anoptimal control of constrained nonlinear switched dynamical systems. Thecontrol parameter for such systems include a continuous-valued input anddiscrete-valued input, where the latter corresponds to the mode of the switchedsystem that is active at a particular instance in time. Our approach, which weprove converges to local minimizers of the constrained optimal control problem,first relaxes the discrete-valued input, then performs traditional optimalcontrol, and then projects the constructed relaxed discrete-valued input backto a pure discrete-valued input by employing an extension to the classicalChattering Lemma that we prove. We extend this algorithm by formulating acomputationally implementable algorithm which works by discretizing the timeinterval over which the switched dynamical system is defined. Importantly, weprove that this implementable algorithm constructs a sequence of points byrecursive application that converge to the local minimizers of the originalconstrained optimal control problem. Four simulation experiments are includedto validate the theoretical developments.

Incentive Mechanisms for Internet Congestion Management: Fixed-Budget  Rebate versus Time-of-Day Pricing

  Mobile data traffic has been steadily rising in the past years. This hasgenerated a significant interest in the deployment of incentive mechanisms toreduce peak-time congestion. Typically, the design of these mechanisms requiresinformation about user demand and sensitivity to prices. Such information isnaturally imperfect. In this paper, we propose a \emph{fixed-budget rebatemechanism} that gives each user a reward proportional to his percentagecontribution to the aggregate reduction in peak time demand. For comparison, wealso study a time-of-day pricing mechanism that gives each user a fixed rewardper unit reduction of his peak-time demand. To evaluate the two mechanisms, weintroduce a game-theoretic model that captures the \emph{public good} nature ofdecongestion. For each mechanism, we demonstrate that the socially optimallevel of decongestion is achievable for a specific choice of the mechanism'sparameter. We then investigate how imperfect information about user demandaffects the mechanisms' effectiveness. From our results, the fixed-budgetrebate pricing is more robust when the users' sensitivity to congestion is"sufficiently" convex. This feature of the fixed-budget rebate mechanism isattractive for many situations of interest and is driven by its closed-loopproperty, i.e., the unit reward decreases as the peak-time demand decreases.
