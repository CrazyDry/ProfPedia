This paper studiesnegative user behavior in the Ask.fm social network, a popular new site thathas led to many cases of cyberbullying, some leading to suicidal behavior.Weexamine the occurrence of negative words in Ask.fms question+answer profilesalong with the social network of likes of questions+answers. We also examineproperties of users with cutting behavior in this social network.

Motif Iteration Model for Network Representation

  Social media mining has become one of the most popular research areas in BigData with the explosion of social networking information from Facebook,Twitter, LinkedIn, Weibo and so on. Understanding and representing thestructure of a social network is a key in social media mining. In this paper,we propose the Motif Iteration Model (MIM) to represent the structure of asocial network. As the name suggested, the new model is based on iteration ofbasic network motifs. In order to better show the properties of the model, aheuristic and greedy algorithm called Vertex Reordering and Arranging (VRA) isproposed by studying the adjacency matrix of the three-vertex undirectednetwork motifs. The algorithm is for mapping from the adjacency matrix of anetwork to a binary image, it shows a new perspective of network structurevisualization. In summary, this model provides a useful approach towardsbuilding link between images and networks and offers a new way of representingthe structure of a social network.

Registration of Images with Outliers Using Joint Saliency Map

  Mutual information (MI) is a popular similarity measure for imageregistration, whereby good registration can be achieved by maximizing thecompactness of the clusters in the joint histogram. However, MI is sensitive tothe "outlier" objects that appear in one image but not the other, and alsosuffers from local and biased maxima. We propose a novel joint saliency map(JSM) to highlight the corresponding salient structures in the two images, andemphatically group those salient structures into the smoothed compact clustersin the weighted joint histogram. This strategy could solve both the outlier andthe local maxima problems. Experimental results show that the JSM-MI basedalgorithm is not only accurate but also robust for registration of challengingimage pairs with outliers.

Reducing Poisson noise and baseline drift in X-ray spectral images with  bootstrap Poisson regression and robust nonparametric regression

  X-ray spectral imaging provides quantitative imaging of trace elements inbiological sample with high sensitivity. We propose a novel algorithm topromote the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of X-ray spectral images that have lowphoton counts. Firstly, we estimate the image data area that belongs to thehomogeneous parts through confidence interval testing. Then, we apply thePoisson regression through its maximum likelihood estimation on this area toestimate the true photon counts from the Poisson noise corrupted data. Unlikeother denoising methods based on regression analysis, we use the bootstrapresampling method to ensure the accuracy of regression estimation. Finally, weuse a robust local nonparametric regression method to estimate the baseline andsubsequently subtract it from the X-ray spectral data to further improve theSNR of the data. Experiments on several real samples show that the proposedmethod performs better than some state-of-the-art approaches to ensure accuracyand precision for quantitative analysis of the different trace elements instandard reference biological sample.

Local Structure Matching Driven by Joint-Saliency-Structure Adaptive  Kernel Regression

  For nonrigid image registration, matching the particular structures (or theoutliers) that have missing correspondence and/or local large deformations, canbe more difficult than matching the common structures with small deformationsin the two images. Most existing works depend heavily on the outliersegmentation to remove the outlier effect in the registration. Moreover, theseworks do not handle simultaneously the missing correspondences and local largedeformations. In this paper, we defined the nonrigid image registration as alocal adaptive kernel regression which locally reconstruct the moving image'sdense deformation vectors from the sparse deformation vectors in themulti-resolution block matching. The kernel function of the kernel regressionadapts its shape and orientation to the reference image's structure to gathermore deformation vector samples of the same structure for the iterativeregression computation, whereby the moving image's local deformations could becompliant with the reference image's local structures. To estimate the localdeformations around the outliers, we use joint saliency map that highlights thecorresponding saliency structures (called Joint Saliency Structures, JSSs) inthe two images to guide the dense deformation reconstruction by emphasizingthose JSSs' sparse deformation vectors in the kernel regression. Theexperimental results demonstrate that by using local JSS adaptive kernelregression, the proposed method achieves almost the best performance inalignment of all challenging image pairs with outlier structures compared withother five state-of-the-art nonrigid registration algorithms.

Texture variation adaptive image denoising with nonlocal PCA

  Image textures, as a kind of local variations, provide important informationfor human visual system. Many image textures, especially the small-scale orstochastic textures are rich in high-frequency variations, and are difficult tobe preserved. Current state-of-the-art denoising algorithms typically adopt anonlocal approach consisting of image patch grouping and group-wise denoisingfiltering. To achieve a better image denoising while preserving the variationsin texture, we first adaptively group high correlated image patches with thesame kinds of texture elements (texels) via an adaptive clustering method. Thisadaptive clustering method is applied in anover-clustering-and-iterative-merging approach, where its noise robustness isimproved with a custom merging threshold relating to the noise level andcluster size. For texture-preserving denoising of each cluster, consideringthat the variations in texture are captured and wrapped in not only thebetween-dimension energy variations but also the within-dimension variations ofPCA transform coefficients, we further propose a PCA-transform-domain variationadaptive filtering method to preserve the local variations in textures.Experiments on natural images show the superiority of the proposedtransform-domain variation adaptive filtering to traditional PCA-based hard orsoft threshold filtering. As a whole, the proposed denoising method achieves afavorable texture preserving performance both quantitatively and visually,especially for stochastic textures, which is further verified in camera rawimage denoising.

SafeVchat: Detecting Obscene Content and Misbehaving Users in Online  Video Chat Services

  Online video chat services such as Chatroulette, Omegle, and vChatter thatrandomly match pairs of users in video chat sessions are fast becoming verypopular, with over a million users per month in the case of Chatroulette. A keyproblem encountered in such systems is the presence of flashers and obscenecontent. This problem is especially acute given the presence of underage minorsin such systems. This paper presents SafeVchat, a novel solution to the problemof flasher detection that employs an array of image detection algorithms. A keycontribution of the paper concerns how the results of the individual detectorsare fused together into an overall decision classifying the user as misbehavingor not, based on Dempster-Shafer Theory. The paper introduces a novel,motion-based skin detection method that achieves significantly higher recalland better precision. The proposed methods have been evaluated over real worlddata and image traces obtained from Chatroulette.com.

Return probability and k-step measures

  The notion of return probability -- explored most famously by GeorgeP\'{o}lya on d-dimensional lattices -- has potential as a measure for theanalysis of networks. We present an efficient method for finding returnprobability distributions for connected undirected graphs. We argue that returnprobability has the same discriminatory power as existing k-step measures -- inparticular, beta centrality (with negative beta), the graph-theoretical powerindex (GPI), and subgraph centrality. We compare the running time of ouralgorithm to beta centrality and subgraph centrality and find that it issignificantly faster. When return probability is used to measure the samephenomena as beta centrality, it runs in linear time -- O(n+m), where n and mare the number of nodes and edges, respectively -- which takes much less timethan either the matrix inversion or the sequence of matrix multiplicationsrequired for calculating the exact or approximate forms of beta centrality,respectively. We call this form of return probability the P\'{o}lya power index(PPI). Computing subgraph centrality requires an expensive eigendecompositionof the adjacency matrix; return probability runs in half the time of theeigendecomposition on a 2000-node network. These performance improvements areimportant because computationally efficient measures are necessary in order toanalyze large networks.

Results from a Practical Deployment of the MyZone Decentralized P2P  Social Network

  This paper presents MyZone, a private online social network for relativelysmall, closely-knit communities. MyZone has three important distinguishingfeatures. First, users keep the ownership of their data and have completecontrol over maintaining their privacy. Second, MyZone is free from anypossibility of content censorship and is highly resilient to any single pointof disconnection. Finally, MyZone minimizes deployment cost by minimizing itscomputation, storage and network bandwidth requirements. It incorporates both aP2P architecture and a centralized architecture in its design ensuring highavailability, security and privacy. A prototype of MyZone was deployed over aperiod of 40 days with a membership of more than one hundred users. The paperprovides a detailed evaluation of the results obtained from this deployment.

A Comparison of Common Users across Instagram and Ask.fm to Better  Understand Cyberbullying

  This paper examines users who are common to two popular online socialnetworks, Instagram and Ask.fm, that are often used for cyberbullying. Ananalysis of the negativity and positivity of word usage in posts by commonusers of these two social networks is performed. These results are normalizedin comparison to a sample of typical users in both networks. We also examinethe posting activity of common user profiles and consider its correlation withnegativity. Within the Ask.fm social network, which allows anonymous posts, therelationship between anonymity and negativity is further explored.

A detailed analysis of the labeled data is thenpresented, including a study of relationships between cyberbullying and a hostof features such as cyberaggression, profanity, social graph features, temporalcommenting behavior, linguistic content, and image content. Using the labeleddata, we further design and evaluate the performance of classifiers toautomatically detect and pre- dict incidents of cyberbullying andcyberaggression.

Applying High-Resolution Visible Imagery to Satellite Melt Pond Fraction  Retrieval: A Neural Network Approach

  During summer, melt ponds have a significant influence on Arctic sea-icealbedo. The melt pond fraction (MPF) also has the ability to forecast theArctic sea-ice in a certain period. It is important to retrieve accurate meltpond fraction (MPF) from satellite data for Arctic research. This paperproposes a satellite MPF retrieval model based on the multi-layer neuralnetwork, named MPF-NN. Our model uses multi-spectral satellite data as modelinput and MPF information from multi-site and multi-period visible imagery asprior knowledge for modeling. It can effectively model melt ponds evolution ofdifferent regions and periods over the Arctic. Evaluation results show that theMPF retrieved from MODIS data using the proposed model has an RMSE of 3.91% anda correlation coefficient of 0.73. The seasonal distribution of MPF is alsoconsistent with previous results.

Event Organization 101: Understanding Latent Factors of Event Popularity

  The problem of understanding people's participation in real-world events hasbeen a subject of active research and can offer valuable insights for humanbehavior analysis and event-related recommendation/advertisement. In this work,we study the latent factors for determining event popularity using large-scaledatasets collected from the popular Meetup.com EBSN in three major citiesaround the world. We have conducted modeling analysis of four contextualfactors (spatial, group, temporal, and semantic), and also developed agroup-based social influence propagation network to model group-specificinfluences on events. By combining the Contextual features And Social InfluenceNetwOrk, our integrated prediction framework CASINO can capture the diverseinfluential factors of event participation and can be used by event organizersto predict/improve the popularity of their events. Evaluations demonstrate thatour CASINO framework achieves high prediction accuracy with contributions fromall the latent features we capture.

Understanding Group Event Scheduling via the OutWithFriendz Mobile  Application

  The wide adoption of smartphones and mobile applications has broughtsignificant changes to not only how individuals behave in the real world, butalso how groups of users interact with each other when organizing group events.Understanding how users make event decisions as a group and identifying thecontributing factors can offer important insights for social group studies andmore effective system and application design for group event scheduling.  In this work, we have designed a new mobile application calledOutWithFriendz, which enables users of our mobile app to organize group events,invite friends, suggest and vote on event time and venue. We have deployedOutWithFriendz at both Apple App Store and Google Play, and conducted alarge-scale user study spanning over 500 users and 300 group events. Ouranalysis has revealed several important observations regarding group eventplanning process including the importance of user mobility, individualpreferences, host preferences, and group voting process.

Crowd-Powered Sensing and Actuation in Smart Cities: Current Issues and  Future Directions

  With the advent of seamless connection of human, machine, and smart things,there is an emerging trend to leverage the power of crowds (e.g., citizens,mobile devices, and smart things) to monitor what is happening in a city,understand how the city is evolving, and further take actions to enable betterquality of life, which is referred to as Crowd-Powered Smart City (CPSC). Inthis article, we provide a literature review for CPSC and identify futureresearch opportunities. Specifically, we first define the concepts with typicalCPSC applications. Then, we present the main characteristics of CPSC andfurther highlight the research issues. In the end, we point out existinglimitations which can inform and guide future research directions.

HyTasker: Hybrid Task Allocation in Mobile Crowd Sensing

  Task allocation is a major challenge in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). Whileprevious task allocation approaches follow either the opportunistic orparticipatory mode, this paper proposes to integrate these two complementarymodes in a two-phased hybrid framework called HyTasker. In the offline phase, agroup of workers (called opportunistic workers) are selected, and they completeMCS tasks during their daily routines (i.e., opportunistic mode). In the onlinephase, we assign another set of workers (called participatory workers) andrequire them to move specifically to perform tasks that are not completed bythe opportunistic workers (i.e., participatory mode). Instead of consideringthese two phases separately, HyTasker jointly optimizes them with a totalincentive budget constraint. In particular, when selecting opportunisticworkers in the offline phase of HyTasker, we propose a novel algorithm thatsimultaneously considers the predicted task assignment for the participatoryworkers, in which the density and mobility of participatory workers are takeninto account. Experiments on a real-world mobility dataset demonstrate thatHyTasker outperforms other methods with more completed tasks under the samebudget constraint.

Collaborative Filtering with Stability

  Collaborative filtering (CF) is a popular technique in today's recommendersystems, and matrix approximation-based CF methods have achieved great successin both rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks. However, real-worlduser-item rating matrices are typically sparse, incomplete and noisy, whichintroduce challenges to the algorithm stability of matrix approximation, i.e.,small changes in the training data may significantly change the models. As aresult, existing matrix approximation solutions yield low generalizationperformance, exhibiting high error variance on the training data, andminimizing the training error may not guarantee error reduction on the testdata. This paper investigates the algorithm stability problem of matrixapproximation methods and how to achieve stable collaborative filtering viastable matrix approximation. We present a new algorithm design framework, which(1) introduces new optimization objectives to guide stable matrix approximationalgorithm design, and (2) solves the optimization problem to obtain stableapproximation solutions with good generalization performance. Experimentalresults on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achievebetter accuracy compared with state-of-the-art matrix approximation methods andensemble methods in both rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks.

A Scalable Algorithm for Privacy-Preserving Item-based Top-N  Recommendation

  Recommender systems have become an indispensable component in online servicesduring recent years. Effective recommendation is essential for improving theservices of various online business applications. However, serious privacyconcerns have been raised on recommender systems requiring the collection ofusers' private information for recommendation. At the same time, the success ofe-commerce has generated massive amounts of information, making scalability akey challenge in the design of recommender systems. As such, it is desirablefor recommender systems to protect users' privacy while achieving high-qualityrecommendations with low-complexity computations.  This paper proposes a scalable privacy-preserving item-based top-Nrecommendation solution, which can achieve high-quality recommendations withreduced computation complexity while ensuring that users' private informationis protected. Furthermore, the computation complexity of the proposed methodincreases slowly as the number of users increases, thus providing highscalability for privacy-preserving recommender systems. More specifically, theproposed approach consists of two key components: (1) MinHash-based similarityestimation and (2) client-side privacy-preserving prediction generation. Ourtheoretical and experimental analysis using real-world data demonstrates theefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Earthquake Early Warning and Beyond: Systems Challenges in  Smartphone-based Seismic Network

  Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems can effectively reduce fatalities,injuries, and damages caused by earthquakes. Current EEW systems are mostlybased on traditional seismic and geodetic networks, and exist only in a fewcountries due to the high cost of installing and maintaining such systems. TheMyShake system takes a different approach and turns people's smartphones intoportable seismic sensors to detect earthquake-like motions. However, to issueEEW messages with high accuracy and low latency in the real world, we need toaddress a number of challenges related to mobile computing. In this paper, wefirst summarize our experience building and deploying the MyShake system, thenfocus on two key challenges for smartphone-based EEW (sensing heterogeneity anduser/system dynamics) and some preliminary exploration. We also discuss otherchallenges and new research directions associated with smartphone-based seismicnetwork.

Broadband Photovoltaic Detectors based on an Atomically Thin  Heterostructure

  Van der Waals junctions of two-dimensional materials with an atomically sharpinterface open up unprecedented opportunities to design and study functionalheterostructures. Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides have showntremendous potential for future applications due to their unique electronicproperties and strong light-matter interaction. However, many importantoptoelectronic applications, such as broadband photodetection, are severelyhindered by their limited spectral range and reduced light absorption. Here, wepresent a p-g-n heterostructure formed by sandwiching graphene with a gaplessbandstructure and wide absorption spectrum in an atomically thin p-n junctionto overcome these major limitations. We have successfully demonstrated aMoS2-graphene-WSe2 heterostructure for broadband photodetection in the visibleto short-wavelength infrared range at room temperature that exhibitscompetitive device performance, including a specific detectivity of up to 1011Jones in the near-infrared region. Our results pave the way toward theimplementation of atomically thin heterostructures for broadband and sensitiveoptoelectronic applications.

Investigating Factors Influencing the Latency of Cyberbullying Detection

  Cyberbullying in online social networks has become a critical problem,especially among teenagers who are social networks' prolific users. As aresult, researchers have focused on identifying distinguishing features ofcyberbullying and developing techniques to automatically detect cyberbullyingincidents. While this research has resulted in developing highly accurateclassifiers, two key practical issues related to identifying cyberbullying havelargely been ignored, namely scalability of cyberbullying detection servicesand timeliness of raising alerts whenever a cyberbullying incident issuspected.  These two issues are the subject of this paper. We propose a multi-stagecyberbullying detection solution that drastically reduces the classificationtime and the time to raise cyberbullying alerts. The proposed solution ishighly scalable, does not sacrifice accuracy for scalability, and is highlyresponsive in raising alerts. The solution is comprised of three novelcomponents, an initial predictor, a multilevel priority scheduler, and anincremental classification mechanism. We have implemented this solution andutilized data obtained from the Vine online social network to demonstrate theutility of each of these components via a detailed performance evaluation. Weshow that our complete solution is significantly more scalable and responsivethan the current state-of-the-art.

MFDL: A Multicarrier Fresnel Penetration Model based Device-Free  Localization System leveraging Commodity Wi-Fi Cards

  Device-free localization plays an important role in many ubiquitousapplications. Among the different technologies proposed, Wi-Fi based technologyusing commercial devices has attracted much attention due to its low cost, easeof deployment, and high potential for accurate localization. Existing solutionsuse either fingerprints that require labor-intensive radio-map survey andupdates, or models constructed from empirical studies with dense deployment ofWi-Fi transceivers. In this work, we explore the Fresnel Zone Theory in physicsand propose a generic Fresnel Penetration Model (FPM), which reveals the linearrelationship between specific Fresnel zones and multicarrier Fresnel phasedifference, along with the Fresnel phase offset caused by static multipathenvironments. We validate FPM in both outdoor and complex indoor environments.Furthermore, we design a multicarrier FPM based device-free localization system(MFDL), which overcomes a number of practical challenges, particularly theFresnel phase difference estimation and phase offset calibration inmultipath-rich indoor environments. Extensive experimental results show thatcompared with the state-of-the-art work (LiFS), our MFDL system achieves betterlocalization accuracy with much fewer number of Wi-Fi transceivers.Specifically, using only three transceivers, the median localization error ofMFDL is as low as 45$cm$ in an outdoor environment of 36$m^2$, and 55$cm$ inindoor settings of 25$m^2$. Increasing the number of transceivers to fourallows us to achieve 75$cm$ median localization error in a 72$m^2$ indoor area,compared with the 1.1$m$ median localization error achieved by LiFS using 11transceivers in a 70$m^2$ area.

GEVR: An Event Venue Recommendation System for Groups of Mobile Users

  In this paper, we present GEVR, the first Group Event Venue Recommendationsystem that incorporates mobility via individual location traces and contextinformation into a "social-based" group decision model to provide venuerecommendations for groups of mobile users. Our study leverages a real-worlddataset collected using the OutWithFriendz mobile app for group event planning,which contains 625 users and over 500 group events. We first develop a novel"social-based" group location prediction model, which adaptively appliesdifferent group decision strategies to groups with different socialrelationship strength to aggregate each group member's location preference, topredict where groups will meet. Evaluation results show that our predictionmodel not only outperforms commonly used and state-of-the-art group decisionstrategies with over 80% accuracy for predicting groups' final meeting locationclusters, but also provides promising qualities in cold-start scenarios. Wethen integrate our prediction model with the Foursquare Venue RecommendationAPI to construct an event venue recommendation framework for groups of mobileusers. Evaluation results show that GEVR outperforms the comparative models bya significant margin.

The Neighborhood Function and Its Application to Identifying Large-Scale  Structure in the Comoving Universe Frame

  In this paper a relative number density parameter, called the neighborhoodfunction, is introduced so that the crowded nature of the neighborhood ofindividual sources can be described. With this parameter one can determine theprobability of forming a cluster by chance. A method is proposed to identifylarge-scale structure in the cosmological comoving frame. The scale used tosort out clustered sources is determined by the mean local number density, andthe sample adopted is required to have regular borders. The method is appliedto a sample drawn from the Two Degree Field survey. We find from the analysisthat the probability of forming the resulting large-scale structures by chanceis very small, and the phenomenon of clustering is dominant in the localuniverse. Within a 3\sigma confidence level, a coherent cluster with a scale aslarge as 357h^{-1}Mpc is identified from the sample. There exist some galaxieswhich are not affected by the gravitation of clusters, and hence are suspectedto be at rest in the comoving frame of the universe. Voids are likely volumeswithin which very crowded sources are not present, and they are likely formedin embryo by fluctuations in the very early epochs of the universe. Inaddition, we find that large-scale structures are coral-like and are likelymade up of smaller structures; sources with large values of the neighborhoodfunction are mainly distributed within the structure of prominent clusters, andthey form the framework of the large-scale structure.

"This is why we play": Characterizing Online Fan Communities of the NBA  Teams

  Professional sports constitute an important part of people's modern life.People spend substantial amounts of time and money supporting their favoriteplayers and teams, and sometimes even riot after games. However, how teamperformance affects fan behavior remains understudied at a large scale. Asalmost every notable professional team has its own online fan community, thesecommunities provide great opportunities for investigating this researchquestion. In this work, we provide the first large-scale characterization ofonline fan communities of professional sports teams.  Since user behavior in these online fan communities is inherently connectedto game events and team performance, we construct a unique dataset thatcombines 1.5M posts and 43M comments in NBA-related communities on Reddit withstatistics that document team performance in the NBA. We analyze the impact ofteam performance on fan behavior both at the game level and the season level.First, we study how team performance in a game relates to user activity duringthat game. We find that surprise plays an important role: the fans of the topteams are more active when their teams lose and so are the fans of the bottomteams in an unexpected win. Second, we study fan behavior over consecutiveseasons and show that strong team performance is associated with fans of lowloyalty, likely due to "bandwagon fans." Fans of the bottom teams tend todiscuss their team's future such as young talents in the roster, which may helpthem stay optimistic during adversity. Our results not only contribute tounderstanding the interplay between online sports communities and offlinecontext but also provide significant insights into sports management.

Observation of the decay $ψ(3686)$ $\rightarrow$  $Λ\barΣ^{\pm}π^{\mp}+c.c.$

  Using a sample of $1.06\times10^{8}$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with theBESIII detector, we present the first observation of the decays of $\psi(3686)$$\rightarrow$ $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^{+}\pi^{-}+c.c.$ and $\psi(3686)$$\rightarrow$ $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^{-}\pi^{+}+c.c.$. The branching fractions aremeasured to be $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3686) \rightarrow \Lambda\bar\Sigma^{+}\pi^{-}+ c.c.)=(1.40\pm 0.03 \pm 0.13)\times10^{-4}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3686)\rightarrow \Lambda\bar\Sigma^{-}\pi^{+}+c.c.)=(1.54\pm 0.04 \pm0.13)\times10^{-4}$, where the first errors are statistical and the second onessystematic.

First results on low-mass WIMP from the CDEX-1 experiment at the China  Jinping underground Laboratory

  The China Dark matter Experiment collaboration reports the first experimentallimit on WIMP dark matter from 14.6 kg-day of data taken with a 994 g p-typepoint-contact germanium detector at the China Jinping underground Laboratorywhere the rock overburden is more than 2400 m. The energy threshold achievedwas 400 eVee. According to the 14.6 kg-day live data, we placed the limit of N=1.75 * 10^{-40} cm^{2} at 90% confidence level on the spin-independentcross-section at WIMP mass of 7 GeV before differentiating bulk signals fromthe surface backgrounds.

Limits on light WIMPs from the CDEX-1 experiment with a p-type  point-contact germanium detector at the China Jingping Underground Laboratory

  We report results of a search for light Dark Matter WIMPs with CDEX-1experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, based on 53.9 kg-daysof data from a p-type point-contact germanium detector enclosed by a NaI(Tl)crystal scintillator as anti-Compton detector. The event rate and spectrumabove the analysis threshold of 475 eVee are consistent with the understoodbackground model. Part of the allowed regions for WIMP-nucleus coherent elasticscattering at WIMP mass of 6-20 GeV are probed and excluded. Independent ofinteraction channels, this result contradicts the interpretation that theanomalous excesses of the CoGeNT experiment are induced by Dark Matter, sinceidentical detector techniques are used in both experiments.

Measurement of $η^\prime\rightarrow π^+π^- e^+e^-$ and  $η^\prime\rightarrow π^+π^-μ^+μ^-$

  Based on a sample of 225.3 million J/\psi events accumulated with the BESIIIdetector at the BEPCII, the decays of \eta' to pi+pi-l+l- are studied viaJ/\psi to \gamma\eta'. A clear \eta' signal is observed in the pi+pi-e+e- massspectrum, and the branching fraction is measured to be \BR(\eta' to pi+pi-e+e-)= (2.11\pm0.12 (stat.)\pm0.15 (syst.))\times10^{-3}, which is in good agreementwith theoretical predictions and the previous measurement, but is determinedwith much higher precision. No \eta' signal is found in the pi+ pi- mu+ mu-mass spectrum, and the upper limit is determined to be \BR(\eta' to pi+ pi- mu+mu-)<2.9\times10^{-5} at the 90% confidence level.

Measurement of the $D\to K^-π^+$ strong phase difference in  $ψ(3770)\to D^0\overline{D}{}^0$

  We study $D^0\overline{D}{}^0$ pairs produced in $e^+e^-$ collisions at$\sqrt{s}=3.773$ GeV using a data sample of 2.92 fb$^{-1}$ collected with theBESIII detector. We measure the asymmetry $\mathcal{A}^{CP}_{K\pi}$ of thebranching fractions of $D \to K^-\pi^+$ in $CP$-odd and $CP$-even eigenstatesto be $(12.7\pm1.3\pm0.7)\times10^{-2}$. $\mathcal{A}^{CP}_{K\pi}$ can be usedto extract the strong phase difference $\delta_{K\pi}$ between the doublyCabibbo-suppressed process $\overline{D}{}^{0}\to K^-\pi^+$ and theCabibbo-favored process $D^0\to K^- \pi^+$. Using world-average values ofexternal parameters, we obtain $\cos\delta_{K\pi} = 1.02\pm0.11\pm0.06\pm0.01$.Here, the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic,respectively, while the third uncertainty arises from the external parameters.This is the most precise measurement of $\delta_{K\pi}$ to date.

Measurement of the branching fraction for $ψ(3686)\toωK^+ K^-$

  With $1.06\times 10^8$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIIIdetector, the branching fraction of $\psi(3686) \to \omega K^+ K^-$ is measuredto be $(1.54 \pm 0.04 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-4}$. This is the most preciseresult to date, due to the largest $\psi(3686)$ sample, improved signalreconstruction efficiency, good simulation of the detector performance, and amore accurate knowledge of the continuum contribution. Using the branchingfraction of $J/\psi \to \omega K^+ K^-$, the ratio $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3868) \toK^+K^-) / \mathcal{B}(J/\psi \to K^+K^-)$ is determined to be $(18.4 \pm3.7)\,\%$. This constitutes a significantly improved test of the $12\,\%$ rule,with the uncertainty now dominated by the $J/\psi$ branching fraction.

Search for the radiative transitions $ψ(3770)\toγη_c$ and  $γη_c(2S)$

  By using a 2.92 fb$^{-1}$ data sample taken at $\sqrt{s} = 3.773$ GeV withthe BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, we search for theradiative transitions $\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c$ and $\gamma\eta_c(2S)$through the hadronic decays $\eta_c(\eta_c(2S))\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$. Nosignificant excess of signal events above background is observed. We set upperlimits at a 90% confidence level for the product branching fractions to be$\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c)\times \mathcal{B}(\eta_c\toK^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp) < 1.6\times10^{-5}$ and$\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c(2S))\times \mathcal{B}(\eta_c(2S)\toK^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp) < 5.6\times10^{-6}$. Combining our result with world-averagevalues of $\mathcal{B}(\eta_c(\eta_c(2S))\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp)$, we find thebranching fractions $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c) < 6.8\times10^{-4}$and $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3770)\to\gamma\eta_c(2S)) < 2.0\times10^{-3}$ at a 90%confidence level.

Observation of $J/ψ\rightarrow p\bar{p}a_{0}(980)$ at BESIII

  Using $2.25\times10^{8}$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detectorat the BEPCII storage rings, we observe for the first time the process$J/\psi\rightarrow p\bar{p}a_{0}(980)$, $a_{0}(980)\rightarrow \pi^{0}\eta$with a significance of $6.5\sigma$ ($3.2\sigma$ including systematicuncertainties). The product branching fraction of $J/\psi\rightarrowp\bar{p}a_{0}(980)\rightarrow p\bar{p}\pi^{0}\eta$ is measured to be$(6.8\pm1.2\pm1.3)\times 10^{-5}$, where the first error is statistical and thesecond is systematic. This measurement provides information on the $a_{0}$production near threshold coupling to $p\bar{p}$ and improves the understandingof the dynamics of $J/\psi$ decays to four body processes.

  Using $1.06\times10^8$ $\psi(3686)$ events recorded in $e^{+}e^{-}$collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 3.686 GeV with the BESIII at the BEPCII collider, wepresent searches for C-parity violation in $J/\psi \to \gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma \phi$ decays via $\psi(3686) \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$. No significantsignals are observed in either channel. Upper limits on the branching fractionsare set to be $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi \to \gamma\gamma) < 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and$\mathcal{B}(J/\psi \to \gamma\phi) < 1.4 \times 10^{-6}$ at the 90\%confidence level. The former is one order of magnitude more stringent than theprevious upper limit, and the latter represents the first limit on this decaychannel.

Search for $η$ and $η^\prime\to π^+ e^- \barν_e +c.c.$  decays in $\jpsi \to φη$ and $φη^\prime$

  Using a sample of 225.3 million $\jpsi$ events collected with the BESIIIdetector at the BEPCII $e^+e^-$ collider in 2009, searches for the decays of$\eta$ and $\eta^\prime\to\pi^+ e^- \bar{\nu}_e +c.c.$ in $\jpsi \to \phi \eta$and $\phi\eta^\prime$ are performed. The $\phi$ signals, which arereconstructed in $K^+K^-$ final states, are used to tag $\eta$ and$\eta^\prime$ semileptonic decays. No signals are observed for either $\eta$ or$\eta^\prime$, and upper limits at the 90% confidence level are determined tobe $7.3\times 10^{-4}$ and $5.0\times 10^{-4}$ for the ratios $\frac{{\mathcalB}(\eta\to \pi^+ e^- \bar{\nu}_e +c.c.)}{{\mathcal B}(\eta \to \pip\pim\piz)}$and $\frac{{\mathcal B}(\eta^\prime\to \pi^+ e^-\bar{\nu}_e +c.c.)}{{\mathcalB}(\eta^\prime \to \pip\pim\eta)}$, respectively. These are the first upperlimit values determined for $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ semileptonic weak decays.

Study of the near-threshold $ωφ$ mass enhancement in doubly OZI  suppressed $J/ψ\to γωφ$ decays

  A 2.25$\times10^8$ $\jpsi$ event sample accumulated with the BESIII detectoris used to study the doubly OZI suppressed decay modes $\jpsi\to\gamma\of$,$\omega\to\ppp$, $\phi\to\kk$. A strong deviation ($>$ 30$\sigma$) fromthree-body $\jpsi\to\gamma\omega\phi$ phase space is observed near the$\omega\phi$ mass threshold that is consistent with a previous observationreported by the BESII experiment. A partial wave analysis with a tensorcovariant amplitude that assumes that the enhancement is due to the presence ofa resonance, the X(1810), is performed, and confirms that the spin-parity ofthe X(1810) is $0^{++}$. The mass and width of the X(1810) are determined to be$M=1795\pm7$(stat)$^{+13}_{-5}$(syst)$\pm$19(mod) MeV/$c^2$ and$\Gamma=95\pm10$(stat)$^{+21}_{-34}$(syst)$\pm$75(mod) MeV/$c^2$, respectively,and the product branching fraction is measured to be ${\cal B}(\jpsi\to\gammaX(1810))\times{\calB}(X(1810)\to\of)=(2.00\pm0.08$(stat)$^{+0.45}_{-1.00}$(syst)$\pm$1.30(mod))$\times10^{-4}$.%where the first error is the statistical error and the second the systematicalerror. These results are consistent within errors with those of the BESIIexperiment.

  Based on a sample of $2.25\times 10^{8}$ $J/\psi$ events collected with theBESIII detector at BEPCII, a full partial wave analysis on$J/\psi\to\gamma\eta\eta$ was performed using the relativistic covariant tensoramplitude method. The results show that the dominant $0^{++}$ and $2^{++}$components are from the $f_0(1710)$, $f_0(2100)$, $f_0(1500)$, $f_2'(1525)$,$f_2(1810)$ and $f_2(2340)$.

The upper limit of the branching fraction$\mathcal{B}(J/\psi \rightarrow \omega X(p\bar{p}) \rightarrow \omega p\bar{p})$ is determined to be $3.9\times10^{-6}$ at the 95% confidence level.The branching fraction of $J/\psi \rightarrow \omega p \bar{p}$ is measured tobe $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi \rightarrow \omega p \bar{p}) =(9.0 \pm 0.2\(\text{stat.})\pm 0.9\ (\text{syst.})) \times 10^{-4}$.

Observation of a charged charmoniumlike structure in e+e- to pi+pi-J/psi  at \sqrt{s}=4.26 GeV

  We study the process e+e- to pi+pi-J/psi at a center-of-mass energy of 4.260GeV using a 525 pb^{-1} data sample collected with the BESIII detectoroperating at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. The Born cross section ismeasured to be (62.9\pm 1.9\pm 3.7) pb, consistent with the production of theY(4260). We observe a structure at around 3.9 GeV/c^2 in the \pi^\pm J/psi massspectrum, which we refer to as the Z_c(3900). If interpreted as a new particle,it is unusual in that it carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium.A fit to the \pi^\pm J/psi invariant mass spectrum, neglecting interference,results in a mass of (3899.0\pm 3.6\pm 4.9) MeV/c^2 and a width of (46\pm 10\pm20) MeV. Its production ratio is measured to be R=\frac{\sigma(e+e- to \pi^\pmZ_c(3900)^\mp to pi+pi-J/psi))} {\sigma(e+e- to pi+pi-J/psi)}=(21.5\pm 3.3\pm7.5)%. In all measurements the first errors are statistical and the second aresystematic.

  Using a sample of $1.06 \times 10^{8}$ $\psi(2S)$ events collected with theBESIII detector at BEPCII, the decay $\psi(2S) \to p \bar{p}\eta$ is studied.
