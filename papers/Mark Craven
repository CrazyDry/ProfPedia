Learning Hidden Markov Models for Regression using Path Aggregation

  We consider the task of learning mappings from sequential data to real-valuedresponses. We present and evaluate an approach to learning a type of hiddenMarkov model (HMM) for regression. The learning process involves inferring thestructure and parameters of a conventional HMM, while simultaneously learning aregression model that maps features that characterize paths through the modelto continuous responses. Our results, in both synthetic and biological domains,demonstrate the value of jointly learning the two components of our approach.

Understanding Learned Models by Identifying Important Features at the  Right Resolution

  In many application domains, it is important to characterize how complexlearned models make their decisions across the distribution of instances. Oneway to do this is to identify the features and interactions among them thatcontribute to a model's predictive accuracy. We present a model-agnosticapproach to this task that makes the following specific contributions. Ourapproach (i) tests feature groups, in addition to base features, and tries todetermine the level of resolution at which important features can bedetermined, (ii) uses hypothesis testing to rigorously assess the effect ofeach feature on the model's loss, (iii) employs a hierarchical approach tocontrol the false discovery rate when testing feature groups and individualbase features for importance, and (iv) uses hypothesis testing to identifyimportant interactions among features and feature groups. We evaluate ourapproach by analyzing random forest and LSTM neural network models learned intwo challenging biomedical applications.

CASTER - a concept for a Black Hole Finder Probe based on the use of new  scintillator technologies

  The primary scientific mission of the Black Hole Finder Probe (BHFP), part ofthe NASA Beyond Einstein program, is to survey the local Universe for blackholes over a wide range of mass and accretion rate. One approach to such asurvey is a hard X-ray coded-aperture imaging mission operating in the 10--600keV energy band, a spectral range that is considered to be especially useful inthe detection of black hole sources. The development of new inorganicscintillator materials provides improved performance (for example, with regardsto energy resolution and timing) that is well suited to the BHFP sciencerequirements. Detection planes formed with these materials coupled with a newgeneration of readout devices represent a major advancement in the performancecapabilities of scintillator-based gamma cameras. Here, we discuss the CodedAperture Survey Telescope for Energetic Radiation (CASTER), a concept thatrepresents a BHFP based on the use of the latest scintillator technology.

Solar System Ice Giants: Exoplanets in our Backyard

  Future remote sensing of exoplanets will be enhanced by a thoroughinvestigation of our solar system Ice Giants (Neptune-size planets). What canthe configuration of the magnetic field tell us (remotely) about the interior,and what implications does that field have for the structure of themagnetosphere; energy input into the atmosphere, and surface geophysics (forexample surface weathering of satellites that might harbour sub-surfaceoceans). How can monitoring of auroral emission help inform future remoteobservations of emission from exoplanets? Our Solar System provides the onlylaboratory in which we can perform in-situ experiments to understand exoplanetformation, dynamos, systems and magnetospheres.
