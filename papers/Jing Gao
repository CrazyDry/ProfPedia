  We construct a vertex representation for the quantum toroidal algebra throughthe quantum general linear algebra. Using a new realization of the quantumgeneral linear algebra we construct vertex operators for root vectors on thebasic representation of the affine Lie algebra $gl_n$ and show that the simplegenerators give rise a realization of the quantum toroidal algebra with twoparameters.

A quantized Tits-Kantor-Koecher algebra

  We propose a quantum analogue of a Tits-Kantor-Koecher algebra with a Jordantorus as an coordinated algebra by looking at the vertex operator constructionover a Fock space.

On multi-variable Zassenhaus formula

  In this paper, we give a recursive algorithm to compute the multivariableZassenhaus formula $$e^{X_1+X_2+\cdots +X_n}=e^{X_1}e^{X_2}\cdotse^{X_n}\prod_{k=2}^{\infty}e^{W_k}$$ and derive an effective recursion formulaof $W_k$.

Asymptotic solvers for ordinary differential equations with multiple  frequencies

  We construct asymptotic expansions for ordinary differential equations withhighly oscillatory forcing terms, focussing on the case of multiple,non-commensurate frequencies. We derive an asymptotic expansion in inversepowers of the oscillatory parameter and use its truncation as an exceedinglyeffective means to discretize the differential equation in question. Numericalexamples illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

Phase-sensitive Manipulations of Squeezed Vacuum Field in an Optical  Parametric Amplifier inside an Optical Cavity

  Squeezed vacuum field can be amplified or deamplified when it is injected, asthe signal beam, into a phase-sensitive optical parametric amplifier (OPA)inside an optical cavity. The spectral features of the reflected quantizedsignal field are controlled by the relative phase between the injected squeezedvacuum field and the pump field for the OPA. The experimental resultsdemonstrate coherent phenomena of OPA in the quantum regime, and showphase-sensitive manipulations of quantum fluctuations for quantum informationprocessing.

Twisted vertex operators and unitary Lie algebras

  A representation of the central extension of the unitary Lie algebracoordinated with a skew Laurent polynomial ring is constructed using vertexoperators over an integral Z_2-lattice. The irreducible decomposition of therepresentation is explicitly computed and described. As a by-product, somefundamental representations of affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra of type $A_n^{(2)}$are recovered by the new method.

Rota-Baxter operators on Witt and Virasoro algebras

  The homogeneous Rota-Baxter operators on the Witt and Virasoro algebras areclassified. As applications, the induced solutions of the classical Yang-Baxterequation and the induced pre-Lie and PostLie algebra structures are obtained.

Topic Memory Networks for Short Text Classification

  Many classification models work poorly on short texts due to data sparsity.To address this issue, we propose topic memory networks for short textclassification with a novel topic memory mechanism to encode latent topicrepresentations indicative of class labels. Different from most prior work thatfocuses on extending features with external knowledge or pre-trained topics,our model jointly explores topic inference and text classification with memorynetworks in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on four benchmarkdatasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on short textclassification, meanwhile generates coherent topics.

What You Say and How You Say it: Joint Modeling of Topics and Discourse  in Microblog Conversations

  This paper presents an unsupervised framework for jointly modeling topiccontent and discourse behavior in microblog conversations. Concretely, wepropose a neural model to discover word clusters indicating what a conversationconcerns (i.e., topics) and those reflecting how participants voice theiropinions (i.e., discourse). Extensive experiments show that our model can yieldboth coherent topics and meaningful discourse behavior. Further study showsthat our topic and discourse representations can benefit the classification ofmicroblog messages, especially when they are jointly trained with theclassifier.

Copper Replaces Tin: A Copper based Gelling Catalyst for Poly-Urethane  from Discarded Motherboard

  A discarded motherboard based eco-friendly copper catalyst has beenprogrammed to replace the industrially used tin based catalyst DBTDL. Thecatalyst has been characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR and TEM. Usingthe catalyst reaction conditions is optimized and under the optimizedcondition, both polyurethane and polyurethane foam are prepared, thus provingthe generality of the catalyst to be used in industries. A possible mechanismhas also been proposed.

An Iterative Minimization Formulation for Saddle-Point Search

  This paper proposes and analyzes an iterative minimization formulation forsearch- ing index-1 saddle points of an energy function. This formulationdiffers from other eigenvector-following methods by constructing a newobjective function near the guess at each iteration step. This leads to aquadratic convergence rate, in comparison to the linear case of the gentlestascent dynamics (E and Zhou, nonlinearity, vol 24, p1831, 2011) and many otherexisting methods. We also propose the generalization of the new methodology forsaddle points of higher index and for constrained energy functions on manifold.

Fiber-based ultra-stable frequency synchronization using client-side,  1f-2f active compensation method

  We demonstrate a frequency synchronization scheme with the phase noisecompensation function placed at the client site. One transmitting module hencecan be linked with multiple client sites. As a performance test, using twoseparate 50 km fiber spools, we recover the 100 MHz disseminated referencefrequencies at two remote sites, separately. Relative frequency stabilitiesbetween two recovered frequency signals of 2.8E-14/s and 2.5E-17/day areobtained. This scalable scheme is suitable for the applications of frequencydissemination with a star-topology, such as SKA and DSN.

Phase diagram and thermal properties of strong-interaction matter

  We introduce a novel procedure for computing the (mu,T)-dependent pressure incontinuum QCD; and therefrom obtain a complex phase diagram and predictions forthermal properties of the system, providing the in-medium behaviour of thetrace anomaly, speed of sound, latent heat and heat capacity.

All-optical transistor based on Rydberg atom-assisted opto-mechanical  system

  We study the optical response of double optomechanical cavity system assistedby Rydberg atomic ensembles. And atomic ensembles are only coupled with oneside cavity by a single cavity mode. It has been realized that a long-rangemanipulation for optical properties of hybrid system, by controlling theRydberg atomic ensembles decoupled with the optomechanical cavity. Switching onthe coupling between atoms and cavity mode, the original time reversal symmetryof double cavity structure has been broken. Based on the controlled opticalnon-reciprocity, we put forward the theoretical schemes of all-opticalcontrolled diode, rectifier and transistor.

Unsupervised Deep Structured Semantic Models for Commonsense Reasoning

  Commonsense reasoning is fundamental to natural language understanding. Whiletraditional methods rely heavily on human-crafted features and knowledge bases,we explore learning commonsense knowledge from a large amount of raw text viaunsupervised learning. We propose two neural network models based on the DeepStructured Semantic Models (DSSM) framework to tackle two classic commonsensereasoning tasks, Winograd Schema challenges (WSC) and Pronoun Disambiguation(PDP). Evaluation shows that the proposed models effectively capture contextualinformation in the sentence and co-reference information between pronouns andnouns, and achieve significant improvement over previous state-of-the-artapproaches.

Interface Ferromagnetism in (110)-Oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3  Ultrathin Superlattices

  We explore manganite interface magnetism in epitaxially grownLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3(LSMO)/SrTiO3 ultrathin superlattices (SL) along (110)orientation. we show that robust ferromagnetism persists down to fourmonolayers LSMO(MLs) (~1.1 nm in thickness), of which 50% Mn is at theinterface state. Above eight MLs, the magnetic moment is nearly saturated tothe theoretical value of 3.7u_B, with an estimated interface moment of 3.2u_B.In comparison to (100)-oriented SLs which were previously shown to have a spincanted ground state, (110)-oriented SLs exhibit stronger low-dimensionalferromagnetism and better metallicity, suggesting a ferromagnetic interfacespin state well suited for all-oxide spintronic devices. The underliningmechanism is qualitatively discussed.

Quantum internet using code division multiple access

  A crucial open problem in large-scale quantum networks is how to efficientlytransmit quantum data among many pairs of users via a common data-transmissionmedium. We propose a solution by developing a quantum code division multipleaccess (q-CDMA) approach in which quantum information is chaotically encoded tospread its spectral content, and then decoded via chaos synchronization toseparate different sender-receiver pairs. In comparison to other existingapproaches, such as frequency division multiple access (FDMA), the proposedq-CDMA can greatly increase the information rates per channel used, especiallyfor very noisy quantum channels.

The role of 245 phase in alkaline iron selenide superconductors revealed  by high pressure studies

  Here we show that a pressure of about 8 GPa suppresses both the vacancy orderand the insulating phase, and a further increase of the pressure to about 18GPa induces a second transition or crossover. No superconductivity has beenfound in compressed insulating 245 phase. The metallic phase in theintermediate pressure range has a distinct behavior in the transport property,which is also observed in the superconducting sample. We interpret thisintermediate metal as an orbital selective Mott phase (OSMP). Our resultssuggest that the OSMP provides the physical pathway connecting the insulatingand superconducting phases of these iron selenide materials.

Half-Metallic Silicene and Germanene Nanoribbons: towards  High-Performance Spintronics Device

  By using first-principles calculations, we predict that an in-planehomogenous electrical field can induce half-metallicity in hydrogen-terminatedzigzag silicene and germanene nanoribbons (ZSiNRs and ZGeNRs). A dual-gatedfinite ZSiNR device reveals a nearly perfect spin-filter efficiency of up to99% while a quadruple-gated finite ZSiNR device serves as an effective spinfield effect transistor (FET) with an on/off current ratio of over 100 from abinitio quantum transport simulation. This discovery opens up novel prospect ofsilicene and germanene in spintronics.

Liquid Metal Flow Can Be One Clue to Explain the Frequently Observed  Fluid-Like Matters on Mars

  The frequently discovered flooding structure on Mars and other planets haslong been an intriguing mystery remained un-disclosed so far. Considering thaton Earth, quite a few low melting point liquid metals or their alloy can becandidates of fluid like matters, we proposed here that there might also existscertain liquid metal instead of water or methane alone on Mars or the likeplanets. Compared with water, such liquid metal would be much easier to stay atthe Mars surface because of its low melting point however extremely highevaporation point. Along this theoretical route, quite a few observations onthe fluid like matters in former space explorations can be well interpreted.Such hypothesis for the existence of liquid metal on Mars surface does not meanrefuting the possibility of water on Mars. This new point would be helpful forplanning further exploration of Mars in a sense according to the characters ofliquid metal. It at least identifies one more target fluid towards eitherfinding or denying life at outer space. Whether the planet could harbor life insome form or it reaffirms Mars as an important future destination for humanexploration still needs serious but not just enthusiasm explorations.

Robust antiferromagnetism preventing superconductivity in pressurized  Ba0.61K0.39Mn2Bi2

  Here, we report that K-doped BaMn2Bi2 shows no experimental evidence ofsuperconductivity down to 1.5 K under pressures up to 35.6 GPa, however, atetragonal to an orthorhombic phase transition is observed at pressure of 20GPa. Theoretical calculations for the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, onbasis of our high-pressure XRD data, find that the AFM order is robust in bothof the phases in pressurized Ba0.61K0.39Mn2Bi2. Our experimental andtheoretical results suggest that the K-doped BaMn2Bi2 belongs to a strong HundsAFM metal with a hybridization of localized spin electrons and itinerantelectrons, and that its robust AFM order essentially prevents the emergence ofsuperconductivity.

Semi-coherent Detection and Performance Analysis for Ambient Backscatter  System

  We study a novel communication mechanism, ambient backscatter, that utilizesradio frequency (RF) signals transmitted from an ambient source as both energysupply and information carrier to enable communications between low-powerdevices. Different from existing non-coherent schemes, we here design thesemi-coherent detection, where channel parameters can be obtained from unknowndata symbols and a few pilot symbols. We first derive the optimal detector forthe complex Gaussian ambient RF signal from likelihood ratio test and computethe corresponding closed-form bit error rate (BER). To release the requirementfor prior knowledge of the ambient RF signal, we next design a suboptimalenergy detector with ambient RF signals being either the complex Gaussian orthe phase shift keying (PSK). The corresponding detection thresholds, theanalytical BER, and the outage probability are also obtained in closed-form.Interestingly, the complex Gaussian source would cause an error floor while thePSK source does not, which brings nontrivial indication of constellation designas opposed to the popular Gaussian-embedded literatures. Simulations areprovided to corroborate the theoretical studies.

Long-Term Memory Networks for Question Answering

  Question answering is an important and difficult task in the natural languageprocessing domain, because many basic natural language processing tasks can becast into a question answering task. Several deep neural network architectureshave been developed recently, which employ memory and inference components tomemorize and reason over text information, and generate answers to questions.However, a major drawback of many such models is that they are capable of onlygenerating single-word answers. In addition, they require large amount oftraining data to generate accurate answers. In this paper, we introduce theLong-Term Memory Network (LTMN), which incorporates both an external memorymodule and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to comprehend the input dataand generate multi-word answers. The LTMN model can be trained end-to-end usingback-propagation and requires minimal supervision. We test our model on twosynthetic data sets (based on Facebook's bAbI data set) and the real-worldStanford question answering data set, and show that it can achievestate-of-the-art performance.

Orbital Angular Momentum for Wireless Communications

  As the traditional resources (frequency, time, space, etc.) are efficientlyutilized, it becomes more and more challenging to satisfy the ever-lastingcapacity-growing and users-boosting demand in wireless networks. Recently, theelectromagnetic (EM) wave was found to possess not only linear momentum, butalso angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a kind ofwavefront with helical phase. The OAM-based vortex wave has differenttopological charges, which are orthogonal to each other, bridging a new way formultiple access in wireless communications. In this article, we introduce thefundamental theory of OAM and the OAM based wireless communications. Theresearch challenges regarding OAM signal generation, OAM beam converging, andOAM signal reception are discussed. Further, we propose a new multiuser accesswith different OAM-modes in wireless networks, where multiple OAM-modes areused as a new orthogonal dimension for interference avoidance. Simulationresults reveal the inherent property of OAM waves and show that OAM based radiotransmission can significantly increase the spectrum efficiency in wirelessnetworks.

The dark matter deficit galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations

  Low mass galaxies are expected to be dark matter dominated even within theircentrals. Recently two observations reported two dwarf galaxies in groupenvironment with very little dark matter in their centrals. We explore thepopulation and origins of dark matter deficit galaxies (DMDGs) in twostate-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, the EAGLE and Illustris projects.For all satellite galaxies with $M_*>10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ in groups with$M_{200}>10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$, we find that about $5.0\%$ of them in the EAGLE,and $3.2\%$ in the Illustris are DMDGs with dark matter fractions below $50\%$inside two times half-stellar-mass radii. We demonstrate that DMDGs are highlytidal disrupted galaxies; and because dark matter has higher binding energythan stars, mass loss of the dark matter is much more rapid than stars in DMDGsduring tidal interactions. If DMDGs were confirmed in observations, they areexpected in current galaxy formation models.

Clustering-Based Codebook Design for MIMO Communication System

  Codebook design is one of the core technologies in limited feedbackmulti-input multi-output (MIMO) communication systems. However, theconventional codebook designs usually assume MIMO vectors are uniformlydistributed or isotropic. Motivated by the excellent classfication and analysisability of clustering algorithms, we propose a K-means clustering basedcodebook design. First, large amounts of channel state information (CSI) isstored as the input data of the clustering, and finally divided into N clustersaccording to the minimal distance. The clustering centroids are used as thestatistic channel information of the codebook construction which the sumdistance is minimal to the real channel information. Simulation results consistwith theoretical analysis in terms of the achievable rate, and demonstrate thatthe proposed codebook design outperforms conventional schemes, especially inthe non-uniform distribution of channel scenarios.

Online charge calibration of LHAASO-WCDA---a study with the engineering  array

  LHAASO-WCDA is a large ground-based water Cherenkov detector array planned tobe built at Shangri-La, Yunnan Province, China. As a major component of LHAASOproject, the main purpose of LHAASO-WCDA is to survey the northern sky forvery-high-energy (above 100 GeV) gamma ray sources. To gain full knowledge ofwater Cherenkov technique and to well investigate engineering issues, a 9-celldetector array has been built at Yang-Ba-Jing site, neighboring to the ARGO-YBJexperiment. With the array, charge calibration methods for low and high rangesof the PMT readout are studied, whose result shows that a very high precisionat several percentages can be reached. These calibration methods are proposedto be applied in the future LHAASO-WCDA project.

Wavelength Spacing Tunable, Multiwavelength Q-Switched Mode-Locked Laser  Based on Graphene-Oxide-Deposited Tapered Fiber

  A wavelength spacing tunable, multiwavelength Q-switched mode-locked (QML)fiber laser in an erbium-doped fiber cavity based on graphene oxide depositedon tapered fiber is proposed by choosing the diameter and length of the taper,graphene oxide thickness and cavity dispersion, in which the wavelength spacingcould be tuned by pump power. The evolutions of temporal and spectral withdifferent pump strengths are investigated. Results show that the tunability ofthe multiwavelength laser can be interpreted by the bound states of QML laserresulting from a mutual interaction of dispersion, nonlinear effect, insertionloss, and pump power. To the best of our knowledge, it is the firstexperimental observation of bound states of QML, which provides a new mechanismto fabricate tunable multiwavelength laser.

Vector rectangular-shape laser based on reduced graphene oxide  interacting with long fiber taper

  A vector dual-wavelength rectangular-shape laser (RSL) based on a long fibertaper deposited with reduced graphene oxide is proposed, where the nonlinearityis enhanced due to large evanescent-field-interacting length and strong fieldconfinement of a 8 mm fiber taper with a waist diameter of 4 micronmeters.Graphene flakes are deposited uniformly on the taper waist with light pressureeffect, so this structure guarantees both excellent saturable absorption andhigh nonlinearity. The RSL with a repetition rate of 7.9 MHz exhibits fastpolarization switching in two orthogonal polarization directions, and thetemporal and spectral characteristics are investigated. The results suggestthat the long taper-based graphene structure is an efficient choice fornonlinear devices.

A Polynomial-time Algorithm to Compute Generalized Hermite Normal Form  of Matrices over Z[x]

  In this paper, a polynomial-time algorithm is given to compute thegeneralized Hermite normal form for a matrix F over Z[x], or equivalently, thereduced Groebner basis of the Z[x]-module generated by the column vectors of F.The algorithm is also shown to be practically more efficient than existingalgorithms. The algorithm is based on three key ingredients. First, an F4 stylealgorithm to compute the Groebner basis is adopted, where a novel prolongationis designed such that the coefficient matrices under consideration havepolynomial sizes. Second, fast algorithms to compute Hermite normal forms ofmatrices over Z are used. Third, the complexity of the algorithm are guaranteedby a nice estimation for the degree and height bounds of the polynomials in thegeneralized Hermite normal form.

The dependence of dark halo clustering on the formation epoch and the  concentration parameter

  We examine the age-dependence of dark matter halo clustering in anunprecedented accuracy using a set of 7 high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations each with $N=1024^3$ particles. We measure the bias parameters forhalos over a large mass range using the cross-power-spectrum method that caneffectively suppress the random noise even in the sparse sampling of the mostmassive halos. This enables us to find, for the first time, that younger halosare more strongly clustered than older ones for halo masses $M>10M_{\ast}$,where $M_\ast$ is the characteristic nonlinear mass scale. For $M<M_{\ast}$,our results confirm the previous finding of Gao et al. that older halos areclustered more strongly than the younger ones. We also study the halo bias as afunction of halo concentration, and find that the concentration dependence isweaker than the age dependence for $M<M_{\ast}$, but stronger for $M\ga 50M_{\ast}$. The accurate and robust measurement of the age dependences of halobias points to a limitation of the simple excursion set theory which predictsthat the formation and structure of a halo of given mass is independent of itsenvironment.

An Algorithm for Preferential Selection of Spectroscopic Targets in  LEGUE

  We describe a general target selection algorithm that is applicable to anysurvey in which the number of available candidates is much larger than thenumber of objects to be observed. This routine aims to achieve a balancebetween a smoothly-varying, well-understood selection function and the desireto preferentially select certain types of targets. Some target-selectionexamples are shown that illustrate different possibilities of emphasisfunctions. Although it is generally applicable, the algorithm was developedspecifically for the LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding andExploration (LEGUE) survey that will be carried out using the Chinese Guo ShouJing Telescope. In particular, this algorithm was designed for the portion ofLEGUE targeting the Galactic halo, in which we attempt to balance a variety ofscience goals that require stars at fainter magnitudes than can be completelysampled by LAMOST. This algorithm has been implemented for the halo portion ofthe LAMOST pilot survey, which began in October 2011.

Splashing phenomena of room temperature liquid metal droplet striking on  the pool of the same liquid under ambient air environment

  In this article, the fluid dynamics of room temperature liquid metal (RTLM)droplet impacting onto a pool of the same liquid in ambient air wasinvestigated. A series of experiments were conducted in order to disclose theinfluence of the oxidation effect on the impact dynamics. The droplet shape andimpact phenomenology were recorded with the aid of a high-speed digital camera.The impact energy stored in the splash structures was estimated via atheoretical model and several morphological parameters obtained frominstantaneous images of the splash. It was observed that the droplet shape andthe splashing morphology of RTLM were drastically different from those ofwater, so was the impact dynamics between room temperature LM pool and hightemperature LM pool. The energy analysis disclosed that the height of the jetis highly sensitive to the viscosity of the fluid, which is subjected to theoxidation effect and temperature effect simultaneously, and thus perfectlyexplained the phenomena. These basic findings are important for the applicationof RTLM in a series of newly emerging technologies such as liquid metal basedspray cooling, ink-jet printed electronics, interface material painting andcoating, metallurgy, and 3D packages, etc.

Atomized Spraying of Liquid Metal Droplets on Desired Substrate Surfaces  as a Generalized Way for Ubiquitous Printed Electronics

  A direct electronics printing technique through atomized spraying forpatterning room temperature liquid metal droplets on desired substrate surfacesis proposed and experimentally demonstrated for the first time. This method hasgeneralized purpose and is highly flexible and capable of fabricatingelectronic components on any desired target objects, with either flat or roughsurfaces, made of different materials, or different orientations from 1-D to3-D geometrical configurations. With a pre-designed mask, the liquid metal inkcan be directly deposited on the substrate to form various specific patternswhich lead to the rapid prototyping of electronic devices. Further, extendedprinting strategies were also suggested to illustrate the adaptability of themethod such that the natural porous structure can be adopted to offer analternative way of making transparent conductive film with an opticaltransmittance of 47% and a sheet resistance of 5.167{\Omega}/O. Different fromthe former direct writing technology where large surface tension and pooradhesion between the liquid metal and the substrate often impede the flexibleprinting process, the liquid metal here no longer needs to be pre-oxidized toguarantee its applicability on target substrates. One critical mechanism wasfound as that the atomized liquid metal microdroplets can be quickly oxidizedin the air due to its large specific surface area, resulting in a significantincrease of the adhesive capacity and thus firm deposition of the ink to thesubstrate. This study established a generalized way for pervasively anddirectly printing electronics on various substrates which are expected to besignificant in a wide spectrum of electrical engineering areas.

Breakdown of Three-dimensional Dirac Semimetal State in pressurized  Cd3As2

  We report the first observation of a pressure-induced breakdown of the 3D-DSMstate in Cd3As2, evidenced by a series of in-situ high-pressure synchrotronX-ray diffraction (XRD) and single crystal transport measurements. We find thatCd3As2 undergoes a structural phase transition from a metallic tetragonal (T)phase in space group I41/acd to a semiconducting monoclinic (M) phase in spacegroup P21/c at critical pressure 2.57 GPa, above this pressure, an activationenergy gap appears, accompanied by distinct switches in Hall resistivity slopeand electron mobility. These changes of crystal symmetry and correspondingtransport properties manifest the breakdown of the 3D-DSM state in pressurizedCd3As2.

Dipole: Diagnosis Prediction in Healthcare via Attention-based  Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks

  Predicting the future health information of patients from the historicalElectronic Health Records (EHR) is a core research task in the development ofpersonalized healthcare. Patient EHR data consist of sequences of visits overtime, where each visit contains multiple medical codes, including diagnosis,medication, and procedure codes. The most important challenges for this taskare to model the temporality and high dimensionality of sequential EHR data andto interpret the prediction results. Existing work solves this problem byemploying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and utilizingsimple attention mechanism to interpret the results. However, RNN-basedapproaches suffer from the problem that the performance of RNNs drops when thelength of sequences is large, and the relationships between subsequent visitsare ignored by current RNN-based approaches. To address these issues, wepropose {\sf Dipole}, an end-to-end, simple and robust model for predictingpatients' future health information. Dipole employs bidirectional recurrentneural networks to remember all the information of both the past visits and thefuture visits, and it introduces three attention mechanisms to measure therelationships of different visits for the prediction. With the attentionmechanisms, Dipole can interpret the prediction results effectively. Dipolealso allows us to interpret the learned medical code representations which areconfirmed positively by medical experts. Experimental results on two real worldEHR datasets show that the proposed Dipole can significantly improve theprediction accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art diagnosis predictionapproaches and provide clinically meaningful interpretation.

The site conditions of the Guo Shou Jing Telescope

  The weather at Xinglong Observing Station, where the Guo Shou Jing Telescope(GSJT) is located, is strongly affected by the monsoon climate in north-eastChina. The LAMOST survey strategy is constrained by these weather patterns. Inthis paper, we present a statistics on observing hours from 2004 to 2007, andthe sky brightness, seeing, and sky transparency from 1995 to 2011 at the site.We investigate effects of the site conditions on the survey plan. Operablehours each month shows strong correlation with season: on average there are 8operable hours per night available in December, but only 1-2 hours in July andAugust. The seeing and the sky transparency also vary with seasons. Althoughthe seeing is worse in windy winters, and the atmospheric extinction is worsein the spring and summer, the site is adequate for the proposed scientificprogram of LAMOST survey. With a Monte Carlo simulation using historical dataon the site condition, we find that the available observation hours constrainthe survey footprint from 22h to 16h in right ascension; the sky brightnessallows LAMOST to obtain the limit magnitude of V = 19.5mag with S/N = 10.

Multiple graph regularized protein domain ranking

  Background Protein domain ranking is a fundamental task in structuralbiology. Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison ofprotein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the proteindomain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the globalstructure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.However, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive tothe choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficultproblem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graphregularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph toregularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifoldof protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for theregularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly andautomatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in aniterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOPprotein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better rankingperformance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwisesimilarity based ranking methods.  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graphregularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combiningmultiple graphs. This aspect of generalization introduces a new frontier inapplying multiple graphs to solving protein domain ranking applications.

Sign patterns with minimum rank 3 and point-line configurations

  A \emph{sign pattern (matrix)} is a matrix whose entries are from the set$\{+, -, 0\}$. The \emph{minimum rank} (respectively, \emph{rational minimumrank}) of a sign pattern matrix $\cal A$ is the minimum of the ranks of thereal (respectively, rational) matrices whose entries have signs equal to thecorresponding entries of $\cal A$. A sign pattern $\cal A$ is said to be\emph{condensed} if $\cal A$ has no zero row or column and no two rows orcolumns are identical or negatives of each other. In this paper, a new directconnection between condensed $m \times n $ sign patterns with minimum rank $r$and $m$ point--$n$ hyperplane configurations in ${\mathbb R}^{r-1}$ isestablished. In particular, condensed sign patterns with minimum rank 3 areclosed related to point--line configurations on the plane. It is proved thatfor any sign pattern $\cal A$ with minimum rank $r\geq 3$, if the number ofzero entries on each column of $\cal A$ is at most $r-1$, then the rationalminimum rank of $\cal A$ is also $r$. Furthermore, we construct the smallestknown sign pattern whose minimum rank is 3 but whose rational minimum rank isgreater than 3.

A deep learning approach for detecting traffic accidents from social  media data

  This paper employs deep learning in detecting the traffic accident fromsocial media data. First, we thoroughly investigate the 1-year over 3 milliontweet contents in two metropolitan areas: Northern Virginia and New York City.Our results show that paired tokens can capture the association rules inherentin the accident-related tweets and further increase the accuracy of the trafficaccident detection. Second, two deep learning methods: Deep Belief Network(DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated and implemented on theextracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracy of 85%with about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. Theclassification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and supervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA). Finally, to validatethis study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the trafficaccident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loopdetectors. It is found that nearly 66% of the accident-related tweets can belocated by the accident log and more than 80% of them can be tied to nearbyabnormal traffic data. Several important issues of using Twitter to detecttraffic accidents have been brought up by the comparison including the locationand time bias, as well as the characteristics of influential users andhashtags.

Are Great Disks Defined by Satellite Galaxies in Milky-Way Type Halos  Rare in $Λ$CDM model?

  We study the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies by assuming that theyfollow the dark matter distribution. This assumption is supported bysemi-analytical studies based on high-resolution numerical simulations. We findthat for a Milky-Way type halo, if only a dozen satellite galaxies areobserved, then they can lie on a ``great'' disk with an rms height of about 40kpc. The normal to the plane is roughly isotropic on the sky. These results areconsistent with the observed properties of the satellite galaxies in the MilkyWay. If, however, the satellite galaxies follow the distribution ofsubstructure selected by present mass, then great disks similar to the one inthe Milky Way are rare and difficult to reproduce, in agreement with theconclusion reached by Kroupa et al. (2004).

The giant arc statistics in the three year WMAP cosmological model

  We use high-resolution $N$-body simulations to investigate the optical depthof giant arcs with length-to-width ratio larger than 7.5 and 10 in the`standard' $\LCDM$ model with $\sigma_8=0.9$ and $\Omega_{\rm m,0}=0.3$ and amodel based on three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data. Wefind that, in dark-matter only simulations, the lensing probability in thethree-year WMAP model (with $\sigma_8=0.74$ and $\Omega_{\rm m,0}=0.238)$decreases by a factor of $\sim 6$ compared with that in the `standard' $\LCDM$model. The effects of baryonic cooling, star formation and feedbacks areuncertain, but we argue that baryons will only increase the the lensingcross-section by a moderate factor, $\sim 2$. We conclude that the low centralvalue of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$ preferred by the WMAP three-yeardata may be too low to be compatible with observations if conventionalassumptions of the background source population are correct.

Itinerant metamagnetism in manganites caused by the field-induced  electronic nematic order

  Itinerant metamagnetism transition is observed and studied in perovskiteLa1-xCaxMn0.90Cu0.10O3 system for x = 0.30. At a constant low temperature, 10 K< T < 150 K, there is a continuous second-order metamagnetism jump from a lowmagnetic state to a high one with the magnetic field H increasing. However, atan exceeding low temperature, T = 2.5 K, the metamagnetism jump at H = 3.5 Tbecomes to be a robust first-order transition, and another metamagnetismtransition occurs at a higher field H = 7.0 T. Since there is no chargeordering sign in the present system, it can not be understood by using thephase separation model or the prior martensite/austenitic phase transitionscenario. A theoretical electronic nematic order phase formation is evidencedto answer for the two consecutive metamagnetic transitions, which separate thenematic phase from the low-field (H < 3.5 T) and high-field (H > 7.0 T)isotropic phases.

Design of dispersive optomechanical coupling and cooling in  ultrahigh-Q/V slot-type photonic crystal cavities

  We describe the strong optomechanical dynamical interactions in ultrahigh-Q/Vslot-type photonic crystal cavities. The dispersive coupling is based on amode-gap photonic crystal cavities with light localization in an air mode with0.02(lambda/n)3 modal volumes while preserving optical cavity Q up to 5 x 106.The mechanical mode is modeled to have fundamental resonance omega_m/2pi of 460MHz and a quality factor Qm estimated at 12,000. For this slot-typeoptomechanical cavity, the dispersive coupling gom is numerically computed atup to 940 GHz/nm (Lom of 202 nm) for the fundamental optomechanical mode.Dynamical parametric oscillations for both cooling and amplification, in theresolved and unresolved sideband limit, are examined numerically, along withthe displacement spectral density and cooling rates for the various operatingparameters.

Functionalized Graphene for High Performance Two-dimensional Spintronics  Devices

  Using first-principles calculations, we explore the possibility offunctionalized graphene as high performance two-dimensional spintronics device.Graphene functionalized with O on one side and H on the other side in the chairconformation is found to be a ferromagnetic metal with a spin-filter efficiencyup to 85% at finite bias. The ground state of graphene semi-functionalized withF in the chair conformation is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and weconstruct a magnetoresistive device from it by introducing a magnetic field tostabilize its ferromagnetic metallic state. The resulting room-temperaturemagnetoresistance is up to 5400%, which is one order of magnitude larger thanthe available experimental values.

Pressure-Driven Quantum Criticality in An Iron-Selenide Superconductor

  The discovery of superconductivity of about 30 K in iron selenides with verylarge magnetic moments simulates the examination of completing orders. Here wereport a finding of pressure- induced suppression of the superconductingtransition temperature Tc and enhancement of the temperature of the resistancehump TH through charge transfer between two iron sites with differentoccupancies. The activation energy for the electric transport of thehigh-temperature resistance is observed to go to zero at a critical pressure of8.7 GPa, at which superconductivity tends to disappear and thesemiconductor-to-metal transition takes place. Beyond the critical point, theresistance exhibits a metallic behavior over the whole temperature rangestudied. All these features indicate the existence of quantum criticality iniron-selenide superconductors.

Correlation between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in  Rb0.8Fe2Se2-xTex single crystals

  We report the first experimental evidence for the intimate connection betweensuperconductivity and antiferromagnetism in Rb0.8Fe2Se2-xTex single crystalunder negative chemical pressure by substituting Se with isovalent Te atoms.Electrical resistance measurements in the temperature range from 4 K to 550 Kdemonstrate that both superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and Neeltemperature (TN) were suppressed continuously with the lattice expansion. Whenthe Te concentration x in Rb0.8Fe2Se2-xTex approaches 0.3, the superconductingtransition temperature Tc is completely suppressed and the sample behaves likea semiconductor, meanwhile the characteristic peak of antiferromagnetictransition on resistance curve disappears. Our observation suggests that thepressure-induced lattice expansion can be used to tune the correlativity ofsuperconductivity and antiferromagnetism.

Highly Quantum-Confined InAs Nanoscale Membranes

  Nanoscale size-effects drastically alter the fundamental properties ofsemiconductors. Here, we investigate the dominant role of quantum confinementin the field-effect device properties of free-standing InAs nanomembranes withvaried thicknesses of 5-50 nm. First, optical absorption studies are performedby transferring InAs "quantum membranes" (QMs) onto transparent substrates,from which the quantized sub-bands are directly visualized. These sub-bandsdetermine the contact resistance of the system with the experimental valuesconsistent with the expected number of quantum transport modes available for agiven thickness. Finally, the effective electron mobility of InAs QMs is shownto exhibit anomalous field- and thickness-dependences that are in distinctcontrast to the conventional MOSFET models, arising from the strong quantumconfinement of carriers. The results provide an important advance towardsestablishing the fundamental device physics of 2-D semiconductors.

Culturomics meets random fractal theory: Insights into long-range  correlations of social and natural phenomena over the past two centuries

  Culturomics was recently introduced as the application of high-throughputdata collection and analysis to the study of human culture. Here we make use ofthis data by investigating fluctuations in yearly usage frequencies of specificwords that describe social and natural phenomena, as derived from books thatwere published over the course of the past two centuries. We show that thedetermination of the Hurst parameter by means of fractal analysis providesfundamental insights into the nature of long-range correlations contained inthe culturomic trajectories, and by doing so, offers new interpretations as towhat might be the main driving forces behind the examined phenomena. Quiteremarkably, we find that social and natural phenomena are governed byfundamentally different processes. While natural phenomena have properties thatare typical for processes with persistent long-range correlations, socialphenomena are better described as nonstationary, on-off intermittent, or Levywalk processes.

Interfacial Properties of Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene on Metal  Substrates

  One popular approach to prepare graphene is to grow them on transition metalsubstrates via chemical vapor deposition. By using the density functionaltheory with dispersion correction, we systematically investigate for the firsttime the interfacial properties of bilayer (BLG) and trilayer graphene (TLG) onmetal substrates. Three categories of interfacial structures are revealed. Theadsorption of B(T)LG on Al, Ag, Cu, Au, and Pt substrates is a weakphysisorption, but a band gap can be opened. The adsorption of B(T)LG on Ti,Ni, and Co substrates is a strong chemisorption, and a stacking-insensitiveband gap is opened for the two uncontacted layers of TLG. The adsorption ofB(T)LG on Pd substrate is a weaker chemisorption, with a band gap opened forthe uncontacted layers. This fundamental study also helps for B(T)LG devicestudy due to inevitable graphene/metal contact.
