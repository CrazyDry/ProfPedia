Attacks on Local Searching Tools

  The Google Desktop Search is an indexing tool, currently in beta testing,designed to allow users fast, intuitive, searching for local files. Theprinciple interface is provided through a local web server which supports aninterface similar to Google.com's normal web page. Indexing of local filesoccurs when the system is idle, and understands a number of common file types.A optional feature is that Google Desktop can integrate a short summary of alocal search results with Google.com web searches. This summary includes 30-40character snippets of local files. We have uncovered a vulnerability that wouldrelease private local data to an unauthorized remote entity. Using twodifferent attacks, we expose the small snippets of private local data to aremote third party.

First Science with SAMI: A Serendipitously Discovered Galactic Wind in  ESO 185-G031

  We present the first scientific results from the Sydney-AAO Multi-Object IFS(SAMI) at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This unique instrument deploys 13fused fibre bundles (hexabundles) across a one-degree field of view allowingsimultaneous spatially-resolved spectroscopy of 13 galaxies. During the firstSAMI commissioning run, targeting a single galaxy field, one object (ESO185-G031) was found to have extended minor axis emission with ionisation andkinematic properties consistent with a large-scale galactic wind. Theimportance of this result is two-fold: (i) fibre bundle spectrographs are ableto identify low-surface brightness emission arising from extranuclear activity;(ii) such activity may be more common than presently assumed becauseconventional multi-object spectrographs use single-aperture fibres and spectrafrom these are nearly always dominated by nuclear emission. These early resultsdemonstrate the extraordinary potential of multi-object hexabundle spectroscopyin future galaxy surveys.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Unveiling the nature of kinematically offset  active galactic nuclei

  We have observed two kinematically offset active galactic nuclei (AGN), whoseionised gas is at a different line-of-sight velocity to their host galaxies,with the SAMI integral field spectrograph (IFS). One of the galaxies shows gaskinematics very different to the stellar kinematics, indicating a recent mergeror accretion event. We demonstrate that the star formation associated with thisevent was triggered within the last 100 Myr. The other galaxy shows simple discrotation in both gas and stellar kinematics, aligned with each other, but inthe central region has signatures of an outflow driven by the AGN. Other thanthe outflow, neither galaxy shows any discontinuity in the ionised gaskinematics at the galaxy's centre. We conclude that in these two cases there isno direct evidence of the AGN being in a supermassive black hole binary system.Our study demonstrates that selecting kinematically offset AGN fromsingle-fibre spectroscopy provides, by definition, samples of kinematicallypeculiar objects, but IFS or other data are required to determine their truenature.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Can we trust aperture corrections to predict  star formation?

  In the low redshift Universe (z<0.3), our view of galaxy evolution isprimarily based on fibre optic spectroscopy surveys. Elaborate methods havebeen developed to address aperture effects when fixed aperture sizes only probethe inner regions for galaxies of ever decreasing redshift or increasingphysical size. These aperture corrections rely on assumptions about thephysical properties of galaxies. The adequacy of these aperture corrections canbe tested with integral-field spectroscopic data. We use integral-field spectradrawn from 1212 galaxies observed as part of the SAMI Galaxy Survey toinvestigate the validity of two aperture correction methods that attempt toestimate a galaxy's total instantaneous star formation rate. We show thatbiases arise when assuming that instantaneous star formation is traced bybroadband imaging, and when the aperture correction is built only from spectraof the nuclear region of galaxies. These biases may be significant depending onthe selection criteria of a survey sample. Understanding the sensitivities ofthese aperture corrections is essential for correct handling of systematicerrors in galaxy evolution studies.

The SAMI galaxy survey: Galaxy Interactions and Kinematic Anomalies in  Abell 119

  Galaxy mergers are important events that can determine the fate of a galaxyby changing its morphology, star-formation activity and mass growth. Mergersystems have commonly been identified from their disturbed morphologies, and wenow can employ Integral Field Spectroscopy to detect and analyze the impact ofmergers on stellar kinematics as well. We visually classified galaxy morphologyusing deep images ($\mu_{\rm r} = 28\,\rm mag\,\, arcsec^{-2}$) taken by theBlanco 4-m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. In thispaper we investigate 63 bright ($M_{\rm r}<-19.3$) spectroscopically-selectedgalaxies in Abell 119; of which 53 are early type and 20 galaxies show adisturbed morphology by visual inspection. A misalignment between the majoraxes in the photometric image and the kinematic map is conspicuous inmorphologically-disturbed galaxies. Our sample is dominated by early-typegalaxies, yet it shows a surprisingly tight Tully-Fisher relation except forthe morphologically-disturbed galaxies which show large deviations. Three outof the eight slow rotators in our sample are morphology disturbed. Thevisually-selected morphologically-disturbed galaxies are generally moreasymmetric, visually as well as kinematically. Our findings suggest that galaxyinteractions, including mergers and perhaps fly-bys, play an important role indetermining the orientation and magnitude of galaxy's angular momentum.

The Case for Electron Re-Acceleration at Galaxy Cluster Shocks

  On the largest scales, the Universe consists of voids and filaments making upthe cosmic web. Galaxy clusters are located at the knots in this web, at theintersection of filaments. Clusters grow through accretion from theselarge-scale filaments and by mergers with other clusters and groups. In agrowing number of galaxy clusters, elongated Mpc-size radio sources have beenfound, so-called radio relics. These relics are thought to trace relativisticelectrons in the intracluster plasma accelerated by low-Mach numbercollisionless shocks generated by cluster-cluster merger events. Along-standing problem is how low-Mach number shocks can accelerate electrons soefficiently to explain the observed radio relics. Here we report on thediscovery of a direct connection between a radio relic and a radio galaxy inthe merging galaxy cluster Abell 3411-3412. This discovery indicates thatfossil relativistic electrons from active galactic nuclei are re-accelerated atcluster shocks. It also implies that radio galaxies play an important role ingoverning the non-thermal component of the intracluster medium in mergingclusters.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Early Data Release

  We present the Early Data Release of the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integralfield spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. The SAMI Galaxy Survey is an ongoingintegral field spectroscopic survey of ~3400 low-redshift (z<0.12) galaxies,covering galaxies in the field and in groups within the Galaxy And MassAssembly (GAMA) survey regions, and a sample of galaxies in clusters.  In the Early Data Release, we publicly release the fully calibrated datacubesfor a representative selection of 107 galaxies drawn from the GAMA regions,along with information about these galaxies from the GAMA catalogues. Alldatacubes for the Early Data Release galaxies can be downloaded individually oras a set from the SAMI Galaxy Survey website.  In this paper we also assess the quality of the pipeline used to reduce theSAMI data, giving metrics that quantify its performance at all stages inprocessing the raw data into calibrated datacubes. The pipeline gives excellentresults throughout, with typical sky subtraction residuals in the continuum of0.9-1.2 per cent, a relative flux calibration uncertainty of 4.1 per cent(systematic) plus 4.3 per cent (statistical), and atmospheric dispersionremoved with an accuracy of 0."09, less than a fifth of a spaxel.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: extraplanar gas, galactic winds, and their  association with star formation history

  We investigate a sample of 40 local, main-sequence, edge-on disc galaxiesusing integral field spectroscopy with the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integralfield spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey to understand the link betweenproperties of the extraplanar gas and their host galaxies. The kinematicsproperties of the extraplanar gas, including velocity asymmetries and increaseddispersion, are used to differentiate galaxies hosting large-scale galacticwinds from those dominated by the extended diffuse ionized gas. We find ratherthat a spectrum of diffuse gas-dominated to wind dominated galaxies exist. Thewind-dominated galaxies span a wide range of star formation rates ($-1 \lesssim\log({\rm SFR/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}) \lesssim 0.5$) across the whole stellar massrange of the sample ($8.5 \lesssim \log({\rm M_{*}/M_{\odot}}) \lesssim 11$).The wind galaxies also span a wide range in SFR surface densities ($10^{-3}\textrm{--} 10^{-1.5}\rm~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$) that is much lower thanthe canonical threshold of $\rm0.1~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$. The windgalaxies on average have higher SFR surface densities and higher $\rmH\delta_A$ values than those without strong wind signatures. The enhanced $\rmH\delta_A$ indicates that bursts of star formation in the recent past arenecessary for driving large-scale galactic winds. We demonstrate with SloanDigital Sky Survey data that galaxies with high SFR surface density haveexperienced bursts of star formation in the recent past. Our results imply thatthe galactic winds revealed in our study are indeed driven by bursts of starformation, and thus probing star formation in the time domain is crucial forfinding and understanding galactic winds.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Revisiting Galaxy Classification Through  High-Order Stellar Kinematics

  Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggest that integral fieldspectroscopy can connect the high-order stellar kinematic moments h3(~skewness) and h4 (~kurtosis) in galaxies to their cosmological assemblyhistory. Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on asample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using 2D integralfield data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. A proxy for the spin parameter($\lambda_{R_e}$) and ellipticity ($\epsilon_e$) are used to separate fast andslow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regularrotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm thatregular rotators show a strong h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation, whereasquasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h3 and$V/\sigma$. Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop analternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individualh3 versus $V/\sigma$ signatures. We identify five classes of high-order stellarkinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slowrotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find thatgalaxies with similar $\lambda_{R_e}-\epsilon_e$ values can show distinctlydifferent h3-$V/\sigma$ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentifiedfast rotators that show a weak h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation. Theseobjects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. Frommorphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks.Instead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, havecounter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret thestrong anti-correlation in h3 versus $V/\sigma$ as evidence for disks in mostfast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators.
