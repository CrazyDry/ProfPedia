Numerical coincidences and 'tuning' in cosmology

  Fred Hoyle famously drew attention to the significance of apparentcoincidences in the energy levels of the carbon and oxygen nucleus. This paperaddresses the possible implications of other coincidences in cosmology.

Narrow Gauge and Analytical Branching Strategies for Mixed Integer  Programming

  State-of-the-art branch and bound algorithms for mixed integer programmingmake use of special methods for making branching decisions. Strategies thathave gained prominence include modern variants of so-called strong branching(Applegate, et al.,1995) and reliability branching (Achterberg, Koch andMartin, 2005; Hendel, 2015), which select variables for branching by solvingassociated linear programs and exploit pseudo-costs (Benichou et al., 1971). Wesuggest new branching criteria and propose alternative branching approachescalled narrow gauge and analytical branching. The perspective underlying ourapproaches is to focus on prioritization of child nodes to examine fewercandidate variables at the current node of the B&B tree, balanced withprocedures to extrapolate the implications of choosing these candidates bygenerating a small-depth look-ahead tree. Our procedures can also be used inrules to select among open tree nodes (those whose child nodes have not yetbeen generated). We incorporate pre- and post-winnowing procedures toprogressively isolate preferred branching candidates, and employ derivative(created) variables whose branches are able to explore the solution space moredeeply.

The Dark Matter Problem in Light of Quantum Gravity

  We show how, by considering the cumulative effect of tiny quantumgravitational fluctuations over very large distances, it may be possible to:($a$) reconcile nucleosynthesis bounds on the density parameter of the Universewith the predictions of inflationary cosmology, and ($b$) reproduce theinferred variation of the density parameter with distance. Our calculation canbe interpreted as a computation of the contribution of quantum gravitationaldegrees of freedom to the (local) energy density of the Universe.

Quasiconformal homogeneity after Gehring and Palks

  In a very influential paper Gehring and Palka introduced the notions ofquasiconformally homogeneous and uniformly quasiconformally homogeneous subsetsof Euclidean space. Their motivation was to provide a characterization ofquasi-disks, i.e. domains which are quasiconformally homeomorphic to the unitdisk. As a generalization, Bonfert-Taylor, Canary, Martin and Taylor initiatedthe study of uniformly quasiconformally homogeneous hyperbolic manifolds. Inthis paper, we review the theory of quasiconformally homogeneous subsets ofEuclidean and uniformly quasiconformally homogeneous hyperbolic manifolds. Wefinish with a discussion of open problems in the theory.

Auxiliary Field Loop expansion for the Effective Action for Stochastic  Partial Differential equations II

  We extend our discussion of effective actions for stochastic partialdifferential equations to systems that give rise to a Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR)type of action. This type of action naturally arises when one uses themany-body formalism of Doi and Peliti to describe reaction-diffusion modelswhich undergo transitions into the absorbing state and which are described by aMaster equation. These models include predator prey models, and directedpercolation models as well as chemical kinetic models. For classical dynamicalsystems with external noise it is always possible to construct an MSR action.  Using a path integral representation for the generator of the correlationfunctions, we show how, by introducing a composite auxiliary field, one cangenerate an auxiliary field loop expansion for the effective action for bothtypes of systems. As a specific example of the Doi-Peliti formalism wedetermine the effective action for the chemical reaction annihilation anddiffusion process $A+A \rightarrow 0$. For the external noise problem weevaluate the effective action for the Cole-Hopf form of the Kardar-Parisi Zhang(KPZ) equation as well as for the Ginzburg Landau model of spin relaxation. Wedetermine for arbitrary spatial dimension $d$, the renormalized effectivepotential in leading order in the auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF) andalso determine the renormalization group equation for the running of thereaction rate (coupling constant) for arbitrary $d$. We compare our resultswith known perturbative and non-perturbative results for the renormalizationgroup equations.

A Million-Second Chandra View of Cassiopeia A

  We introduce a million-second observation of the supernova remnant CassiopeiaA with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The bipolar structure of the Si-richejecta (NE jet and SW counterpart) is clearly evident in the new images, andtheir chemical similarity is confirmed by their spectra. These are most likelydue to jets of ejecta as opposed to cavities in the circumstellar medium, sincewe can reject simple models for the latter. The properties of these jets andthe Fe-rich ejecta will provide clues to the explosion of Cas A.

The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey: Galaxy Evolution at 0.25 < z < 0.75  Using The Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2)

  We study the evolution of galaxy populations around the spectroscopic WiggleZsample of starforming galaxies at 0.25 < z < 0.75 using the photometric catalogfrom the Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2). We probe the opticalphotometric properties of the net excess neighbor galaxies. The key concept isthat the marker galaxies and their neighbors are located at the same redshift,providing a sample of galaxies representing a complete census of galaxies inthe neighborhood of star-forming galaxies. The results are compared with thoseusing the RCS WiggleZ Spare-Fibre (RCS-WSF) sample as markers, representinggalaxies in cluster environments at 0.25 < z < 0.45. By analyzing the stackedcolor-color properties of the WiggleZ neighbor galaxies, we find that theiroptical colors are not a strong function of indicators of star-formingactivities such as EW([OII]) or GALEX NUV luminoisty of the markers. Thegalaxies around the WiggleZ markers exhibit a bimodal distribution on thecolor-magnitude diagram, with most of them located in the blue cloud. Theoptical galaxy luminosity functions (GLF) of the blue neighbor galaxies have afaint-end slope \alpha of \sim -1.3, similar to that for galaxies in clusterenvironments drawn from the RCS-WSF sample. The faint-end slope of the GLF forthe red neighbors, however, is \sim -0.4, significantly shallower than the \sim-0.7 found for those in cluster environments. This suggests that the build-upof the faint-end of the red sequence in cluster environments is in asignificantly more advanced stage than that in the star-forming and lowergalaxy density WiggleZ neighborhoods. We find that the red galaxy fraction(fred) around the star-forming WiggleZ galaxies has similar values from z \sim0.3 to z \sim 0.6 with fred \sim 0.28, but drops to fred \sim 0.20 at z >\sim0.7. This change of fred with redshift suggests that (and more...)

The Kruskal Count

  The Kruskal Count is a card trick invented by Martin J. Kruskal in which amagician "guesses" a card selected by a subject according to a certain countingprocedure. With high probability the magician can correctly "guess" the card.The success of the trick is based on a mathematical principle related tocoupling methods for Markov chains. This paper analyzes in detail twosimplified variants of the trick and estimates the probability of success. Themodel predictions are compared with simulation data for several variants of theactual trick.

Auxiliary Field Loop Expansion of the Effective Action for Stochastic  Partial Differential Equations

  We present an alternative to the perturbative diagrammatic approach forstudying stochastic dynamics. Our approach is based on an auxiliary field loopexpansion for the path integral representation for the generating functional ofthe noise induced correlation functions. We derive two different effectiveactions, one based on the Onsager-Machlup (OM) approach, and the other on theMartin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) response function approach. In particular we determinethe leading order approximation for the effective action and effectivepotential for arbitrary spatial dimensions for several simple systems. Theseinclude the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, the chemical reactionannihilation and diffusion process $A+A \rightarrow 0$, and the Ginzburg-Landau(GL) model for spin relaxation. We show how to obtain the effective potentialof the OM approach from the effective potential in the MSR approach. For theKPZ equation we find that our approximation, which is non-perturbative andobeys broken symmetry Ward identities, does not lead to the appearance of afluctuation induced symmetry breakdown. This contradicts the results of earlierstudies. We also obtain some of the renormalization group flows directly fromthe effective potential and compare our results with exact and perturbativeresults.

Spatial Models for Field Trials

  An important aim of the analysis of agricultural field trials is to obtaingood predictions for genotypic performance, by correcting for spatial effects.In practice these corrections turn out to be complicated, since there can bedifferent types of spatial effects; those due to management interventionsapplied to the field plots and those due to various kinds of erratic spatialtrends. This paper presents models for field trials in which the random spatialcomponent consists of tensor product Penalized splines (P-splines). A specialANOVA-type reformulation leads to five smooth additive spatial components,which form the basis of a mixed model with five unknown variance components. Ontop of this spatial field, effects of genotypes, blocks, replicates, and/orother sources of spatial variation are described by a mixed model in a standardway. We show the relation between several definitions of heritability and theeffective dimension or the effective degrees of freedom associated to thegenetic component. The approach is illustrated with large-scale field trialexperiments. An R-package is provided.

Learning Steerable Filters for Rotation Equivariant CNNs

  In many machine learning tasks it is desirable that a model's predictiontransforms in an equivariant way under transformations of its input.Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implement translational equivariance byconstruction; for other transformations, however, they are compelled to learnthe proper mapping. In this work, we develop Steerable Filter CNNs (SFCNNs)which achieve joint equivariance under translations and rotations by design.The proposed architecture employs steerable filters to efficiently computeorientation dependent responses for many orientations without sufferinginterpolation artifacts from filter rotation. We utilize group convolutionswhich guarantee an equivariant mapping. In addition, we generalize He's weightinitialization scheme to filters which are defined as a linear combination of asystem of atomic filters. Numerical experiments show a substantial enhancementof the sample complexity with a growing number of sampled filter orientationsand confirm that the network generalizes learned patterns over orientations.The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the rotated MNIST benchmarkand on the ISBI 2012 2D EM segmentation challenge.

Mining and Forecasting Career Trajectories of Music Artists

  Many musicians, from up-and-comers to established artists, rely heavily onperforming live to promote and disseminate their music. To advertise liveshows, artists often use concert discovery platforms that make it easier fortheir fans to track tour dates. In this paper, we ask whether digital traces oflive performances generated on those platforms can be used to understand careertrajectories of artists. First, we present a new dataset we constructed bycross-referencing data from such platforms. We then demonstrate how thisdataset can be used to mine and predict important career milestones for themusicians, such as signing by a major music label, or performing at a certainvenue. Finally, we perform a temporal analysis of the bipartite artist-venuegraph, and demonstrate that high centrality on this graph is correlated withsuccess.

The Geometry and Arithmetic of Kleinian Groups

  In this article we survey and describe various aspects of the geometry andarithmetic of Kleinian groups - discrete nonelementary groups of isometries ofhyperbolic $3$-space. In particular we make a detailed study of two-generatorgroups and discuss the classification of the arithmetic generalised trianglegroups (and their near relatives). This work is mainly based around mycollaborations over the last two decades with Fred Gehring and ColinMaclachlan, both of whom passed away in 2012. There are many others involved aswell.  Over the last few decades the theory of Kleinian groups has flourishedbecause of its intimate connections with low dimensional topology and geometry.We give little of the general theory and its connections with $3$-manifoldtheory here, but focus on two main problems: Siegel's problem of identifyingthe minimal covolume hyperbolic lattice and the Margulis constant problem.These are both "universal constraints" on Kleinian groups -- a feature ofdiscrete isometry groups in negative curvature and include results such asJ{\o}rgensen's inequality, the higher dimensional version of Hurwitz's $84g-84$theorem and a number of other things. We will see that big part of the worknecessary to obtain these results is in getting concrete descriptions ofvarious analytic spaces of two-generator Kleinian groups, somewhat akin to theRiley slice.

Chandra Survey of Radio-quiet, High-redshift Quasars

  We observed 17 optically-selected, radio-quiet high-redshift quasars with theChandra Observatory ACIS, and detected 16 of them. The quasars have redshiftbetween 3.70 and 6.28 and include the highest redshift quasars known. Whencompared to low-redshift quasars observed with ROSAT, these high redshiftquasars are significantly more X-ray quiet. We also find that the X-rayspectral index of the high redshift objects is flatter than the average atlower redshift. These trends confirm the predictions of models where theaccretion flow is described by a cold, optically-thick accretion disksurrounded by a hot, optically thin corona, provided the viscosity parameteralpha >= 0.02. The high redshift quasars have supermassive black holes withmasses ~10^{10} M_{sun}, and are accreting material at ~0.1 the Eddingtonlimit. We detect 10 X-ray photons from the z=6.28 quasar SDS 1030+0524, whichmay have a Gunn-Peterson trough and be near the redshift of reionization of theintergalactic medium. The X-ray data place an upper limit on the optical depthof the intergalactic medium tau(IGM) < 10^6, compared to the lower limit fromthe spectrum of Lyalpha and Lybeta, which implies tau(IGM) > 20.

Gauge Dependence in Chern-Simons Theory

  We compute the contribution to the modulus of the one-loop effective actionin pure non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory in an arbitrary covariant gauge. Wefind that the results are dependent on both the gauge parameter ($\alpha$) andthe metric required in the gauge fixing. A contribution arises that has notbeen previously encountered; it is of the form $(\alpha / \sqrt{p^2}) \epsilon_{\mu \lambda \nu} p^\lambda$. This is possible as in three dimensions $\alpha$is dimensionful. A variant of proper time regularization is used to renderthese integrals well behaved (although no divergences occur when theregularization is turned off at the end of the calculation). Since the originalLagrangian is unaltered in this approach, no symmetries of the classical theoryare explicitly broken and $\epsilon_{\mu \lambda \nu}$ is handled unambiguouslysince the system is three dimensional at all stages of the calculation. Theresults are shown to be consistent with the so-called Nielsen identities whichpredict the explicit gauge parameter dependence using an extension of BRSsymmetry. We demonstrate that this $\alpha$ dependence may potentiallycontribute to the vacuum expectation values of products of Wilson loops.

Hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment Workshop.  $(g-2)_μ$: Quo vadis? Workshop. Mini proceedings

WASP-47: A Hot Jupiter System with Two Additional Planets Discovered by  K2

  Using new data from the K2 mission, we show that WASP-47, a previously knownhot Jupiter host, also hosts two additional transiting planets: a Neptune-sizedouter planet and a super-Earth inner companion. We measure planetary propertiesfrom the K2 light curve and detect transit timing variations, confirming theplanetary nature of the outer planet. We performed a large number of numericalsimulations to study the dynamical stability of the system and to find thetheoretically expected transit timing variations (TTVs). The theoreticallypredicted TTVs are in good agreement with those observed, and we use the TTVsto determine the masses of two planets, and place a limit on the third. TheWASP-47 planetary system is important because companion planets can both beinferred by TTVs and are also detected directly through transit observations.The depth of the hot Jupiter's transits make ground-based TTV measurementspossible, and the brightness of the host star makes it amenable for preciseradial velocity measurements. The system serves as a Rosetta Stone forunderstanding TTVs as a planet detection technique.

Evaluating arbitrary strain configurations and doping in graphene with  Raman spectroscopy

  Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the local propertiesof graphene. Here, we introduce a method for evaluating unknown strainconfigurations and simultaneous doping. It relies on separating the effects ofhydrostatic strain (peak shift) and shear strain (peak splitting) on the Ramanspectrum of graphene. The peak shifts from hydrostatic strain and doping areseparated with a correlation analysis of the 2D and G frequencies. This enablesus to obtain the local hydrostatic strain, shear strain and doping without anyassumption on the strain configuration prior to the analysis. We demonstrateour approach for two model cases: Graphene under uniaxial stress on a PMMAsubstrate and graphene suspended on nanostructures that induce an unknownstrain configuration. We measured $\omega_\mathrm{2D}/\omega_\mathrm{G} = 2.21\pm 0.05$ for pure hydrostatic strain. Raman scattering with circularcorotating polarization is ideal for analyzing strain and doping, especiallyfor weak strain when the peak splitting by shear strain cannot be resolved.

Reassessment of the basis of cell size control based on analysis of  cell-to-cell variability

  Fundamental mechanisms governing cell size control and homeostasis are stillpoorly understood. The relationship between sizes at division and birth insingle cells is used as a metric to categorize the basis of size homeostasis[1-3]. Cells dividing at a fixed size regardless of birth size (sizer) areexpected to show a division-birth slope of 0, whereas cells dividing aftergrowing for a fixed size increment (adder) have an expected slope of +1 [4].These two theoretical values are, however, rarely experimentally observed. Herewe investigate possible reasons for this discrepancy. Rod-shaped fission yeast$\it{Schizosaccharomyces}$ $\it{pombe}$ cells divide at a fixed surface area[5, 6], and exhibit a division-birth slope of 0.23$\pm$0.04, significantlydifferent from the sizer value of zero. To understand whether fission yeastuses a mix of sizer and adder control, or whether size sensing is simplyimprecise, we developed a mathematical model of sizer control, including therelevant sources of variation. Our results support $\it{pure}$ sizer controland show that deviation from zero slope is exaggerated by measurement of aninappropriate geometrical quantity (e.g., length instead of area), combinedwith cell-to-cell radius variability. The model predicts that mutants withgreater errors in size sensing or septum positioning paradoxically appear tobehave as better sizers. Furthermore, accounting for cell width variability, weshow that pure sizer control can in some circumstances reproduce the apparentadder behaviour observed in $\it{E. coli}$. These findings demonstrate thatrefined analysis of geometric variation can lead to new insights into cell sizecontrol.

STIS Spectral Imagery of the OB Stars in NGC 604: The Most Luminous  Stars

  We present results using 2-D spectral imagery and photometry obtained withthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for the starburst H II region, NGC 604, innearby galaxy M33. The spectral imagery was acquired with the Space TelescopeImaging Spectrograph (STIS) using the MAMA/G140L configuration, spanning1170-1730 A. From a single 1720 sec STIS exposure, we extracted spectra for 49stars and derived individual UV spectral types for 40 stars in the crowded25"x2" stellar field. These stars represent a significant fraction of theyoung, luminous O and B stars. Three objects have pronounced He II 1640emission, the signature of W-R or luminous Of stars. By combining UV fluxeswith WFPC and WFPC2 visual photometry, we derive the extinction curve for NGC604. We use this curve, the distance for M33, derived UV spectral types, andHST photometry, to determine positions of these stars in the upper H-R diagram.The revised O star effective temperature scale (Martins et al.) is essential inobtaining reliable positions in the log(L*)-log(T(eff)) plane. These stars arequite young with an age of ~3 Myr. The spectra and photometry indicate threeexceedingly luminous objects. Their inferred locations in the H-R diagramindicate stellar masses > 120 solar masses. High spatial resolution HST imageryprovides no evidence of multiple stars composing these objects. Still we cannoteliminate the possibility that they are unresolved multiple stars of lowermass, possibly W-R stars. Tests demonstrate that the ten most luminous starspredominantly determine the UV spectral features seen in the total light of NGC604. We conclude that interpretation of spectral fitting of more distantstarburst galaxies, where individual stars are not resolved, must be done withextreme care.

Ices in the edge-on disk CRBR 2422.8-3423: Spitzer spectroscopy and  Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling

  We present 5.2-37.2 micron spectroscopy of the edge-on circumstellar diskCRBR 2422.8-3423 obtained using the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) of the SpitzerSpace Telescope. The IRS spectrum is combined with ground-based 3-5 micronspectroscopy to obtain a complete inventory of solid state material presentalong the line of sight toward the source. We model the object with a 2Daxisymmetric (effectively 3D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. It is foundthat the model disk, assuming a standard flaring structure, is too warm tocontain the very large observed column density of pure CO ice, but is possiblyresponsible for up to 50% of the water, CO2 and minor ice species. Inparticular the 6.85 micron band, tentatively due to NH4+, exhibits a prominentred wing, indicating a significant contribution from warm ice in the disk. Itis argued that the pure CO ice is located in the dense core Oph-F in front ofthe source seen in the submillimeter imaging, with the CO gas in the corehighly depleted. The model is used to predict which circumstances are mostfavourable for direct observations of ices in edge-on circumstellar disks. Icebands will in general be deepest for inclinations similar to the disk openingangle, i.e. ~70 degrees. Due to the high optical depths of typical diskmid-planes, ice absorption bands will often probe warmer ice located in theupper layers of nearly edge-on disks. The ratios between different ice bandsare found to vary by up to an order of magnitude depending on disk inclinationdue to radiative transfer effects caused by the 2D structure of the disk.Ratios between ice bands of the same species can therefore be used to constrainthe location of the ices in a circumstellar disk.

Modeling Spitzer observations of VV Ser. I. The circumstellar disk of a  UX Orionis star

  We present mid-infrared Spitzer-IRS spectra of the well-known UX Orionis starVV Ser. We combine the Spitzer data with interferometric and spectroscopic datafrom the literature covering UV to submillimeter wavelengths. The full set ofdata are modeled by a two-dimensional axisymmetric Monte Carlo radiativetransfer code. The model is used to test the prediction of (Dullemond et al.2003) that disks around UX Orionis stars must have a self-shadowed shape, andthat these disks are seen nearly edge-on, looking just over the edge of apuffed-up inner rim, formed roughly at the dust sublimation radius. We findthat a single, relatively simple model is consistent with all the availableobservational constraints spanning 4 orders of magnitude in wavelength andspatial scales, providing strong support for this interpretation of UX Orionisstars. The grains in the upper layers of the puffed-up inner rim must be small(0.01-0.4 micron) to reproduce the colors (R_V ~ 3.6) of the extinction events,while the shape and strength of the mid-infrared silicate emission featuresindicate that grains in the outer disk (> 1-2 AU) are somewhat larger (0.3-3.0micron). From the model fit, the location of the puffed-up inner rim isestimated to be at a dust temperature of 1500 K or at 0.7-0.8 AU for smallgrains. This is almost twice the rim radius estimated from near-infraredinterferometry. A best fitting model for the inner rim in which large grains inthe disk mid-plane reach to within 0.25 AU of the star, while small grains inthe disk surface create a puffed-up inner rim at ~0.7-0.8 AU, is able toreproduce all the data, including the near-infrared visibilities.

The c2d Spitzer spectroscopic survey of ices around low-mass young  stellar objects II: CO2

  This paper presents Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy of the CO2 15.2 micron bendingmode toward a sample of 50 embedded low-mass stars in nearby star-formingclouds, taken mostly from the ``Cores to Disks (c2d)'' Legacy program. Theaverage abundance of solid CO2 relative to water in low-mass protostellarenvelopes is 0.32 +/- 0.02, significantly higher than that found in quiescentmolecular clouds and in massive star forming regions. It is found that adecomposition of all the observed CO2 bending mode profiles requires a minimumof five unique components. Roughly 2/3 of the CO2 ice is found in a water-richenvironment, while most of the remaining 1/3 is found in a CO environment.Ground-based observations of solid CO toward a large subset of the c2d sampleare used to further constrain the CO2:CO component and suggest a model in whichlow-density clouds form the CO2:H2O component and higher density clouds formthe CO2:CO ice during and after the freeze-out of gas-phase CO. It is suggestedthat the subsequent evolution of the CO2 and CO profiles toward low-massprotostars, in particular the appearance of the splitting of the CO2 bendingmode due to pure, crystalline CO2, is first caused by distillation of theCO2:CO component through evaporation of CO due to thermal processing to ~20-30K in the inner regions of infalling envelopes. The formation of pure CO2 viasegregation from the H2O rich mantle may contribute to the band splitting athigher levels of thermal processing (>50 K), but is harder to reconcile withthe physical structure of protostellar envelopes around low-luminosity objects.

Intersections of Quadrics, Moment-angle Manifolds and Connected Sums

  The topology of the intersection of two real homogeneous coaxial quadrics wasstudied by the second author who showed that its intersection with the unitsphere is in most cases diffeomorphic to a connected sum of sphere products.Combining that approach with a recent one (due to Antony Bahri, MartinBendersky, Fred Cohen and the first author) we study here the intersections ofk>2 quadrics and we identify very general families of such manifolds that arediffeomorphic to connected sums of sphere products. These include thosemoment-angle manifolds for which the result was conjectured by Frederic Bosioand Laurent Meersseman. As a byproduct, a simpler and neater proof of theresult for the case k=2 is obtained.  Two new sections contain results not included in the first version of thisarticle: Section 2 describes the topological change on the manifolds after theoperations of cutting off a vertex or an edge of the associated polytope, whichcan be combined in a special way with the previos results to produce newinfinite families of manifolds that are connected sums of sphere products. Inother cases we get slightly more complicated manifolds: with this we solveanother question by Bosio-Meersseman about the manifold associated to thetruncated cube.  In Section 3 we use this to show that the known rules for the cohomologyproduct of a moment-angle manifold have to be drastically modified in thegeneral situation. We state the modified rule, but leave the details of thisfor another publication.  Section 0 recalls known definitions and results and in section 2.1 someelementary topological constructions are defined and explored. In the Appendixwe state and prove some results about specific differentiable manifolds, whichare used in sections 1 and 2.

Stellar Imager (SI): developing and testing a predictive dynamo model  for the Sun by imaging other stars

  The Stellar Imager mission concept is a space-based UV/Optical interferometerdesigned to resolve surface magnetic activity and subsurface structure andflows of a population of Sun-like stars, in order to accelerate the developmentand validation of a predictive dynamo model for the Sun and enable accuratelong-term forecasting of solar/stellar magnetic activity.

An Earth-sized Planet in the Habitable Zone of a Cool Star

  The quest for Earth-like planets represents a major focus of currentexoplanet research. While planets that are Earth-sized and smaller have beendetected, these planets reside in orbits that are too close to their host starto allow liquid water on their surface. We present the detection ofKepler-186f, a 1.11+\-0.14 Earth radius planet that is the outermost of fiveplanets - all roughly Earth-sized - that transit a 0.47+\-0.05 Rsun star. Theintensity and spectrum of the star's radiation places Kepler-186f in thestellar habitable zone, implying that if Kepler-186f has an Earth-likeatmosphere and H2O at its surface, then some of this H2O is likely to be inliquid form.

Marker-based estimation of heritability in immortal populations

  Heritability is a central parameter in quantitative genetics, both from anevolutionary and a breeding perspective. For plant traits heritability istraditionally estimated by comparing within and between genotype variability.This approach estimates broad-sense heritability, and does not account fordifferent genetic relatedness. With the availability of high-density markersthere is growing interest in marker based estimates of narrow-senseheritability, using mixed models in which genetic relatedness is estimated fromgenetic markers. Such estimates have received much attention in human geneticsbut are rarely reported for plant traits. A major obstacle is that currentmethodology and software assume a single phenotypic value per genotype, hencerequiring genotypic means. An alternative that we propose here, is to use mixedmodels at individual plant or plot level. Using statistical arguments,simulations and real data we investigate the feasibility of both approaches,and how these affect genomic prediction with G-BLUP and genome-wide associationstudies. Heritability estimates obtained from genotypic means had very largestandard errors and were sometimes biologically unrealistic. Mixed models atindividual plant or plot level produced more realistic estimates, and forsimulated traits standard errors were up to 13 times smaller. Genomicprediction was also improved by using these mixed models, with up to a 49%increase in accuracy. For GWAS on simulated traits, the use of individual plantdata gave almost no increase in power. The new methodology is applicable to anycomplex trait where multiple replicates of individual genotypes can be scored.This includes important agronomic crops, as well as bacteria and fungi.

Multicore fibre technology - the road to multimode photonics

  For the past forty years, optical fibres have found widespread use inground-based and space-based instruments. In most applications, these fibresare used in conjunction with conventional optics to transport light. Butphotonics offers a huge range of optical manipulations beyond light transportthat were rarely exploited before 2001. The fundamental obstacle to the broaderuse of photonics is the difficulty of achieving photonic action in a multimodefibre. The first step towards a general solution was the invention of thephotonic lantern (Leon-Saval, Birks & Bland-Hawthorn 2005) and the delivery ofhigh-efficiency devices (< 1 dB loss) five years on (Noordegraaf et al 2009).Multicore fibres (MCF), used in conjunction with lanterns, are now enabling aneven bigger leap towards multimode photonics. Until recently, the single-modedcores in MCFs were not sufficiently uniform to achieve telecom (SMF-28)performance. Now that high-quality MCFs have been realized, we turn ourattention to printing complex functions (e.g. Bragg gratings for OHsuppression) into their N cores. Our first work in this direction used aMach-Zehnder interferometer (near-field phase mask) but this approach was onlyadequate for N=7 MCFs as measured by the grating uniformity (Lindley et al2014). We have now built a Sagnac interferometer that gives a three-foldincrease in the depth of field sufficient to print across N > 127 cores. Weachieved first light this year with our 500mW Sabre FRED laser. These aresophisticated and complex interferometers. We report on our progress to dateand summarize our first-year goals which include multimode OH suppressionfibres for the Anglo-Australian Telescope/PRAXIS instrument and the DiscoveryChannel Telescope/MOHSIS instrument under development at the University ofMaryland.

The GALAH survey: The data reduction pipeline

  We present the data reduction procedures being used by the GALAH survey,carried out with the HERMES fibre-fed, multi-object spectrograph on the 3.9~mAnglo-Australian Telescope. GALAH is a unique survey, targeting 1 million starsbrighter than magnitude V=14 at a resolution of 28,000 with a goal to measurethe abundances of 29 elements. Such a large number of high resolution spectranecessitates the development of a reduction pipeline optimized for speed,accuracy, and consistency. We outline the design and structure of theIraf-based reduction pipeline that we developed, specifically for GALAH, toproduce fully calibrated spectra aimed for subsequent stellar atmosphericparameter estimation. The pipeline takes advantage of existing Iraf routinesand other readily available software so as to be simple to maintain, testableand reliable. A radial velocity and stellar atmospheric parameter estimatorcode is also presented, which is used for further data analysis and yields auseful verification of the reduction quality. We have used this estimator toquantify the data quality of GALAH for fibre cross-talk level ($\lesssim0.5$%)and scattered light ($\sim5$ counts in a typical 20 minutes exposure),resolution across the field, sky spectrum properties, wavelength solutionreliability (better than $1$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ accuracy) and radialvelocity precision.

The GALAH Survey: Observational Overview and Gaia DR1 companion

  The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey is a massiveobservational project to trace the Milky Way's history of star formation,chemical enrichment, stellar migration and minor mergers. Using high-resolution(R$\simeq$28,000) spectra taken with the High Efficiency and ResolutionMulti-Element Spectrograph (HERMES) instrument at the Anglo-AustralianTelescope (AAT), GALAH will determine stellar parameters and abundances of upto 29 elements for up to one million stars. Selecting targets from acolour-unbiased catalogue built from 2MASS, APASS and UCAC4 data, we expect toobserve dwarfs at 0.3 to 3 kpc and giants at 1 to 10 kpc. This enables athorough local chemical inventory of the Galactic thin and thick disks, andalso captures smaller samples of the bulge and halo. In this paper we presentthe plan, process and progress as of early 2016 for GALAH survey observations.In our first two years of survey observing we have accumulated the largesthigh-quality spectroscopic data set at this resolution, over 200,000 stars. Wealso present the first public GALAH data catalogue: stellar parameters (Teff,log(g), [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe]), radial velocity, distance modulus and reddeningfor 10680 observations of 9860 Tycho-2 stars that may be included in the firstGaia data release.

The GALAH Survey: Stellar streams and how stellar velocity distributions  vary with Galactic longitude, hemisphere and metallicity

  Using GALAH survey data of nearby stars, we look at how structure in theplanar (u,v) velocity distribution depends on metallicity and on viewingdirection within the Galaxy. In nearby stars, with distance d < 1 kpc, theHercules stream is most strongly seen in higher metallicity stars [Fe/H] > 0.2.The Hercules stream peak v value depends on viewed galactic longitude, which weinterpret as due to the gap between the stellar stream and more circular orbitsbeing associated with a specific angular momentum value of about 1640 km/s kpc.The association of the gap with a particular angular momentum value supports abar resonant model for the Hercules stream.  Moving groups previously identified in Hipparcos observations are easiest tosee in stars nearer than 250 pc, and their visibility and peak velocities inthe velocity distributions depends on both viewing direction (galacticlongitude and hemisphere) and metallicity. We infer that there is finestructure in local velocity distributions that varies over distances of a fewhundred pc in the Galaxy.

Constraining the microlensing effect on time delays with new time-delay  prediction model in $H_{0}$ measurements

  Time-delay strong lensing provides a unique way to directly measure theHubble constant ($H_{0}$). The precision of the $H_{0}$ measurement depends onthe uncertainties in the time-delay measurements, the mass distribution of themain deflector(s), and the mass distribution along the line of sight. Tie andKochanek (2018) have proposed a new microlensing effect on time delays based ondifferential magnification of the coherent accretion disc variability of thelensed quasar. If real, this effect could significantly broaden the uncertaintyon the time delay measurements by up to $30\%$ for lens systems such asPG1115+080, which have relatively short time delays and monitoring over severaldifferent epochs. In this paper we develop a new technique that uses thetime-delay ratios and simulated microlensing maps within a Bayesian frameworkin order to limit the allowed combinations of microlensing delays and thus tolessen the uncertainties due to the proposed effect. We show that, under theassumption of Tie and Kochanek (2018), the uncertainty on the time-delaydistance ($D_{\Delta t}$, which is proportional to 1/$H_{0}$) of shorttime-delay ($\sim18$ days) lens, PG1115+080, increases from $\sim7\%$ to$\sim10\%$ by simultaneously fitting the three time-delay measurements from thethree different datasets across twenty years, while in the case of longtime-delay ($\sim90$ days) lens, the microlensing effect on time delays isnegligible as the uncertainty on $D_{\Delta t}$ of RXJ1131-1231 only increasesfrom $\sim2.5\%$ to $\sim2.6\%$.

Post-AGB stars with hot circumstellar dust: binarity of the  low-amplitude pulsators

  While the first binary post-AGB stars were serendipitously discovered, thedistinct characteristics of their Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) allowed usto launch a more systematic search for binaries. We selected post-AGB objectswhich show a broad dust excess often starting already at H or K, pointing tothe presence of a gravitationally bound dusty disc in the system. We started avery extensive multi-wavelength study of those systems and here we report onour radial velocity and photometric monitoring results for six stars of early Ftype, which are pulsators of small amplitude. To determine the radial velocityof low signal-to-noise time-series, we constructed dedicated auto-correlationmasks. The radial velocity variations were subjected to detailed analysis todifferentiate between pulsational variability and variability due to orbitalmotion. Finally orbital minimalisation was performed to constrain the orbitalelements. All of the six objects are binaries, with orbital periods rangingfrom 120 to 1800 days. Five systems have non-circular orbits. The massfunctions range from 0.004 to 0.57 solar mass and the companions are likelyunevolved objects of (very) low initial mass. We argue that these binaries musthave been subject to severe binary interaction when the primary was a coolsupergiant. Although the origin of the circumstellar disc is not wellunderstood, the disc is generally believed to be formed during this stronginteraction phase. The eccentric orbits of these highly evolved objects remainpoorly understood. With the measured orbits and mass functions we conclude thatthe circumbinary discs seem to have a major impact on the evolution of asignificant fraction of binary systems.

GREAT3 results I: systematic errors in shear estimation and the impact  of real galaxy morphology

  We present first results from the third GRavitational lEnsing AccuracyTesting (GREAT3) challenge, the third in a sequence of challenges for testingmethods of inferring weak gravitational lensing shear distortions fromsimulated galaxy images. GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test threespecific questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data withconstant or cosmologically-varying shear fields. The simplest (control)experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution ofsignal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function(PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxymorphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about aspatially-varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematicerror tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in thetypes of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in manyof the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that thepresence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shearcalibration biases by $\sim 1$ per cent for a wide range of methods. Othereffects such as truncation biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and theimpact of galaxy type as measured by the S\'{e}rsic index, are quantified forthe first time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivitiesto galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing anddefocus. Almost all methods' results support the simple model in which additiveshear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.

Status Update of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR Neutrinoless Double Beta  Decay Experiment

  Neutrinoless double beta decay searches play a major role in determiningneutrino properties, in particular the Majorana or Dirac nature of the neutrinoand the absolute scale of the neutrino mass. The consequences of these searchesgo beyond neutrino physics, with implications for Grand Unification andleptogenesis. The \textsc{Majorana} Collaboration is assembling alow-background array of high purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors to search forneutrinoless double-beta decay in $^{76}$Ge. The \textsc{MajoranaDemonstrator}, which is currently being constructed and commissioned at theSanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, will contain 44 kg(30 kg enriched in $^{76}$Ge) of HPGe detectors. Its primary goal is todemonstrate the scalability and background required for a tonne-scale Geexperiment. This is accomplished via a modular design and projected backgroundof less than 3 cnts/tonne-yr in the region of interest. The experiment iscurrently taking data with the first of its enriched detectors.

Companions to APOGEE Stars I: A Milky Way-Spanning Catalog of Stellar  and Substellar Companion Candidates and their Diverse Hosts

  In its three years of operation, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III)Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-1) observed$>$14,000 stars with enough epochs over a sufficient temporal baseline for thefitting of Keplerian orbits. We present the custom orbit-fitting pipeline usedto create this catalog, which includes novel quality metrics that account forthe phase and velocity coverage of a fitted Keplerian orbit. With a typical RVprecision of $\sim100-200$ m s$^{-1}$, APOGEE can probe systems with smallseparation companions down to a few Jupiter masses. Here we present initialresults from a catalog of 382 of the most compelling stellar and substellarcompanion candidates detected by APOGEE, which orbit a variety of host stars indiverse Galactic environments. Of these, 376 have no previously known smallseparation companion. The distribution of companion candidates in this catalogshows evidence for an extremely truncated brown dwarf (BD) desert with apaucity of BD companions only for systems with $a < 0.1-0.2$ AU, with noindication of a desert at larger orbital separation. We propose a few potentialexplanations of this result, some which invoke this catalog's many smallseparation companion candidates found orbiting evolved stars. Furthermore, 16BD and planet candidates have been identified around metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<-0.5$) stars in this catalog, which may challenge the core accretion model forcompanions $>10 M_{Jup}$. Finally, we find all types of companions areubiquitous throughout the Galactic disk with candidate planetary-mass and BDcompanions to distances of $\sim6$ and $\sim16$ kpc, respectively.

The GALAH Survey: Accurate Radial Velocities and Library of Observed  Stellar Template Spectra

  GALAH is a large-scale magnitude-limited southern stellar spectroscopicsurvey. Its second data release (GALAH DR2) provides values of stellarparameters and abundances of 23 elements for 342,682 stars (Buder et al.). Herewe add a description of the public release of radial velocities with a typicalaccuracy of 0.1 km/s for 336,215 of these stars, achievable due to the largewavelength coverage, high resolving power and good signal to noise ratio of theobserved spectra, but also because convective motions in stellar atmosphere andgravitational redshift from the star to the observer are taken into account. Inthe process we derive medians of observed spectra which are nearly noiseless,as they are obtained from between 100 and 1116 observed spectra belonging tothe same bin with a width of 50 K in temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity, and 0.1dex in metallicity. Publicly released 1181 median spectra have a resolvingpower of 28,000 and trace the well-populated stellar types with metallicitiesbetween -0.6 and +0.3. Note that radial velocities from GALAH are an excellentmatch to the accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane derived byGaia for the same stars. The level of accuracy achieved here is adequate forstudies of dynamics within stellar clusters, associations and streams in theGalaxy. So it may be relevant for studies of the distribution of dark matter.

A Compact Multi-Planet System With A Significantly Misaligned Ultra  Short Period Planet

  We report the discovery of a compact multi-planet system orbiting therelatively nearby (78pc) and bright ($K=8.9$) K-star, K2-266 (EPIC248435473).We identify up to six possible planets orbiting K2-266 with estimated periodsof P$_b$ = 0.66, P$_{.02}$ = 6.1, P$_c$ = 7.8, P$_d$ = 14.7, P$_e$ = 19.5, andP$_{.06}$ = 56.7 days and radii of R$_P$ = 3.3 R$_{\oplus}$, 0.646R$_{\oplus}$, 0.705 R$_{\oplus}$, 2.93 R$_{\oplus}$, 2.73 R$_{\oplus}$, and0.90 R$_{\oplus}$, respectively. We are able to confirm the planetary nature oftwo of these planets (d & e) from analyzing their transit timing variations($m_d= 8.9_{-3.8}^{+5.7} M_\oplus$ and $m_e=14.3_{-5.0}^{+6.4} M_\oplus$),confidently validate the planetary nature of two other planets (b & c), andclassify the last two as planetary candidates (K2-266.02 & .06). From asimultaneous fit of all 6 possible planets, we find that K2-266 b's orbit hasan inclination of 75.32$^{\circ}$ while the other five planets haveinclinations of 87-90$^{\circ}$. This observed mutual misalignment may indicatethat K2-266 b formed differently from the other planets in the system. Thebrightness of the host star and the relatively large size of the sub-Neptunesized planets d and e make them well-suited for atmospheric characterizationefforts with facilities like the Hubble Space Telescope and upcoming James WebbSpace Telescope. We also identify an 8.5-day transiting planet candidateorbiting EPIC248435395, a co-moving companion to K2-266.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalog: ninth data release

  We present the Data Release 9 Quasar (DR9Q) catalog from the BaryonOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III.The catalog includes all BOSS objects that were targeted as quasar candidatesduring the survey, are spectrocopically confirmed as quasars via visualinspection, have luminosities Mi[z=2]<-20.5 (in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology withH0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{\rm M}$ = 0.3, and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.7) andeither display at least one emission line with full width at half maximum(FWHM) larger than 500 km/s or, if not, have interesting/complex absorptionfeatures. It includes as well, known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) thatwere reobserved by BOSS. This catalog contains 87,822 quasars (78,086 are newdiscoveries) detected over 3,275 deg$^{2}$ with robust identification andredshift measured by a combination of principal component eigenspectra newlyderived from a training set of 8,632 spectra from SDSS-DR7. The number ofquasars with $z>2.15$ (61,931) is ~2.8 times larger than the number of z>2.15quasars previously known. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongestemission lines (CIV, CIII], MgII). The catalog identifies 7,533 broadabsorption line quasars and gives their characteristics. For each object thecatalog presents five-band (u,g,r,i,z) CCD-based photometry with typicalaccuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and selection method.The catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emissionproperties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys.

STROBE-X: X-ray Timing and Spectroscopy on Dynamical Timescales from  Microseconds to Years

  We present the Spectroscopic Time-Resolving Observatory for Broadband EnergyX-rays (STROBE-X), a probe-class mission concept selected for study by NASA. Itcombines huge collecting area, high throughput, broad energy coverage, andexcellent spectral and temporal resolution in a single facility. STROBE-Xoffers an enormous increase in sensitivity for X-ray spectral timing, extendingthese techniques to extragalactic targets for the first time. It is also anagile mission capable of rapid response to transient events, making it anessential X-ray partner facility in the era of time-domain, multi-wavelength,and multi-messenger astronomy. Optimized for study of the most extremeconditions found in the Universe, its key science objectives include: (1)Robustly measuring mass and spin and mapping inner accretion flows across theblack hole mass spectrum, from compact stars to intermediate-mass objects toactive galactic nuclei. (2) Mapping out the full mass-radius relation ofneutron stars using an ensemble of nearly two dozen rotation-powered pulsarsand accreting neutron stars, and hence measuring the equation of state forultradense matter over a much wider range of densities than explored by NICER.(3) Identifying and studying X-ray counterparts (in the post-Swift era) formultiwavelength and multi-messenger transients in the dynamic sky throughcross-correlation with gravitational wave interferometers, neutrinoobservatories, and high-cadence time-domain surveys in other electromagneticbands. (4) Continuously surveying the dynamic X-ray sky with a large duty cycleand high time resolution to characterize the behavior of X-ray sources over anunprecedentedly vast range of time scales. STROBE-X's formidable capabilitieswill also enable a broad portfolio of additional science.

Catching Element Formation In The Act

  Gamma-ray astronomy explores the most energetic photons in nature to addresssome of the most pressing puzzles in contemporary astrophysics. It encompassesa wide range of objects and phenomena: stars, supernovae, novae, neutron stars,stellar-mass black holes, nucleosynthesis, the interstellar medium, cosmic raysand relativistic-particle acceleration, and the evolution of galaxies. MeVgamma-rays provide a unique probe of nuclear processes in astronomy, directlymeasuring radioactive decay, nuclear de-excitation, and positron annihilation.The substantial information carried by gamma-ray photons allows us to seedeeper into these objects, the bulk of the power is often emitted at gamma-rayenergies, and radioactivity provides a natural physical clock that adds uniqueinformation. New science will be driven by time-domain population studies atgamma-ray energies. This science is enabled by next-generation gamma-rayinstruments with one to two orders of magnitude better sensitivity, larger skycoverage, and faster cadence than all previous gamma-ray instruments. Thistransformative capability permits: (a) the accurate identification of thegamma-ray emitting objects and correlations with observations taken at otherwavelengths and with other messengers; (b) construction of new gamma-ray mapsof the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies where extended regions aredistinguished from point sources; and (c) considerable serendipitous science ofscarce events -- nearby neutron star mergers, for example. Advances intechnology push the performance of new gamma-ray instruments to address a wideset of astrophysical questions.

Measurement of the cosmic ray spectrum above $4{\times}10^{18}$ eV using  inclined events detected with the Pierre Auger Observatory

  A measurement of the cosmic-ray spectrum for energies exceeding$4{\times}10^{18}$ eV is presented, which is based on the analysis of showerswith zenith angles greater than $60^{\circ}$ detected with the Pierre AugerObservatory between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013. The measured spectrumconfirms a flux suppression at the highest energies. Above $5.3{\times}10^{18}$eV, the "ankle", the flux can be described by a power law $E^{-\gamma}$ withindex $\gamma=2.70 \pm 0.02 \,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.1\,\text{(sys)}$ followed bya smooth suppression region. For the energy ($E_\text{s}$) at which thespectral flux has fallen to one-half of its extrapolated value in the absenceof suppression, we find$E_\text{s}=(5.12\pm0.25\,\text{(stat)}^{+1.0}_{-1.2}\,\text{(sys)}){\times}10^{19}$eV.

An improved limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos  from the Pierre Auger Observatory

  Neutrinos in the cosmic ray flux with energies near 1 EeV and above aredetectable with the Surface Detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Wereport here on searches through Auger data from 1 January 2004 until 20 June2013. No neutrino candidates were found, yielding a limit to the diffuse fluxof ultra-high energy neutrinos that challenges the Waxman-Bahcall boundpredictions. Neutrino identification is attempted using the broadtime-structure of the signals expected in the SD stations, and is efficientlydone for neutrinos of all flavors interacting in the atmosphere at large zenithangles, as well as for "Earth-skimming" neutrino interactions in the case oftau neutrinos. In this paper the searches for downward-going neutrinos in thezenith angle bins $60^\circ-75^\circ$ and $75^\circ-90^\circ$ as well as forupward-going neutrinos, are combined to give a single limit. The $90\%$ C.L.single-flavor limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos with an$E^{-2}$ spectrum in the energy range $1.0 \times 10^{17}$ eV - $2.5 \times10^{19}$ eV is $E_\nu^2 dN_\nu/dE_\nu < 6.4 \times 10^{-9}~ {\rm GeV~ cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~ sr^{-1}}$.

Energy Estimation of Cosmic Rays with the Engineering Radio Array of the  Pierre Auger Observatory

  The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is part of the Pierre AugerObservatory and is used to detect the radio emission of cosmic-ray air showers.These observations are compared to the data of the surface detector stations ofthe Observatory, which provide well-calibrated information on the cosmic-rayenergies and arrival directions. The response of the radio stations in the 30to 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction ofthe incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area isdetermined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolatedusing a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries dueto interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components.The spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement ofthe energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in theAERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV airshower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy-- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energyestimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against thesurface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimatorscales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherentemission. We find an energy resolution of the radio reconstruction of 22% forthe data set and 17% for a high-quality subset containing only events with atleast five radio stations with signal.

Measurement of the Radiation Energy in the Radio Signal of Extensive Air  Showers as a Universal Estimator of Cosmic-Ray Energy

  We measure the energy emitted by extensive air showers in the form of radioemission in the frequency range from 30 to 80 MHz. Exploiting the accurateenergy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we obtain a radiation energy of15.8 \pm 0.7 (stat) \pm 6.7 (sys) MeV for cosmic rays with an energy of 1 EeVarriving perpendicularly to a geomagnetic field of 0.24 G, scalingquadratically with the cosmic-ray energy. A comparison with predictions fromstate-of-the-art first-principle calculations shows agreement with ourmeasurement. The radiation energy provides direct access to the calorimetricenergy in the electromagnetic cascade of extensive air showers. Comparison withour result thus allows the direct calibration of any cosmic-ray radio detectoragainst the well-established energy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

The Eleventh and Twelfth Data Releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey:  Final Data from SDSS-III

  The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took datafrom 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original andan upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infraredhigh-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the datafrom SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes DataRelease 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and DataRelease 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all dataincluded in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing.Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million newspectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation SpectroscopicSurvey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples thenumber of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO)Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radialvelocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial VelocityExoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measuredabundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of theSloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey;2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imagedover 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five millionastronomical spectra.
