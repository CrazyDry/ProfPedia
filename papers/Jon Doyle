Detecting Reflected Light from Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets with  the Kepler Photometer

  NASA's Kepler Mission promises to detect transiting Earth-sized planets inthe habitable zones of solar-like stars. In addition, it will be poised todetect the reflected light component from close-in extrasolar giant planets(CEGPs) similar to 51 Peg b. Here we use the DIARAD/SOHO time series along withmodels for the reflected light signatures of CEGPs to evaluate Kepler's abilityto detect such planets. We examine the detectability as a function of stellarbrightness, stellar rotation period, planetary orbital inclination angle, andplanetary orbital period, and then estimate the total number of CEGPs thatKepler will detect over its four year mission. The analysis shows thatintrinsic stellar variability of solar-like stars is a major obstacle todetecting the reflected light from CEGPs. Monte Carlo trials are used toestimate the detection threshold required to limit the total number of expectedfalse alarms to no more than one for a survey of 100,000 stellar light curves.Kepler will likely detect 100-760 51 Peg b-like planets by reflected light withorbital periods up to 7 days.

Bayesian Neural Networks for Genetic Association Studies of Complex  Disease

  Discovering causal genetic variants from large genetic association studiesposes many difficult challenges. Assessing which genetic markers are involvedin determining trait status is a computationally demanding task, especially inthe presence of gene-gene interactions. A non-parametric Bayesian approach inthe form of a Bayesian neural network is proposed for use in analyzing geneticassociation studies. Demonstrations on synthetic and real data reveal they areable to efficiently and accurately determine which variants are involved indetermining case-control status. Using graphics processing units (GPUs) thetime needed to build these models is decreased by several orders of magnitude.In comparison with commonly used approaches for detecting genetic interactions,Bayesian neural networks perform very well across a broad spectrum of possiblegenetic relationships while having the computational efficiency needed tohandle large datasets.

Observational Limits on Terrestrial-Sized Inner Planets Around the CM  Draconis System Using the Photometric Transit Method with a Matched-Filter  Algorithm

  A lightcurve of the eclipsing binary CM Draconis has been analyzed for thepresence of transits of planets of size >= 2.5 Earth-radii (Re), with periodsof 60 days or less, and in co-planar orbits around the binary system. About 400million model lightcurves, representing transits from planets with periodsranging from 7 to 60 days, have been matched/correlated against these data.This process we call the "transit detection algorithm" or TDA. The resulting`transit-statistics' for each planet candidate allow the quantification ofdetection probabilities, and of false alarm rates.  Our current lightcurve of CM Dra has a coverage of 1014 hours with 26,043individual points, at a photometric precision between 0.2% and 0.7%. Planetssignificantly larger then 3Re would constitute a `supra-noise' detection, andfor periods of 60 days or less, they would have been detected with aprobability of 90%. `Subnoise' detections of smaller planets are moreconstrained. For example, 2.5 Re planets with 10-day periods or less would havebeen detected with an 80% probability. The necessity for predicted observationsis illustrated with the nine top planet candidates that emerged from our TDAanalysis. They are the planet candidates with the highest transit-statisticsfrom the 1994-1998 observing seasons and, for them, transits for the 1999observing season were predicted. Of the seven candidates that were thenobservationally tested in 1999, all were ruled out except one, which needsfurther observational confirmation. We conclude that the photometric transitmethod is a viable way to search for relatively small, inner extrasolar planetswith moderate-sized telescopes using CCD photometry with a matching-filteranalysis.

Fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Using GPU Computing

  In recent years, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm has been foundto work more efficiently compared to other popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) methods (such as random walk Metropolis-Hastings) in generating samplesfrom a posterior distribution. A general framework for HMC based on the use ofgraphical processing units (GPUs) is shown to greatly reduce the computing timeneeded for Bayesian inference. The most expensive computational tasks in HMCare the evaluation of the posterior kernel and computing its gradient withrespect to the parameters of interest. One of primary goals of this article toshow that by expressing each of these tasks in terms of simple matrix orelement-wise operations and maintaining persistent objects in GPU memory, thecomputational time can be drastically reduced. By using GPU objects to performthe entire HMC simulation, most of the latency penalties associated withtransferring data from main to GPU memory can be avoided. Thus, the proposedcomputational framework is conceptually very simple, but also is general enoughto be applied to most problems that use HMC sampling. For clarity ofexposition, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in thehigh-dimensional setting on a standard statistical model - multinomialregression. Using GPUs, analyses of data sets that were previously intractablefor fully Bayesian approaches due to the prohibitively high computational costare now feasible.

Assessing Achievability of Queries and Constraints

  Assessing and improving the quality of data in data-intensive systems arefundamental challenges that have given rise to numerous applications targetingtransformation and cleaning of data. However, while schema design, datacleaning, and data migration are nowadays reasonably well understood inisolation, not much attention has been given to the interplay between the toolsthat address issues in these areas. Our focus is on the problem of determiningwhether there exist sequences of data-transforming procedures that, whenapplied to the (untransformed) input data, would yield data satisfying theconditions required for performing the task in question. Our goal is to developa framework that would address this problem, starting with the relationalsetting.  In this paper we abstract data-processing tools as black-box procedures. Thisabstraction describes procedures by a specification of which parts of thedatabase might be modified by the procedure, as well as by the constraints thatspecify the required states of the database before and after applying theprocedure. We then proceed to study fundamental algorithmic questions arisingin this context, such as understanding when one can guarantee that sequences ofprocedures apply to original or transformed data, when they succeed atimproving the data, and when knowledge bases can represent the outcomes ofprocedures. Finally, we turn to the problem of determining whether theapplication of a sequence of procedures to a database results in thesatisfaction of properties specified by either queries or constraints. We showthat this problem is decidable for some broad and realistic classes ofprocedures and properties, even when procedures are allowed to alter the schemaof instances.

Kepler Eclipsing Binary Stars. I. Catalog and Principal Characterization  of 1879 Eclipsing Binaries in the First Data Release

  The Kepler space mission is devoted to finding Earth-size planets inhabitable zones orbiting other stars. Its large, 105-deg field-of-view featuresover 156,000 stars that are observed continuously to detect and characterizeplanet transits. Yet this high-precision instrument holds great promise forother types of objects as well. Here we present a comprehensive catalog ofeclipsing binary stars observed by Kepler in the first 44 days of operation,the data which are publicly available through MAST as of 6/15/2010. The catalogcontains 1879 unique objects. For each object we provide its Kepler ID (KID),ephemeris (BJD0, P0), morphology type, physical parameters (Teff, log g,E(B-V), crowding), and principal parameters (T2/T1, q, fillout factor and sin ifor overcontacts, and T2/T1, (R1+R2)/a, e sin(w), e cos(w), and sin i fordetached binaries). We present statistics based on the determined periods andmeasure an average occurence rate of eclipsing binaries to be ~1.2% across theKepler field. We further discuss the distribution of binaries as function ofgalactic latitude, and thoroughly explain the application of artificialintelligence to obtain principal parameters in a matter of seconds for thewhole sample. The catalog was envisioned to serve as a bridge between the nowpublic Kepler data and the scientific community interested in eclipsing binarystars.

Kepler Eclipsing Binary Stars. II. 2165 Eclipsing Binaries in the Second  Data Release

  The Kepler Mission provides nearly continuous monitoring of ~156 000 objectswith unprecedented photometric precision. Coincident with the first datarelease, we presented a catalog of 1879 eclipsing binary systems identifiedwithin the 115 square degree Kepler FOV. Here, we provide an updated catalogaugmented with the second Kepler data release which increases the baselinenearly 4-fold to 125 days. 386 new systems have been added, ephemerides andprinciple parameters have been recomputed. We have removed 42 previouslycataloged systems that are now clearly recognized as short-period pulsatingvariables and another 58 blended systems where we have determined that theKepler target object is not itself the eclipsing binary. A number ofinteresting objects are identified. We present several exemplary cases: 4 EBsthat exhibit extra (tertiary) eclipse events; and 8 systems that show cleareclipse timing variations indicative of the presence of additional bodies boundin the system. We have updated the period and galactic latitude distributiondiagrams. With these changes, the total number of identified eclipsing binarysystems in the Kepler field-of-view has increased to 2165, 1.4% of the Keplertarget stars.

Spin-Orbit Alignment for the Circumbinary Planet Host Kepler-16A

  Kepler-16 is an eccentric low-mass eclipsing binary with a circumbinarytransiting planet. Here we investigate the angular momentum of the primarystar, based on Kepler photometry and Keck spectroscopy. The primary star'srotation period is 35.1 +/- 1.0 days, and its projected obliquity with respectto the stellar binary orbit is 1.6 +/- 2.4 degrees. Therefore the three largestsources of angular momentum---the stellar orbit, the planetary orbit, and theprimary's rotation---are all closely aligned. This finding supports a formationscenario involving accretion from a single disk. Alternatively, tides may haverealigned the stars despite their relatively wide separation (0.2 AU), ahypothesis that is supported by the agreement between the measured rotationperiod and the "pseudosynchronous" period of tidal evolution theory. Therotation period, chromospheric activity level, and fractional light variationssuggest a main-sequence age of 2-4 Gyr. Evolutionary models of low-mass starscan match the observed masses and radii of the primary and secondary stars towithin about 3%.

Kepler-16: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet

  We report the detection of a planet whose orbit surrounds a pair of low-massstars. Data from the Kepler spacecraft reveal transits of the planet acrossboth stars, in addition to the mutual eclipses of the stars, giving preciseconstraints on the absolute dimensions of all three bodies. The planet iscomparable to Saturn in mass and size, and is on a nearly circular 229-dayorbit around its two parent stars. The eclipsing stars are 20% and 69% asmassive as the sun, and have an eccentric 41-day orbit. The motions of allthree bodies are confined to within 0.5 degree of a single plane, suggestingthat the planet formed within a circumbinary disk.

The Neptune-Sized Circumbinary Planet Kepler-38b

  We discuss the discovery and characterization of the circumbinary planetKepler-38b. The stellar binary is single-lined, with a period of 18.8 days, andconsists of a moderately evolved main-sequence star (M_A = 0.949 +/- 0.059solar masses and R_A = 1.757 +/- 0.034 solar radii) paired with a low-mass star(M_B = 0.249 +/- 0.010 solar masses and R_B = 0.2724 +/- 0.0053 solar radii) ina mildly eccentric (e=0.103) orbit. A total of eight transits due to acircumbinary planet crossing the primary star were identified in the Keplerlight curve (using Kepler Quarters 1 through 11), from which a planetary periodof 105.595 +/- 0.053 days can be established. A photometric dynamical model fitto the radial velocity curve and Kepler light curve yields a planetary radiusof 4.35 +/- 0.11 Earth radii, or 1.12 +/- 0.03 Neptune radii. Since the planetis not sufficiently massive to observably alter the orbit of the binary fromKeplerian motion, we can only place an upper limit on the mass of the planet of122 Earth masses (7.11 Neptune masses or 0.384 Jupiter masses) at 95%confidence. This upper limit should decrease as more Kepler data becomeavailable.

Kepler-47: A Transiting Circumbinary Multi-Planet System

  We report the detection of Kepler-47, a system consisting of two planetsorbiting around an eclipsing pair of stars. The inner and outer planets haveradii 3.0 and 4.6 times that of the Earth, respectively. The binary starconsists of a Sun-like star and a companion roughly one-third its size,orbiting each other every 7.45 days. With an orbital period of 49.5 days,eighteen transits of the inner planet have been observed, allowing a detailedcharacterization of its orbit and those of the stars. The outer planet'sorbital period is 303.2 days, and although the planet is not Earth-like, itresides within the classical "habitable zone", where liquid water could existon an Earth-like planet. With its two known planets, Kepler-47 establishes thatclose binary stars can host complete planetary systems.

Kepler-1647b: the largest and longest-period Kepler transiting  circumbinary planet

  We report the discovery of a new Kepler transiting circumbinary planet (CBP).This latest addition to the still-small family of CBPs defies the current trendof known short-period planets orbiting near the stability limit of binarystars. Unlike the previous discoveries, the planet revolving around theeclipsing binary system Kepler-1647 has a very long orbital period (~1100 days)and was at conjunction only twice during the Kepler mission lifetime. Due tothe singular configuration of the system, Kepler-1647b is not only thelongest-period transiting CBP at the time of writing, but also one of thelongest-period transiting planets. With a radius of 1.06+/-0.01 RJup it is alsothe largest CBP to date. The planet produced three transits in the light-curveof Kepler-1647 (one of them during an eclipse, creating a syzygy) andmeasurably perturbed the times of the stellar eclipses, allowing us to measureits mass to be 1.52+/-0.65 MJup. The planet revolves around an 11-day periodeclipsing binary consisting of two Solar-mass stars on a slightly inclined,mildly eccentric (e_bin = 0.16), spin-synchronized orbit. Despite having anorbital period three times longer than Earth's, Kepler-1647b is in theconservative habitable zone of the binary star throughout its orbit.

A Framework for Assessing Achievability of Data-Quality Constraints

  Assessing and improving the quality of data are fundamental challenges fordata-intensive systems that have given rise to applications targetingtransformation and cleaning of data. However, while schema design, datacleaning, and data migration are now reasonably well understood in isolation,not much attention has been given to the interplay between the tools addressingissues in these areas. We focus on the problem of determining whether theavailable data-processing procedures can be used together to bring about thedesired quality of the given data. For instance, consider an organizationintroducing new data-analysis tasks. Depending on the tasks, it may be apriority to determine whether the data can be processed and transformed usingthe available data-processing tools to satisfy certain properties or qualityassurances needed for the success of the task. Here, while the organization maycontrol some of its tools, some other tools may be external or proprietary,with only basic information available on how they process data. The problem isthen, how to decide which tools to apply, and in which order, to make the dataready for the new tasks?  Toward addressing this problem, we develop a new framework that abstractsdata-processing tools as black-box procedures with only some of the propertiesexposed, such as the applicability requirements, the parts of the data that theprocedure modifies, and the conditions that the data satisfy once the procedurehas been applied. We show how common tasks such as data cleaning and datamigration are encapsulated into our framework and, as a proof of concept, westudy basic properties of the framework for the case of procedures described bystandard relational constraints. While reasoning in this framework may becomputationally infeasible in general, we show that there exist well-behavedspecial cases with potential practical applications.

GAMA: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation

  The Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m Anglo-AustralianTelescope at Siding Spring Observatory. GAMA is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1Mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. The principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof Cold Dark Matter (CDM) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. We will measure (1) the Dark Matter Halo Mass Function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from Galaxy Stellar MassFunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). Additionally, GAMA will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: GALEX, VST, VISTA, WISE,HERSCHEL, GMRT and ASKAP. Together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (UV through Far-IR to radio) over the main SDSSspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. This databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

The Transiting Circumbinary Planets Kepler-34 and Kepler-35

  Most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". While long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of Kepler-16. Incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.However, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. Here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, Kepler-34 and Kepler-35. Each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.Kepler-34 orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, while Kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the Sun's mass) every 131 days. Due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. The observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies > ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million.

Characteristics of planetary candidates observed by Kepler, II: Analysis  of the first four months of data

  On 1 February 2011 the Kepler Mission released data for 156,453 starsobserved from the beginning of the science observations on 2 May through 16September 2009. There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit likesignatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars.Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separatedinto five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (radius < 1.25Earth radii), 288 super-Earth size (1.25 Earth radii < radius < 2 Earth radii),662 Neptune-size (2 Earth radii < radius < 6 Earth radii), 165 Jupiter-size (6Earth radii < radius < 15 Earth radii), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter(15 Earth radii < radius < 22 Earth radii). In the temperature rangeappropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes rangingfrom Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Five are less than twice thesize of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller thanNeptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidatesincreases to a peak at two to three times Earth-size and then declinesinversely proportional to area of the candidate. Our current best estimates ofthe intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting forgeometric and sensitivity biases, are 6% for Earth-size candidates, 7% forsuper-Earth size candidates, 17% for Neptune-size candidates, and 4% forJupiter-size candidates. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17%of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the candidatesare part of multi-candidate systems.

Kepler-22b: A 2.4 Earth-radius Planet in the Habitable Zone of a  Sun-like Star

  A search of the time-series photometry from NASA's Kepler spacecraft revealsa transiting planet candidate orbiting the 11th magnitude G5 dwarf KIC 10593626with a period of 290 days. The characteristics of the host star are wellconstrained by high-resolution spectroscopy combined with an asteroseismicanalysis of the Kepler photometry, leading to an estimated mass and radius of0.970 +/- 0.060 MSun and 0.979 +/- 0.020 RSun. The depth of 492 +/- 10ppm forthe three observed transits yields a radius of 2.38 +/- 0.13 REarth for theplanet. The system passes a battery of tests for false positives, includingreconnaissance spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and centroid motion. Afull BLENDER analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretationby showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarelymimic the observed shape of the transits. The final validation of the planet isprovided by 16 radial velocities obtained with HIRES on Keck 1 over a one yearspan. Although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and massdetermination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{\sigma} upper limitof 124 MEarth, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning thedesignation Kepler-22b. The radiative equilibrium temperature is 262K for aplanet in Kepler-22b's orbit. Although there is no evidence that Kepler-22b isa rocky planet, it is the first confirmed planet with a measured radius toorbit in the Habitable Zone of any star other than the Sun.

Planetary Candidates Observed by Kepler. VIII. A Fully Automated Catalog  With Measured Completeness and Reliability Based on Data Release 25

  We present the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) catalog of transitingexoplanets based on searching four years of Kepler time series photometry (DataRelease 25, Q1-Q17). The catalog contains 8054 KOIs of which 4034 are planetcandidates with periods between 0.25 and 632 days. Of these candidates, 219 arenew and include two in multi-planet systems (KOI-82.06 and KOI-2926.05), andten high-reliability, terrestrial-size, habitable zone candidates. This catalogwas created using a tool called the Robovetter which automatically vets theDR25 Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs, Twicken et al. 2016). The Robovetter alsovetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEscaused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discussesthe Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods lessthan 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transitsthat are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars isgreater than 85%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (thefraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) isgreater than 98%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and500 days around FGK dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7% complete and thecatalog is 50.5% reliable. The KOI catalog, the transit fits and all of thesimulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASAExoplanet Archive.
