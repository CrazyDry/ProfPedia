Maximizing the Spread of Cascades Using Network Design

  We introduce a new optimization framework to maximize the expected spread ofcascades in networks. Our model allows a rich set of actions that directlymanipulate cascade dynamics by adding nodes or edges to the network. Ourmotivating application is one in spatial conservation planning, where a cascademodels the dispersal of wild animals through a fragmented landscape. We proposea mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation that combines elements fromnetwork design and stochastic optimization. Our approach results in solutionswith stochastic optimality guarantees and points to conservation strategiesthat are fundamentally different from naive approaches.
