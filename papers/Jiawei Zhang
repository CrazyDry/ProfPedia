An Improved Procedure for Selecting the Profiles of Perfectly Matched  Layers

  The perfectly matched layers (PMLs), as a boundary termination over anunbounded spatial domain, are widely used in numerical simulations of wavepropagation problems. Given a set of discretization parameters, a procedure toselect the PML profiles based on minimizing the discrete reflectivity isestablished for frequency domain simulations. We, by extending the functionclass and adopting a direct search method, improve the former procedure fortraveling waves.

  In this paper, we prove the long-time existence and uniqueness of the conicalK\"ahler-Ricci flow with weak initial data which admits $L^{p}$ density forsome $p>1$ on Fano manifold. Furthermore, we study the convergence behavior ofthis kind of flow.

Cusp Kähler-Ricci flow on compact Kähler manifold

  In this paper, by limiting twisted conical K\"ahler-Ricci flows, we prove thelong-time existence and uniqueness of cusp K\"ahler-Ricci flow on compactK\"ahler manifold $M$ which carries a smooth hypersurface $D$ such that thetwisted canonical bundle $K_M+D$ is ample. Furthermore, we prove that this flowconverge to a unique cusp K\"ahler-Einstein metric.

Gradient Descent based Optimization Algorithms for Deep Learning Models  Training

  In this paper, we aim at providing an introduction to the gradient descentbased optimization algorithms for learning deep neural network models. Deeplearning models involving multiple nonlinear projection layers are verychallenging to train. Nowadays, most of the deep learning model training stillrelies on the back propagation algorithm actually. In back propagation, themodel variables will be updated iteratively until convergence with gradientdescent based optimization algorithms. Besides the conventional vanillagradient descent algorithm, many gradient descent variants have also beenproposed in recent years to improve the learning performance, includingMomentum, Adagrad, Adam, Gadam, etc., which will all be introduced in thispaper respectively.

The conical Kähler-Ricci flow on Fano manifolds

  In this paper, we study the long-term behavior of the conical K\"ahler-Ricciflow on Fano manifold $M$. First, based on our work of locally uniformregularity for the twisted K\"ahler-Ricci flows, we obtain a long-time solutionto the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flow by limiting a sequence of these twistedflows. Second, we study the uniform Perelman's estimates of the twistedK\"ahler-Ricci flows. After that, we prove that the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flowmust converge to a conical K\"ahler-Einstein metric if there exists one.

The conical complex Monge-Ampère equations on Kähler manifolds

  In this paper, by providing the uniform gradient estimates for a sequence ofthe approximating equations, we prove the existence, uniqueness and regularityof the conical parabolic complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation with weak initialdata. As an application, we prove a regularity estimates, that is, any$L^{\infty}$-solution of the conical complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation admits the$C^{2,\alpha,\beta}$-regularity.

Intertwined Viral Marketing through Online Social Networks

  Traditional viral marketing problems aim at selecting a subset of seed usersfor one single product to maximize its awareness in social networks. However,in real scenarios, multiple products can be promoted in social networks at thesame time. At the product level, the relationships among these products can bequite intertwined, e.g., competing, complementary and independent. In thispaper, we will study the "interTwined Influence Maximization" (i.e., TIM)problem for one product that we target on in online social networks, wheremultiple other competing/complementary/independent products are being promotedsimultaneously. The TIM problem is very challenging to solve due to (1) fewexisting models can handle the intertwined diffusion procedure of multipleproducts concurrently, and (2) optimal seed user selection for the targetproduct may depend on other products' marketing strategies a lot. To addressthe TIM problem, a unified greedy framework TIER (interTwined InfluenceEstimatoR) is proposed in this paper. Extensive experiments conducted on fourdifferent types of real-world social networks demonstrate that TIER canoutperform all the comparison methods with significant advantages in solvingthe TIM problem.

Learning Fully Convolutional Networks for Iterative Non-blind  Deconvolution

  In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional networks for iterativenon-blind deconvolution We decompose the non-blind deconvolution problem intoimage denoising and image deconvolution. We train a FCNN to remove noises inthe gradient domain and use the learned gradients to guide the imagedeconvolution step. In contrast to the existing deep neural network basedmethods, we iteratively deconvolve the blurred images in a multi-stageframework. The proposed method is able to learn an adaptive image prior, whichkeeps both local (details) and global (structures) information. Bothquantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate thatthe proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms interms of quality and speed.

Gated Fusion Network for Single Image Dehazing

  In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to directly restore a clearimage from a hazy input. The proposed algorithm hinges on an end-to-endtrainable neural network that consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoderis exploited to capture the context of the derived input images, while thedecoder is employed to estimate the contribution of each input to the finaldehazed result using the learned representations attributed to the encoder. Theconstructed network adopts a novel fusion-based strategy which derives threeinputs from an original hazy image by applying White Balance (WB), ContrastEnhancing (CE), and Gamma Correction (GC). We compute pixel-wise confidencemaps based on the appearance differences between these different inputs toblend the information of the derived inputs and preserve the regions withpleasant visibility. The final dehazed image is yielded by gating the importantfeatures of the derived inputs. To train the network, we introduce amulti-scale approach such that the halo artifacts can be avoided. Extensiveexperimental results on both synthetic and real-world images demonstrate thatthe proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-artalgorithms.

GADAM: Genetic-Evolutionary ADAM for Deep Neural Network Optimization

  Deep neural network learning can be formulated as a non-convex optimizationproblem. Existing optimization algorithms, e.g., Adam, can learn the modelsfast, but may get stuck in local optima easily. In this paper, we introduce anovel optimization algorithm, namely GADAM (Genetic-Evolutionary Adam). GADAMlearns deep neural network models based on a number of unit models generationsby generations: it trains the unit models with Adam, and evolves them to thenew generations with genetic algorithm. We will show that GADAM can effectivelyjump out of the local optima in the learning process to obtain bettersolutions, and prove that GADAM can also achieve a very fast convergence.Extensive experiments have been done on various benchmark datasets, and thelearning results will demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the GADAMalgorithm.

On Deep Ensemble Learning from a Function Approximation Perspective

  In this paper, we propose to provide a general ensemble learning frameworkbased on deep learning models. Given a group of unit models, the proposed deepensemble learning framework will effectively combine their learning results viaa multilayered ensemble model. In the case when the unit model mathematicalmappings are bounded, sigmoidal and discriminatory, we demonstrate that thedeep ensemble learning framework can achieve a universal approximation of anyfunctions from the input space to the output space. Meanwhile, to achieve sucha performance, the deep ensemble learning framework also impose a strictconstraint on the number of involved unit models. According to the theoreticproof provided in this paper, given the input feature space of dimension d, therequired unit model number will be 2d, if the ensemble model involves onesingle layer. Furthermore, as the ensemble component goes deeper, the number ofrequired unit model is proved to be lowered down exponentially.

Deep Loopy Neural Network Model for Graph Structured Data Representation  Learning

  Existing deep learning models may encounter great challenges in handlinggraph structured data. In this paper, we introduce a new deep learning modelfor graph data specifically, namely the deep loopy neural network.Significantly different from the previous deep models, inside the deep loopyneural network, there exist a large number of loops created by the extensiveconnections among nodes in the input graph data, which makes model learning aninfeasible task. To resolve such a problem, in this paper, we will introduce anew learning algorithm for the deep loopy neural network specifically. Insteadof learning the model variables based on the original model, in the proposedlearning algorithm, errors will be back-propagated through the edges in a groupof extracted spanning trees. Extensive numerical experiments have been done onseveral real-world graph datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate theeffectiveness of both the proposed model and the learning algorithm in handlinggraph data.

Reconciled Polynomial Machine: A Unified Representation of Shallow and  Deep Learning Models

  In this paper, we aim at introducing a new machine learning model, namelyreconciled polynomial machine, which can provide a unified representation ofexisting shallow and deep machine learning models. Reconciled polynomialmachine predicts the output by computing the inner product of the featurekernel function and variable reconciling function. Analysis of several concretemodels, including Linear Models, FM, MVM, Perceptron, MLP and Deep NeuralNetworks, will be provided in this paper, which can all be reduced to thereconciled polynomial machine representations. Detailed analysis of thelearning error by these models will also be illustrated in this paper based ontheir reduced representations from the function approximation perspective.

GEN Model: An Alternative Approach to Deep Neural Network Models

  In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach, namely GEN (GeneticEvolution Network) Model, to the deep learning models. Instead of building onesingle deep model, GEN adopts a genetic-evolutionary learning strategy to builda group of unit models generations by generations. Significantly different fromthe wellknown representation learning models with extremely deep structures,the unit models covered in GEN are of a much shallower architecture. In thetraining process, from each generation, a subset of unit models will beselected based on their performance to evolve and generate the child models inthe next generation. GEN has significant advantages compared with existing deeprepresentation learning models in terms of both learning effectiveness,efficiency and interpretability of the learning process and learned results.Extensive experiments have been done on diverse benchmark datasets, and theexperimental results have demonstrated the outstanding performance of GENcompared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods in both effectiveness ofefficiency.

Ultra-low Hysteresis in Giant Magnetocaloric Mn1-xVxFe(P,Si,B) Compounds

  Large thermal hysteresis in the MnFe(P, Si, B) system hinders the heatexchange rate and thus limits the magnetocaloric applications at highfrequencies. Substitution of Mn by V in Mn1-xVxFe0.95P0.593Si0.33B0.077 andMn1-xVxFe0.95P0.563Si0.36B0.077 alloys was found to reduce the thermalhysteresis due to a decrease in the latent heat. Introducing V increases boththe field-induced transition temperature shift and the magnetic moment performula unit. Thus, a decease in the thermal hysteresis is obtained withoutlosing the giant magnetocaloric effect. In consequence, an ultralow hysteresis(0.7 K) and a giant adiabatic temperature change of 2.3 K were achieved, whichmakes these alloys promising candidates for commercial magnetic refrigeratorusing permanent magnets.

CA3Net: Contextual-Attentional Attribute-Appearance Network for Person  Re-Identification

  Person re-identification aims to identify the same pedestrian acrossnon-overlapping camera views. Deep learning techniques have been applied forperson re-identification recently, towards learning representation ofpedestrian appearance. This paper presents a novel Contextual-AttentionalAttribute-Appearance Network (CA3Net) for person re-identification. The CA3Netsimultaneously exploits the complementarity between semantic attributes andvisual appearance, the semantic context among attributes, visual attention onattributes as well as spatial dependencies among body parts, leading todiscriminative and robust pedestrian representation. Specifically, an attributenetwork within CA3Net is designed with an Attention-LSTM module. Itconcentrates the network on latent image regions related to each attribute aswell as exploits the semantic context among attributes by a LSTM module. Anappearance network is developed to learn appearance features from the fullbody, horizontal and vertical body parts of pedestrians with spatialdependencies among body parts. The CA3Net jointly learns the attribute andappearance features in a multi-task learning manner, generating comprehensiverepresentation of pedestrians. Extensive experiments on two challengingbenchmarks, i.e., Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets, have demonstrated theeffectiveness of the proposed approach.

Stability of the conical Kähler-Ricci flows on Fano manifolds

  In this paper, we study the stability of the conical K\"ahler-Ricci flows onFano manifolds. That is, if there exists a conical K\"ahler-Einstein metricwith cone angle $2\pi\beta$ along the divisor, then for any $\beta'$sufficiently close to $\beta$, the corresponding conical K\"ahler-Ricci flowconverges to a conical K\"ahler-Einstein metric with cone angle $2\pi\beta'$along the divisor. Here, we only use the condition that the Log Mabuchi energyis bounded from below. This is a weaker condition than the properness that wehave adopted to study the convergence before. As corollaries, we give parabolicproofs of Donaldson's openness theorem and his existence conjecture for theconical K\"ahler-Einstein metrics with small cone angles.

MDU-Net: Multi-scale Densely Connected U-Net for biomedical image  segmentation

  Radiologist is "doctor's doctor", biomedical image segmentation plays acentral role in quantitative analysis, clinical diagnosis, and medicalintervention. In the light of the fully convolutional networks (FCN) and U-Net,deep convolutional networks (DNNs) have made significant contributions inbiomedical image segmentation applications. In this paper, based on U-Net, wepropose MDUnet, a multi-scale densely connected U-net for biomedical imagesegmentation. we propose three different multi-scale dense connections for Ushaped architectures encoder, decoder and across them. The highlights of ourarchitecture is directly fuses the neighboring different scale feature mapsfrom both higher layers and lower layers to strengthen feature propagation incurrent layer. Which can largely improves the information flow encoder, decoderand across them. Multi-scale dense connections, which means containing shorterconnections between layers close to the input and output, also makes muchdeeper U-net possible. We adopt the optimal model based on the experiment andpropose a novel Multi-scale Dense U-Net (MDU-Net) architecture withquantization. Which reduce overfitting in MDU-Net for better accuracy. Weevaluate our purpose model on the MICCAI 2015 Gland Segmentation dataset(GlaS). The three multi-scale dense connections improve U-net performance by upto 1.8% on test A and 3.5% on test B in the MICCAI Gland dataset. Meanwhile theMDU-net with quantization achieves the superiority over U-Net performance by upto 3% on test A and 4.1% on test B.

Twisted and conical Kähler-Ricci soliton on Fano manifolds

  In this paper, we consider the twisted K\"ahler-Ricci soliton, and show thatthe existence of twisted K\"ahler-Ricci soliton with semi-positive twistingform is closely related to the properness of some energy functionals. We alsoconsider the conical K\"ahler-Ricci soliton, and obtain some existence results.In particular, under some assumptions on the divisor and $\alpha$-invariant, weget the properness of the modified log K-energy and the existence of conicalK\"ahler-Ricci soliton with suitable cone angle.

Bandwidth broadening of X-ray free electron laser pulses with the  natural gradient of planar undulator

  Besides the target to pursue the narrow bandwidth X-ray pulses, the largebandwidth free-electron laser pulses are also strongly demanded to satisfy awide range of scientific user experiments. In this paper, using thetransversely tilt beam enabled by deflecting cavity and/or corrugatedstructure, the potential of large bandwidth X-ray free-electron lasersgeneration with the natural gradient of the planar undulator are discussed.Simulations confirm the theoretical prediction, and X-ray free-electron laserbandwidth indicates an increase of one order of magnitude with the optimizedparameters.

Learning to Hallucinate Face Images via Component Generation and  Enhancement

  We propose a two-stage method for face hallucination. First, we generatefacial components of the input image using CNNs. These components represent thebasic facial structures. Second, we synthesize fine-grained facial structuresfrom high resolution training images. The details of these structures aretransferred into facial components for enhancement. Therefore, we generatefacial components to approximate ground truth global appearance in the firststage and enhance them through recovering details in the second stage. Theexperiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably againststate-of-the-art methods

Atomic inner-shell radiation seeded free-electron lasers

  In order to effectively improve the output quality of X-ray free electronlaser (XFEL), we theoretically propose an XFEL scheme seeded by atomicinner-shell laser. As well known, an atomic inner-shell laser based on neutralatoms and pumped by an XFEL has been experimentally demonstrated, whichproduced sub-femtosecond X-ray pulses with increased temporal coherence. Itshows that, by using the inner-shell laser as a seed to modulate the electronbunch, very stable and almost fully-coherent short-wavelength XFEL pulses canbe generated. The proposed scheme holds promising prospects in X-raywavelengths, and even shorter.

Predicting Social Links for New Users across Aligned Heterogeneous  Social Networks

  Online social networks have gained great success in recent years and many ofthem involve multiple kinds of nodes and complex relationships. Among theserelationships, social links among users are of great importance. Many existinglink prediction methods focus on predicting social links that will appear inthe future among all users based upon a snapshot of the social network. Inreal-world social networks, many new users are joining in the service everyday. Predicting links for new users are more important. Different fromconventional link prediction problems, link prediction for new users are morechallenging due to the following reasons: (1) differences in informationdistributions between new users and the existing active users (i.e., oldusers); (2) lack of information from the new users in the network. We propose alink prediction method called SCAN-PS (Supervised Cross Aligned Networks linkprediction with Personalized Sampling), to solve the link prediction problemfor new users with information transferred from both the existing active usersin the target network and other source networks through aligned accounts. Weproposed a within-target-network personalized sampling method to process theexisting active users' information in order to accommodate the differences ininformation distributions before the intra-network knowledge transfer. SCAN-PScan also exploit information in other source networks, where the user accountsare aligned with the target network. In this way, SCAN-PS could solve the coldstart problem when information of these new users is total absent in the targetnetwork.

Partial Network Alignment with Anchor Meta Path and Truncated Generic  Stable Matching

  To enjoy more social network services, users nowadays are usually involved inmultiple online social networks simultaneously. The shared users betweendifferent networks are called anchor users, while the remaining unshared usersare named as non-anchor users. Connections between accounts of anchor users indifferent networks are defined as anchor links and networks partially alignedby anchor links can be represented as partially aligned networks. In thispaper, we want to predict anchor links between partially aligned socialnetworks, which is formally defined as the partial network alignment problem.The partial network alignment problem is very difficult to solve because of thefollowing two challenges: (1) the lack of general features for anchor links,and (2) the "one-to-one$_\le$" (one to at most one) constraint on anchor links.To address these two challenges, a new method PNA (Partial Network Aligner) isproposed in this paper. PNA (1) extracts a set of explicit anchor adjacencyfeatures and latent topological features for anchor links based on the anchormeta path concept and tensor decomposition techniques, and (2) utilizes thegeneric stable matching to identify the non-anchor users to prune the redundantanchor links attached to them. Extensive experiments conducted on tworeal-world partially aligned social networks demonstrate that PNA can solve thepartial network alignment problem very well and outperform all the othercomparison methods with significant advantages.

Mutual Community Detection across Multiple Partially Aligned Social  Networks

  Community detection in online social networks has been a hot research topicin recent years. Meanwhile, to enjoy more social network services, usersnowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networkssimultaneously, some of which can share common information and structures.Networks that involve some common users are named as multiple "partiallyaligned networks". In this paper, we want to detect communities of multiplepartially aligned networks simultaneously, which is formally defined as the"Mutual Clustering" problem. The "Mutual Clustering" problem is verychallenging as it has two important issues to address: (1) how to preserve thenetwork characteristics in mutual community detection? and (2) how to utilizethe information in other aligned networks to refine and disambiguate thecommunity structures of the shared users? To solve these two challenges, anovel community detection method, MCD (Mutual Community Detector), is proposedin this paper. MCD can detect social community structures of users in multiplepartially aligned networks at the same time with full considerations of (1)characteristics of each network, and (2) information of the shared users acrossaligned networks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world partiallyaligned heterogeneous social networks demonstrate that MCD can solve the"Mutual Clustering" problem very well.

Organizational Chart Inference

  Nowadays, to facilitate the communication and cooperation among employees, anew family of online social networks has been adopted in many companies, whichare called the "enterprise social networks" (ESNs). ESNs can provide employeeswith various professional services to help them deal with daily work issues.Meanwhile, employees in companies are usually organized into differenthierarchies according to the relative ranks of their positions. The companyinternal management structure can be outlined with the organizational chartvisually, which is normally confidential to the public out of the privacy andsecurity concerns. In this paper, we want to study the IOC (Inference ofOrganizational Chart) problem to identify company internal organizational chartbased on the heterogeneous online ESN launched in it. IOC is very challengingto address as, to guarantee smooth operations, the internal organizationalcharts of companies need to meet certain structural requirements (about itsdepth and width). To solve the IOC problem, a novel unsupervised method Create(ChArT REcovEr) is proposed in this paper, which consists of 3 steps: (1)social stratification of ESN users into different social classes, (2)supervision link inference from managers to subordinates, and (3) consecutivesocial classes matching to prune the redundant supervision links. Extensiveexperiments conducted on real-world online ESN dataset demonstrate that Createcan perform very well in addressing the IOC problem.

Bicycle-Sharing System Analysis and Trip Prediction

  Bicycle-sharing systems, which can provide shared bike usage services for thepublic, have been launched in many big cities. In bicycle-sharing systems,people can borrow and return bikes at any stations in the service region veryconveniently. Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as ashort-distance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular publictransportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in theservice region, the bike usages can be quite skewed and imbalanced. Somestations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks forupcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enoughbikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential destinationsand arriving time of each individual trip beforehand can effectively help theservice providers schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper,we will study the individual trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharingsystems. To address the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing systemand analyze individuals' bike usage behaviors first. Based on the analysisresults, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration inference modelwill be introduced. Experiments conducted on a real-world bicycle-sharingsystem demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

3D Hand Pose Tracking and Estimation Using Stereo Matching

  3D hand pose tracking/estimation will be very important in the nextgeneration of human-computer interaction. Most of the currently availablealgorithms rely on low-cost active depth sensors. However, these sensors can beeasily interfered by other active sources and require relatively high powerconsumption. As a result, they are currently not suitable for outdoorenvironments and mobile devices. This paper aims at tracking/estimating handposes using passive stereo which avoids these limitations. A benchmark with18,000 stereo image pairs and 18,000 depth images captured from differentscenarios and the ground-truth 3D positions of palm and finger joints (obtainedfrom the manual label) is thus proposed. This paper demonstrates that theperformance of the state-of-the art tracking/estimation algorithms can bemaintained with most stereo matching algorithms on the proposed benchmark, aslong as the hand segmentation is correct. As a result, a novel stereo-basedhand segmentation algorithm specially designed for hand tracking/estimation isproposed. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithmis suitable for the state-of-the-art hand pose tracking/estimation algorithmsand the tracking quality is comparable to the use of active depth sensors underdifferent challenging scenarios.

LATTE: Application Oriented Social Network Embedding

  In recent years, many research works propose to embed the network structureddata into a low-dimensional feature space, where each node is represented as afeature vector. However, due to the detachment of embedding process withexternal tasks, the learned embedding results by most existing embedding modelscan be ineffective for application tasks with specific objectives, e.g.,community detection or information diffusion. In this paper, we propose studythe application oriented heterogeneous social network embedding problem.Significantly different from the existing works, besides the network structurepreservation, the problem should also incorporate the objectives of externalapplications in the objective function. To resolve the problem, in this paper,we propose a novel network embedding framework, namely the "appLicAtionorienTed neTwork Embedding" (Latte) model. In Latte, the heterogeneous networkstructure can be applied to compute the node "diffusive proximity" scores,which capture both local and global network structures. Based on these computedscores, Latte learns the network representation feature vectors by extendingthe autoencoder model model to the heterogeneous network scenario, which canalso effectively unite the objectives of network embedding and externalapplication tasks. Extensive experiments have been done on real-worldheterogeneous social network datasets, and the experimental results havedemonstrated the outstanding performance of Latte in learning therepresentation vectors for specific application tasks.

SEGEN: Sample-Ensemble Genetic Evolutional Network Model

  Deep learning, a rebranding of deep neural network research works, hasachieved a remarkable success in recent years. With multiple hidden layers,deep learning models aim at computing the hierarchical feature representationsof the observational data. Meanwhile, due to its severe disadvantages in dataconsumption, computational resources, parameter tuning costs and the lack ofresult explainability, deep learning has also suffered from lots of criticism.In this paper, we will introduce a new representation learning model, namely"Sample-Ensemble Genetic Evolutionary Network" (SEGEN), which can serve as analternative approach to deep learning models. Instead of building one singledeep model, based on a set of sampled sub-instances, SEGEN adopts agenetic-evolutionary learning strategy to build a group of unit modelsgenerations by generations. The unit models incorporated in SEGEN can be eithertraditional machine learning models or the recent deep learning models with amuch "narrower" and "shallower" architecture. The learning results of eachinstance at the final generation will be effectively combined from each unitmodel via diffusive propagation and ensemble learning strategies. From thecomputational perspective, SEGEN requires far less data, fewer computationalresources and parameter tuning efforts, but has sound theoreticinterpretability of the learning process and results. Extensive experimentshave been done on several different real-world benchmark datasets, and theexperimental results obtained by SEGEN have demonstrated its advantages overthe state-of-the-art representation learning models.

Social Network Fusion and Mining: A Survey

  Looking from a global perspective, the landscape of online social networks ishighly fragmented. A large number of online social networks have appeared,which can provide users with various types of services. Generally, theinformation available in these online social networks is of diverse categories,which can be represented as heterogeneous social networks (HSN) formally.Meanwhile, in such an age of online social media, users usually participate inmultiple online social networks simultaneously to enjoy more social networksservices, who can act as bridges connecting different networks together. Somultiple HSNs not only represent information in single network, but also fuseinformation from multiple networks.  Formally, the online social networks sharing common users are named as thealigned social networks, and these shared users who act like anchors aligningthe networks are called the anchor users. The heterogeneous informationgenerated by users' social activities in the multiple aligned social networksprovides social network practitioners and researchers with the opportunities tostudy individual user's social behaviors across multiple social platformssimultaneously. This paper presents a comprehensive survey about the latestresearch works on multiple aligned HSNs studies based on the broad learningsetting, which covers 5 major research tasks, i.e., network alignment, linkprediction, community detection, information diffusion and network embeddingrespectively.

EgoCoder: Intelligent Program Synthesis with Hierarchical Sequential  Neural Network Model

  Programming has been an important skill for researchers and practitioners incomputer science and other related areas. To learn basic programing skills, along-time systematic training is usually required for beginners. According to arecent market report, the computer software market is expected to continueexpanding at an accelerating speed, but the market supply of qualified softwaredevelopers can hardly meet such a huge demand. In recent years, the surge oftext generation research works provides the opportunities to address such adilemma through automatic program synthesis. In this paper, we propose to makeour try to solve the program synthesis problem from a data mining perspective.To address the problem, a novel generative model, namely EgoCoder, will beintroduced in this paper. EgoCoder effectively parses program code intoabstract syntax trees (ASTs), where the tree nodes will contain the programcode/comment content and the tree structure can capture the program logicflows. Based on a new unit model called Hsu, EgoCoder can effectively captureboth the hierarchical and sequential patterns in the program ASTs. Extensiveexperiments will be done to compare EgoCoder with the state-of-the-art textgeneration methods, and the experimental results have demonstrated theeffectiveness of EgoCoder in addressing the program synthesis problem.

Fake News Detection with Deep Diffusive Network Model

  In recent years, due to the booming development of online social networks,fake news for various commercial and political purposes has been appearing inlarge numbers and widespread in the online world. With deceptive words, onlinesocial network users can get infected by these online fake news easily, whichhas brought about tremendous effects on the offline society already. Animportant goal in improving the trustworthiness of information in online socialnetworks is to identify the fake news timely. This paper aims at investigatingthe principles, methodologies and algorithms for detecting fake news articles,creators and subjects from online social networks and evaluating thecorresponding performance. This paper addresses the challenges introduced bythe unknown characteristics of fake news and diverse connections among newsarticles, creators and subjects. Based on a detailed data analysis, this paperintroduces a novel automatic fake news credibility inference model, namelyFakeDetector. Based on a set of explicit and latent features extracted from thetextual information, FakeDetector builds a deep diffusive network model tolearn the representations of news articles, creators and subjectssimultaneously. Extensive experiments have been done on a real-world fake newsdataset to compare FakeDetector with several state-of-the-art models, and theexperimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.

A Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier for Linearly  Constrained Nonconvex Minimization

  Consider the minimization of a nonconvex differentiable function over apolyhedron. A popular primal-dual first-order method for this problem is toperform a gradient projection iteration for the augmented Lagrangian functionand then update the dual multiplier vector using the constraint residual.However, numerical examples show that this approach can exhibit "oscillation"and may not converge. In this paper, we propose a proximal alternatingdirection method of multipliers for the multi-block version of this problem. Adistinctive feature of this method is the introduction of a "smoothed" (i.e.,exponentially weighted) sequence of primal iterates, and the inclusion, at eachiteration, to the augmented Lagrangian function a quadratic proximal termcentered at the current smoothed primal iterate. The resulting proximalaugmented Lagrangian function is inexactly minimized (via a gradient projectionstep) at each iteration while the dual multiplier vector is updated using theresidual of the linear constraints. When the primal and dual stepsizes arechosen sufficiently small, we show that suitable "smoothing" can stabilize the"oscillation", and the iterates of the new proximal ADMM algorithm converge toa stationary point under some mild regularity conditions. Furthermore, when theobjective function is quadratic, we establish the linear convergence of thealgorithm. Our proof is based on a new potential function and a novel use oferror bounds.

Physical Design and Monte Carlo Simulations of a Space Radiation  Detector onboard the SJ-10 satellite

  A radiation gene box (RGB) onboard the SJ-10 satellite is a device carryingmice and drosophila cells to determine the biological effects of spaceradiation environment. The shielded fluxes of different radioactive sourceswere calculated and the linear energy transfers of gamma-rays, electrons,protons and alpha-particles in tissue were acquired using A-150tissue-equivalent plastic. Then, a conceptual model of a space radiationinstrument employing three semiconductor sub-detectors for deriving the chargedand uncharged radiation environment of the RGB was designed. The energydepositions in the three sub-detectors were classified into fifteen channels(bins) in an algorithm derived from the Monte Carlo method. The physicalfeasibility of the conceptual instrument was also verified by Monte Carlosimulations.

Ground-based verification and data processing of Yutu rover Active  Particle-induced X-ray Spectrometer

  The Active Particle-induced X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) is one of the payloadson board the Yutu rover of Chang'E-3 mission. In order to assess theinstrumental performance of APXS, a ground verification test was done for twounknown samples (basaltic rock, mixed powder sample). In this paper, thedetails of the experiment configurations and data analysis method arepresented. The results show that the elemental abundance of major elements canbe well determined by the APXS with relative deviations < 15 wt. % (detectiondistance = 30 mm, acquisition time = 30 min). The derived detection limit ofeach major element is inversely proportional to acquisition time and directlyproportional to detection distance, suggesting that the appropriate distanceshould be < 50mm.

Ideal Weyl semimetals in the chalcopyrites CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2 and  ZnPbAs2

  Weyl semimetals are new states of matter which feature novel Fermi arcs andexotic transport phenomena. Based on first-principles calculations, we reportthat the chalcopyrites CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2 and ZnPbAs2 are ideal Weylsemimetals, having largely separated Weyl points (~ 0.05/A) and uncovered Fermiarcs that are amenable to experimental detections. We also construct a minimaleffective model to capture the low-energy physics of this class of Weylsemimetals. Our discovery is a major step toward a perfect playground ofintriguing Weyl semimetals and potential applications for low-power andhigh-speed electronics.

BL-MNE: Emerging Heterogeneous Social Network Embedding through Broad  Learning with Aligned Autoencoder

  Network embedding aims at projecting the network data into a low-dimensionalfeature space, where the nodes are represented as a unique feature vector andnetwork structure can be effectively preserved. In recent years, more and moreonline application service sites can be represented as massive and complexnetworks, which are extremely challenging for traditional machine learningalgorithms to deal with. Effective embedding of the complex network data intolow-dimension feature representation can both save data storage space andenable traditional machine learning algorithms applicable to handle the networkdata. Network embedding performance will degrade greatly if the networks are ofa sparse structure, like the emerging networks with few connections. In thispaper, we propose to learn the embedding representation for a target emergingnetwork based on the broad learning setting, where the emerging network isaligned with other external mature networks at the same time. To solve theproblem, a new embedding framework, namely "Deep alIgned autoencoder basedeMbEdding" (DIME), is introduced in this paper. DIME handles the diverse linkand attribute in a unified analytic based on broad learning, and introduces themultiple aligned attributed heterogeneous social network concept to model thenetwork structure. A set of meta paths are introduced in the paper, whichdefine various kinds of connections among users via the heterogeneous link andattribute information. The closeness among users in the networks are defined asthe meta proximity scores, which will be fed into DIME to learn the embeddingvectors of users in the emerging network. Extensive experiments have been doneon real-world aligned social networks, which have demonstrated theeffectiveness of DIME in learning the emerging network embedding vectors.

Photon-counting Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry based on  up-conversion detector and fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer

  A direct-detection Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR) isproposed and demonstrated by using an up-conversion single-photon detector anda fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer (FFP-SI). Taking advantage of highsignal-to-noise ratio of the detector and high spectrum resolution of theFFP-SI, the Brillouin spectrum along a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) isrecorded on a multiscaler with a small data size directly. In contrast withconventional BOTDR adopting coherent detection, photon-counting BOTDR issimpler in structure and easier in data processing. In the demonstrationexperiment, characteristic parameters of the Brillouin spectrum including itspower, spectral width and frequency center are analyzed simultaneously along a10 km PMF at different temperature and stain conditions.

Symmetry-protected ideal Weyl semimetal in HgTe-class materials

  Ideal Weyl semimetals with all Weyl nodes exactly at the Fermi level and nocoexisting trivial Fermi surfaces in the bulk, similar to graphene, couldfeature deep physics such as exotic transport phenomena induced by the chiralanomaly. Here, we show that HgTe and half-Heusler compounds, under a broadrange of in-plane compressive strain, could be materials in nature realizingideal Weyl semimetals with four pairs of Weyl nodes and topological surfaceFermi arcs. Generically, we find that the HgTe-class materials with nontrivialband inversion and noncentrosymmetry provide a promising arena to realize idealWeyl semimetals. Such ideal Weyl semimetals could further provide a uniqueplatform to study emergent phenomena such as the interplay between ideal Weylfermions and superconductivity in the half-Heusler compound LaPtBi.

Micro-pulse upconversion Doppler lidar for wind and visibility detection  in the atmospheric boundary layer

  For the first time, a versatile, eyesafe, compact and direct detectionDoppler lidar is developed using upconversion single-photon detection method.An all-fiber and polarization maintaining architecture is realized to guaranteethe high optical coupling efficiency and the system stability. Usingintegrated-optic components, the conservation of etendue of the opticalreceiver is achieved by manufacturing a fiber-coupled periodically poledLithium niobate waveguide and an all-fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI).The so-called double-edge direct detection is implemented using asingle-channel FPI and a single upconversion detector, incorporatingtime-division multiplexing method. The relative error of the system is lowerthan 0.1% over 9 weeks. To show the robust of the system, atmospheric wind andvisibility over 48 hours are detected in the boundary layer. In theintercomparison experiments, lidar shows good agreement with the ultrasonicwind sensor (Vaisala windcap WMT52), with standard deviation of 1.04 m/s inspeed and 12.3{\deg} in direction.

Brillouin optical time domain reflectometry for fast detection of  dynamic strain incorporating double-edge technique

  For the first time, a direct detection BOTDR is demonstrated for distributeddynamic strain sensing incorporating double-edge technique, time-divisionmultiplexing technique and upconversion technique. The double edges arerealized by using the transmission curve and reflection curve of an all-fiberFabry-Perot interferometer (FPI). Benefiting from the low loss of the fiber at,the time-division multiplexing technique is performed to realize thedouble-edge technique by using only a single-channel FPI and only one piece ofa detector. In order to detect the weak spontaneous Brillouin backscatteringsignal efficiently, a fiber-coupled upconversion detector is adopted toupconvert the backscattering signal at 1548.1 nm to 863 nm, which is detectedby a Si-APD finally. In the experiment, dynamic strain disturbance up to1.9m{\epsilon} over 1.5 km of polarization maintaining fiber is detected at asampling rate of 30 Hz. An accuracy of 30{\mu}{\epsilon} and spatial resolutionof 0.6 m is realized.

Information-Propogation-Enhanced Neural Machine Translation by Relation  Model

  Even though sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation (NMT) model haveachieved state-of-art performance in the recent fewer years, but it is widelyconcerned that the recurrent neural network (RNN) units are very hard tocapture the long-distance state information, which means RNN can hardly findthe feature with long term dependency as the sequence becomes longer.Similarly, convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced into NMT forspeeding recently, however, CNN focus on capturing the local feature of thesequence; To relieve this issue, we incorporate a relation network into thestandard encoder-decoder framework to enhance information-propogation in neuralnetwork, ensuring that the information of the source sentence can flow into thedecoder adequately. Experiments show that proposed framework outperforms thestatistical MT model and the state-of-art NMT model significantly on two datasets with different scales.

Refining Source Representations with Relation Networks for Neural  Machine Translation

  Although neural machine translation (NMT) with the encoder-decoder frameworkhas achieved great success in recent times, it still suffers from somedrawbacks: RNNs tend to forget old information which is often useful and theencoder only operates through words without considering word relationship. Tosolve these problems, we introduce a relation networks (RN) into NMT to refinethe encoding representations of the source. In our method, the RN firstaugments the representation of each source word with its neighbors and reasonsall the possible pairwise relations between them. Then the sourcerepresentations and all the relations are fed to the attention module and thedecoder together, keeping the main encoder-decoder architecture unchanged.Experiments on two Chinese-to-English data sets in different scales both showthat our method can outperform the competitive baselines significantly.

Exploiting Investors Social Network for Stock Prediction in China's  Market

  Recent works have shown that social media platforms are able to influence thetrends of stock price movements. However, existing works have majorly focusedon the U.S. stock market and lacked attention to certain emerging countriessuch as China, where retail investors dominate the market. In this regard, asretail investors are prone to be influenced by news or other social media,psychological and behavioral features extracted from social media platforms arethought to well predict stock price movements in the China's market. Recentadvances in the investor social network in China enables the extraction of suchfeatures from web-scale data. In this paper, on the basis of tweets fromXueqiu, a popular Chinese Twitter-like social platform specialized forinvestors, we analyze features with regard to collective sentiment andperception on stock relatedness and predict stock price movements by employingnonlinear models. The features of interest prove to be effective in ourexperiments.

Liquid phase mass production of air-stable black  phosphorus/phospholipids nanocomposite with ultralow tunneling barrier

  Few-layer black phosphorus (FLBP), a recently discovered two-dimensionalsemiconductor, has attracted substantial attention in the scientific andtechnical communities due to its great potential in electronic andoptoelectronic applications. However, reactivity of FLBP flakes with ambientspecies limits its direct applications. Among various methods to passivate FLBPin ambient environment, nanocomposites mixing FLBP flakes with stable matrixmay be one of the most promising approaches for industry applications. Here, wereport a simple one-step procedure to mass produce air-stableFLBP/phospholipids nanocomposite in liquid phase. The resultant nanocompositeis found to have ultralow tunneling barrier for charge carriers which can bedescribed by an Efros-Shklovskii variable range hopping mechanism. Devices madefrom such mass-produced FLBP/phospholipids nanocomposite show highly stableelectrical conductivity and opto-electrical response in ambient conditions,indicating its promising applications in both electronic and optoelectronicapplications. This method could also be generalized to the mass production ofnanocomposites consisting of other air-sensitive two-dimensional materials,such as FeSe, NbSe2, WTe2, etc.

Cross-type Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Deep Multi-Task  Learning

  Motivation: State-of-the-art biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER)systems often require handcrafted features specific to each entity type, suchas genes, chemicals and diseases. Although recent studies explored using neuralnetwork models for BioNER to free experts from manual feature engineering, theperformance remains limited by the available training data for each entitytype. Results: We propose a multi-task learning framework for BioNER tocollectively use the training data of different types of entities and improvethe performance on each of them. In experiments on 15 benchmark BioNERdatasets, our multi-task model achieves substantially better performancecompared with state-of-the-art BioNER systems and baseline neural sequencelabeling models. Further analysis shows that the large performance gains comefrom sharing character- and word-level information among relevant biomedicalentities across differently labeled corpora.

Engineering topological phases in the Luttinger semimetal $α$-Sn

  $\alpha$-Sn is well known as a typical Luttinger semimetal with a quadraticband touching at the $\Gamma$ point. Based on the effective $k\cdot p$ analysisas well as first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that multipletopological phases with a rich diagram, including topological insulator, Diracsemimetal, and Weyl semimetal phases, can be induced and engineered in$\alpha$-Sn by external strains, magnetic fields, and circularly polarizedlight (CPL). Intriguingly, not only the conventional type-I Weyl nodes, butalso type-II Weyl nodes and double-Weyl nodes can be generated directly fromthe quadratic semimetal by applying a magnetic field or CPL. Our results applyequally well to other Luttinger semimetals with similar crystal and electronicstructures, and thus open an avenue for realizing and engineering multipletopological phases on a versatile platform.

r-Instance Learning for Missing People Tweets Identification

  The number of missing people (i.e., people who get lost) greatly increases inrecent years. It is a serious worldwide problem, and finding the missing peopleconsumes a large amount of social resources. In tracking and finding thesemissing people, timely data gathering and analysis actually play an importantrole. With the development of social media, information about missing peoplecan get propagated through the web very quickly, which provides a promising wayto solve the problem. The information in online social media is usually ofheterogeneous categories, involving both complex social interactions andtextual data of diverse structures. Effective fusion of these different typesof information for addressing the missing people identification problem can bea great challenge. Motivated by the multi-instance learning problem andexisting social science theory of "homophily", in this paper, we propose anovel r-instance (RI) learning model.

Refining Source Representations with Relation Networks for Neural  Machine Translation

  Although neural machine translation with the encoder-decoder framework hasachieved great success recently, it still suffers drawbacks of forgettingdistant information, which is an inherent disadvantage of recurrent neuralnetwork structure, and disregarding relationship between source words duringencoding step. Whereas in practice, the former information and relationship areoften useful in current step. We target on solving these problems and thusintroduce relation networks to learn better representations of the source. Therelation networks are able to facilitate memorization capability of recurrentneural network via associating source words with each other, this would alsohelp retain their relationships. Then the source representations and all therelations are fed into the attention component together while decoding, withthe main encoder-decoder framework unchanged. Experiments on several datasetsshow that our method can improve the translation performance significantly overthe conventional encoder-decoder model and even outperform the approachinvolving supervised syntactic knowledge.
