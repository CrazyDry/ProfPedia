Interplay of growth mode and thermally induced spin accumulation in  epitaxial Al/Co$_2$TiSi/Al and Al/Co$_2$TiGe/Al contacts

  The feasibility of thermally driven spin injectors built from half-metallicHeusler alloys inserted between aluminum leads was investigated by means of{\em ab initio} calculations of the thermodynamic equilibrium and electronictransport. We have focused on two main issues and found that: (i) the interfacebetween Al and the closely lattice-matched Heusler alloys of type Co$_2$Ti$Z$($Z=$ Si or Ge) is stable under various growth conditions; and (ii) theconventional and spin-dependent Seebeck coefficients in such heterojunctionsexhibit a strong dependence on both the spacer and the atomic composition ofthe Al/Heusler interface. The latter quantity gives a measure of the spinaccumulation and varies between $+8$~$\mu$V/K and $-3$~$\mu$V/K near $300$~K,depending on whether a Ti-Ge or a Co-Co plane makes the contact between Al andCo$_2$TiGe in the trilayer. Our results show that it is in principle possibleto tailor the spin-caloric effects by a targeted growth control of the samples.

Large morphological sensitivity of the magnetothermopower in Co/Cu  multilayered systems

  We present results of first-principles calculations on the transportproperties, both under an electric field or a temperature gradient, in theCo/Cu multilayered systems. The various effects brought about by the changes inthe morphological parameters, such as the number of repeats and the layerthickness, are discussed in a systematic way. Our calculations show that theSeebeck coefficient and the magnetothermopower (MTP) converge rather rapidlywith the number of Co repeats. In the range of thin Co layers, we find strongvariations in amplitude and sign of both the Seebeck coefficient and the MTP.These large variations, which have no correspondent in the(magneto)conductance, are shown to be the result of quantum well states presentin the minority spin channel of thin Co layers.

Native defects in the Co$_2$Ti$Z$ ($Z=$ Si, Ge, Sn) full Heusler alloys:  formation and influence on the thermoelectric properties

  We have performed first-principles investigations on the native defects inthe full Heusler alloys Co$_2$Ti$Z$ ($Z$ one of the group IV elements Si, Ge,Sn), determining their formation energies and how they influence the transportproperties. We find that Co vacancies (Vc) in all compounds and theTi$_\text{Sn}$ anti-site exhibit negative formation energies. The smallestpositive values occur for Co in excess on anti-sites (Co$_Z$ or Co$_\text{Ti}$)and for Ti$_Z$. The most abundant native defects were modeled as dilute alloys,treated with the coherent potential approximation in combination with themultiple-scattering theory Green function approach. The self-consistentpotentials determined this way were used to calculate the residual resistivityvia the Kubo-Greenwood formula and, based on its energy dependence, the Seebeckcoefficient of the systems. The latter is shown to depend significantly on thetype of defect, leading to variations that are related to subtle, spin-orbitcoupling induced, changes in the electronic structure above the half-metallicgap. Two of the systems, Vc$_\text{Co}$ and Co$_Z$, are found to exhibit anegative Seebeck coefficient. This observation, together with their lowformation energy, offers an explanation for the experimentally observednegative Seebeck coefficient of the Co$_2$Ti$Z$ compounds as being due tounintentionally created native defects.
