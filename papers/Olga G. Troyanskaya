Deep Supervised and Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network for  Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

  Predicting protein secondary structure is a fundamental problem in proteinstructure prediction. Here we present a new supervised generative stochasticnetwork (GSN) based method to predict local secondary structure with deephierarchical representations. GSN is a recently proposed deep learningtechnique (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013) to globally train deep generativemodel. We present the supervised extension of GSN, which learns a Markov chainto sample from a conditional distribution, and applied it to protein structureprediction. To scale the model to full-sized, high-dimensional data, likeprotein sequences with hundreds of amino acids, we introduce a convolutionalarchitecture, which allows efficient learning across multiple layers ofhierarchical representations. Our architecture uniquely focuses on predictingstructured low-level labels informed with both low and high-levelrepresentations learned by the model. In our application this corresponds tolabeling the secondary structure state of each amino-acid residue. We trainedand tested the model on separate sets of non-homologous proteins sharing lessthan 30% sequence identity. Our model achieves 66.4% Q8 accuracy on the CB513dataset, better than the previously reported best performance 64.9% (Wang etal., 2011) for this challenging secondary structure prediction problem.

Mapping Dynamic Histone Acetylation Patterns to Gene Expression in  Nanog-depleted Murine Embryonic Stem Cells

  Embryonic stem cells (ESC) have the potential to self-renew indefinitely andto differentiate into any of the three germ layers. The molecular mechanismsfor self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency and lineage specification arepoorly understood, but recent results point to a key role for epigeneticmechanisms. In this study, we focus on quantifying the impact of histone 3acetylation (H3K9,14ac) on gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells. Weanalyze genome-wide histone acetylation patterns and gene expression profilesmeasured over the first five days of cell differentiation triggered bysilencing Nanog, a key transcription factor in ESC regulation. We explore thetemporal and spatial dynamics of histone acetylation data and its correlationwith gene expression using supervised and unsupervised statistical models. On agenome-wide scale, changes in acetylation are significantly correlated tochanges in mRNA expression and, surprisingly, this coherence increases overtime. We quantify the predictive power of histone acetylation for geneexpression changes in a balanced cross-validation procedure. In an in-depthstudy we focus on genes central to the regulatory network of Mouse ESC,including those identified in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen and in thePluriNet, a computationally derived stem cell signature. We find that comparedto the rest of the genome, ESC-specific genes show significantly moreacetylation signal and a much stronger decrease in acetylation over time, whichis often not reflected in an concordant expression change. These results shedlight on the complexity of the relationship between histone acetylation andgene expression and are a step forward to dissect the multilayer regulatorymechanisms that determine stem cell fate.
