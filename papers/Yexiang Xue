Variable Elimination in the Fourier Domain

  The ability to represent complex high dimensional probability distributionsin a compact form is one of the key insights in the field of graphical models.Factored representations are ubiquitous in machine learning and lead to majorcomputational advantages. We explore a different type of compact representationbased on discrete Fourier representations, complementing the classical approachbased on conditional independencies. We show that a large class ofprobabilistic graphical models have a compact Fourier representation. Thistheoretical result opens up an entirely new way of approximating a probabilitydistribution. We demonstrate the significance of this approach by applying itto the variable elimination algorithm. Compared with the traditional bucketrepresentation and other approximate inference algorithms, we obtainsignificant improvements.

Solving Marginal MAP Problems with NP Oracles and Parity Constraints

  Arising from many applications at the intersection of decision making andmachine learning, Marginal Maximum A Posteriori (Marginal MAP) Problems unifythe two main classes of inference, namely maximization (optimization) andmarginal inference (counting), and are believed to have higher complexity thanboth of them. We propose XOR_MMAP, a novel approach to solve the Marginal MAPProblem, which represents the intractable counting subproblem with queries toNP oracles, subject to additional parity constraints. XOR_MMAP provides aconstant factor approximation to the Marginal MAP Problem, by encoding it as asingle optimization in polynomial size of the original problem. We evaluate ourapproach in several machine learning and decision making applications, and showthat our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art Marginal MAP solvers.

Phase-Mapper: An AI Platform to Accelerate High Throughput Materials  Discovery

  High-Throughput materials discovery involves the rapid synthesis,measurement, and characterization of many different but structurally-relatedmaterials. A key problem in materials discovery, the phase map identificationproblem, involves the determination of the crystal phase diagram from thematerials' composition and structural characterization data. We presentPhase-Mapper, a novel AI platform to solve the phase map identification problemthat allows humans to interact with both the data and products of AIalgorithms, including the incorporation of human feedback to constrain orinitialize solutions. Phase-Mapper affords incorporation of any spectraldemixing algorithm, including our novel solver, AgileFD, which is based on aconvolutive non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. AgileFD canincorporate constraints to capture the physics of the materials as well ashuman feedback. We compare three solver variants with previously proposedmethods in a large-scale experiment involving 20 synthetic systems,demonstrating the efficacy of imposing physical constrains using AgileFD.Phase-Mapper has also been used by materials scientists to solve a wide varietyof phase diagrams, including the previously unsolved Nb-Mn-V oxide system,which is provided here as an illustrative example.

XOR-Sampling for Network Design with Correlated Stochastic Events

  Many network optimization problems can be formulated as stochastic networkdesign problems in which edges are present or absent stochastically.Furthermore, protective actions can guarantee that edges will remain present.We consider the problem of finding the optimal protection strategy under abudget limit in order to maximize some connectivity measurements of thenetwork. Previous approaches rely on the assumption that edges are independent.In this paper, we consider a more realistic setting where multiple edges arenot independent due to natural disasters or regional events that make thestates of multiple edges stochastically correlated. We use Markov Random Fieldsto model the correlation and define a new stochastic network design framework.We provide a novel algorithm based on Sample Average Approximation (SAA)coupled with a Gibbs or XOR sampler. The experimental results on real roadnetwork data show that the policies produced by SAA with the XOR sampler havehigher quality and lower variance compared to SAA with Gibbs sampler.

Multi-Entity Dependence Learning with Rich Context via Conditional  Variational Auto-encoder

  Multi-Entity Dependence Learning (MEDL) explores conditional correlationsamong multiple entities. The availability of rich contextual informationrequires a nimble learning scheme that tightly integrates with deep neuralnetworks and has the ability to capture correlation structures amongexponentially many outcomes. We propose MEDL_CVAE, which encodes a conditionalmultivariate distribution as a generating process. As a result, the variationallower bound of the joint likelihood can be optimized via a conditionalvariational auto-encoder and trained end-to-end on GPUs. Our MEDL_CVAE wasmotivated by two real-world applications in computational sustainability: onestudies the spatial correlation among multiple bird species using the eBirddata and the other models multi-dimensional landscape composition and humanfootprint in the Amazon rainforest with satellite images. We show thatMEDL_CVAE captures rich dependency structures, scales better than previousmethods, and further improves on the joint likelihood taking advantage of verylarge datasets that are beyond the capacity of previous methods.

End-to-End Learning for the Deep Multivariate Probit Model

  The multivariate probit model (MVP) is a popular classic model for studyingbinary responses of multiple entities. Nevertheless, the computationalchallenge of learning the MVP model, given that its likelihood involvesintegrating over a multidimensional constrained space of latent variables,significantly limits its application in practice. We propose a flexible deepgeneralization of the classic MVP, the Deep Multivariate Probit Model (DMVP),which is an end-to-end learning scheme that uses an efficient parallel samplingprocess of the multivariate probit model to exploit GPU-boosted deep neuralnetworks. We present both theoretical and empirical analysis of the convergencebehavior of DMVP's sampling process with respect to the resolution of thecorrelation structure. We provide convergence guarantees for DMVP and ourempirical analysis demonstrates the advantages of DMVP's sampling compared withstandard MCMC-based methods. We also show that when applied to multi-entitymodelling problems, which are natural DMVP applications, DMVP trains fasterthan classical MVP, by at least an order of magnitude, captures richcorrelations among entities, and further improves the joint likelihood ofentities compared with several competitive models.

Deep Multi-Species Embedding

  Understanding how species are distributed across landscapes over time is afundamental question in biodiversity research. Unfortunately, most speciesdistribution models only target a single species at a time, despite strongecological evidence that species are not independently distributed. We proposeDeep Multi-Species Embedding (DMSE), which jointly embeds vectors correspondingto multiple species as well as vectors representing environmental covariatesinto a common high-dimensional feature space via a deep neural network. Appliedto bird observational data from the citizen science project \textit{eBird}, wedemonstrate how the DMSE model discovers inter-species relationships tooutperform single-species distribution models (random forests and SVMs) as wellas competing multi-label models. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefit ofusing a deep neural network to extract features within the embedding and showhow they improve the predictive performance of species distribution modelling.An important domain contribution of the DMSE model is the ability to discoverand describe species interactions while simultaneously learning the sharedhabitat preferences among species. As an additional contribution, we provide agraphical embedding of hundreds of bird species in the Northeast US.

Automated Phase Mapping with AgileFD and its Application to Light  Absorber Discovery in the V-Mn-Nb Oxide System

  Rapid construction of phase diagrams is a central tenet of combinatorialmaterials science with accelerated materials discovery efforts often hamperedby challenges in interpreting combinatorial x-ray diffraction datasets, whichwe address by developing AgileFD, an artificial intelligence algorithm thatenables rapid phase mapping from a combinatorial library of x-ray diffractionpatterns. AgileFD models alloying-based peak shifting through a novel expansionof convolutional nonnegative matrix factorization, which not only improves theidentification of constituent phases but also maps their concentration andlattice parameter as a function of composition. By incorporating Gibbs phaserule into the algorithm, physically meaningful phase maps are obtained withunsupervised operation, and more refined solutions are attained by injectingexpert knowledge of the system. The algorithm is demonstrated throughinvestigation of the V-Mn-Nb oxide system where decomposition of eight oxidephases, including two with substantial alloying, provides the first phase mapfor this pseudo-ternary system. This phase map enables interpretation ofhigh-throughput band gap data, leading to the discovery of new solar lightabsorbers and the alloying-based tuning of the direct-allowed band-gap energyof MnV2O6. The open-source family of AgileFD algorithms can be implemented intoa broad range of high throughput workflows to accelerate materials discovery.

Scalable Relaxations of Sparse Packing Constraints: Optimal Biocontrol  in Predator-Prey Network

  Cascades represent rapid changes in networks. A cascading phenomenon ofecological and economic impact is the spread of invasive species in geographiclandscapes. The most promising management strategy is often biocontrol, whichentails introducing a natural predator able to control the invading population,a setting that can be treated as two interacting cascades of predator and preypopulations. We formulate and study a nonlinear problem of optimal biocontrol:optimally seeding the predator cascade over time to minimize the harmful preypopulation. Recurring budgets, which typically face conservation organizations,naturally leads to sparse constraints which make the problem amenable toapproximation algorithms. Available methods based on continuous relaxationsscale poorly, to remedy this we develop a novel and scalable randomizedalgorithm based on a width relaxation, applicable to a broad class ofcombinatorial optimization problems. We evaluate our contributions in thecontext of biocontrol for the insect pest Hemlock Wolly Adelgid (HWA) ineastern North America. Our algorithm outperforms competing methods in terms ofscalability and solution quality, and finds near optimal strategies for thecontrol of the HWA for fine-grained networks -- an important problem incomputational sustainability.

End-to-End Refinement Guided by Pre-trained Prototypical Classifier

  Many real-world tasks involve identifying patterns from data satisfyingbackground or prior knowledge. In domains like materials discovery, due to theflaws and biases in raw experimental data, the identification of X-raydiffraction patterns (XRD) often requires a huge amount of manual work infinding refined phases that are similar to the ideal theoretical ones.Automatically refining the raw XRDs utilizing the simulated theoretical data isthus desirable. We propose imitation refinement, a novel approach to refineimperfect input patterns, guided by a pre-trained classifier incorporatingprior knowledge from simulated theoretical data, such that the refined patternsimitate the ideal data. The classifier is trained on the ideal simulated datato classify patterns and learns an embedding space where each class isrepresented by a prototype. The refiner learns to refine the imperfect patternswith small modifications, such that their embeddings are closer to thecorresponding prototypes. We show that the refiner can be trained in bothsupervised and unsupervised fashions. We further illustrate the effectivenessof the proposed approach both qualitatively and quantitatively in a digitrefinement task and an X-ray diffraction pattern refinement task in materialsdiscovery.

DESK: A Robotic Activity Dataset for Dexterous Surgical Skills Transfer  to Medical Robots

  Datasets are an essential component for training effective machine learningmodels. In particular, surgical robotic datasets have been key to many advancesin semi-autonomous surgeries, skill assessment, and training. Simulatedsurgical environments can enhance the data collection process by making itfaster, simpler and cheaper than real systems. In addition, combining data frommultiple robotic domains can provide rich and diverse training data fortransfer learning algorithms. In this paper, we present the DESK (DexterousSurgical Skill) dataset. It comprises a set of surgical robotic skillscollected during a surgical training task using three robotic platforms: theTaurus II robot, Taurus II simulated robot, and the YuMi robot. This datasetwas used to test the idea of transferring knowledge across different domains(e.g. from Taurus to YuMi robot) for a surgical gesture classification taskwith seven gestures. We explored three different scenarios: 1) No transfer, 2)Transfer from simulated Taurus to real Taurus and 3) Transfer from SimulatedTaurus to the YuMi robot. We conducted extensive experiments with threesupervised learning models and provided baselines in each of these scenarios.Results show that using simulation data during training enhances theperformance on the real robot where limited real data is available. Inparticular, we obtained an accuracy of 55% on the real Taurus data using amodel that is trained only on the simulator data. Furthermore, we achieved anaccuracy improvement of 34% when 3% of the real data is added into the trainingprocess.
