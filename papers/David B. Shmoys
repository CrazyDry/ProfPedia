Improving Christofides' Algorithm for the s-t Path TSP

  We present a deterministic (1+sqrt(5))/2-approximation algorithm for the s-t
path TSP for an arbitrary metric. Given a symmetric metric cost on n vertices
including two prespecified endpoints, the problem is to find a shortest
Hamiltonian path between the two endpoints; Hoogeveen showed that the natural
variant of Christofides' algorithm is a 5/3-approximation algorithm for this
problem, and this asymptotically tight bound in fact has been the best
approximation ratio known until now. We modify this algorithm so that it
chooses the initial spanning tree based on an optimal solution to the Held-Karp
relaxation rather than a minimum spanning tree; we prove this simple but
crucial modification leads to an improved approximation ratio, surpassing the
20-year-old barrier set by the natural Christofides' algorithm variant. Our
algorithm also proves an upper bound of (1+sqrt(5))/2 on the integrality gap of
the path-variant Held-Karp relaxation. The techniques devised in this paper can
be applied to other optimization problems as well: these applications include
improved approximation algorithms and improved LP integrality gap upper bounds
for the prize-collecting s-t path problem and the unit-weight graphical metric
s-t path TSP.


A Primal-Dual Approximation Algorithm for Min-Sum Single-Machine
  Scheduling Problems

  We consider the following single-machine scheduling problem, which is often
denoted $1||\sum f_{j}$: we are given $n$ jobs to be scheduled on a single
machine, where each job $j$ has an integral processing time $p_j$, and there is
a nondecreasing, nonnegative cost function $f_j(C_{j})$ that specifies the cost
of finishing $j$ at time $C_{j}$; the objective is to minimize $\sum_{j=1}^n
f_j(C_j)$. Bansal \& Pruhs recently gave the first constant approximation
algorithm with a performance guarantee of 16. We improve on this result by
giving a primal-dual pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm based on the recently
introduced knapsack-cover inequalities. The algorithm finds a schedule of cost
at most four times the constructed dual solution. Although we show that this
bound is tight for our algorithm, we leave open the question of whether the
integrality gap of the LP is less than 4. Finally, we show how the technique
can be adapted to yield, for any $\epsilon >0$, a $(4+\epsilon )$-approximation
algorithm for this problem.


Minimizing Multimodular Functions and Allocating Capacity in
  Bike-Sharing Systems

  The growing popularity of bike-sharing systems around the world has motivated
recent attention to models and algorithms for the effective operation of these
systems. Most of this literature focuses on their daily operation for managing
asymmetric demand. In this work, we consider the more strategic question of how
to (re-)allocate dock-capacity in such systems. We develop mathematical
formulations for variations of this problem (service performance over the
course of one day, long-run- average performance) and exhibit discrete convex
properties in associated optimization problems. This allows us to design a
practically fast polynomial-time allocation algorithm to compute optimal
solutions for this problem, which can also handle practically motivated
constraints, such as a limit on the number of docks moved in the system.
  We apply our algorithm to data sets from Boston, New York City, and Chicago
to investigate how different dock allocations can yield better service in these
systems. Recommendations based on our analysis have been adopted by system
operators in Boston and New York City. Beyond optimizing for improved quality
of service through better allocations, our results also quantify the reduction
in rebalancing achievable through strategically reallocating docks.
