A study of coherent and incoherent resonances in high intensity beams  using a linear Paul trap

  In this paper we present a quantitative measurement of the change infrequency (tune) with intensity of four transverse resonances in a highintensity Gaussian beam. Due to the non-linear space charge forces present inhigh intensity beams, particle motion cannot be analytically described. Insteadwe use the Simulator of Particle Orbit Dynamics (S-POD) and the Intense BeamExperiment (IBEX), two linear Paul traps, to experimentally replicate thesystem. In high intensity beams a coherent resonant response to both spacecharge and external field driven perturbations is possible, these coherentresonances are excited at a tune that differs by a factor $C_{m}$ from that ofthe incoherent resonance. By increasing the number of ions stored in the linearPaul trap and studying the location of four different resonances we extractprovisional values describing the change in tune of the resonance withintensity. These values are then compared to the $C_{m}$ factors for coherentresonances. We find that the $C_{m}$ factors do not accurately predict thelocation of resonances in high intensity Gaussian beams. Further insight intothe experiment is gained through simulation using Warp, a particle-in-cellcode.

Reconstruction of Initial Beam Conditions at the Exit of the DARHT II  Accelerator

  We consider a technique to determine the initial beam conditions of the DARHTII Accelerator by measuring the beam size under three different magnetictransport settings. This may be time gated to resolve the parameters as afunction of time within the 2000 nsec pulse. This technique leads to threeequations in three unknowns with solution giving the accelerator exit beamradius, tilt and emittance. We find that systematic errors cancel and so arenot a problem in unfolding the initial beam conditions. Random uncorrelatedshot to shot errors can be managed by one of three strategies: 1) make thetransport system optically de-magnifying; 2) average over many individualshots; or 3) make the random uncorrelated shot to shot errors sufficientlysmall. The high power of the DARHT II beam requires that the beam transportsystem leading to a radius measuring apparatus be optically magnifying. Thismeans that the shot to shot random errors must either be made small (less thanabout 1%) or that we average each of the three beam radius determinations overmany individual shots.

Laser cooling with a single laser beam and a planar diffractor

  A planar triplet of diffraction gratings is used to transform a single laserbeam into a four-beam tetrahedral magneto-optical trap. This `flat' pyramiddiffractor geometry is ideal for future microfabrication. We demonstrate thetechnique by trapping and subsequently sub-Doppler cooling 87Rb atoms to30microKelvin.

Cyclotrons for high-intensity beams

  This paper reviews the important physical and technological aspects ofcyclotrons for the acceleration of high-intensity beams. Special emphasis isgiven to the discussion of beam loss mechanisms and extraction schemes.

Effect of Beam-Plasma Instabilities on Accretion Disk Flares

  We show that a certain class of flare models for variability from accretiondisk coronae are subject to beam-plasma instabilities. These instabilities canprevent significant direct acceleration and greatly reduce the variable X-rayemission argued to arise via inverse Compton scattering involving relativisticelectrons in beams and soft photons from the disk.

Trapping of charged particles by Bessel beams

  There exist two well established methods to trap charged particles: thePenning trap and the Paul trap. The subject of this article is to present athird mechanism for trapping charged particles - trapping by beams ofelectromagnetic radiation. The essential role is played by the electric fieldconfiguration in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis (for nonrelativisticelectrons, the magnetic field is less important). Particles are confined to thevicinity of the minimum-energy points. In particular, for beams ofelectromagnetic radiation carrying orbital angular momentum such points lie onthe beam axis.

Dose Delivery Verification

  This paper focuses on some dosimetry aspects of proton therapy and pencilbeam scanning based on the experience accumulated at Paul ScherrerInstitute(PSI). The basic formalism for absolute dosimetry in proton therapy isoutlined and the two main techniques and equipment to perform the primary beammonitor chamber calibration are presented. Depth-dose curve and lateral beamwidth measurements are exposed and discussed in detail, with particularattention to the size of the ionization chamber and the characteristic ofscintillating-CCD dosimetry systems, respectively. It is also explained how theangular-spatial distribution of individual pencil beams can be determined inpractice. The equipment and the techniques for performingregularmachine-specific quality checks are focused on (i)output constancychecks, (ii)pencil beam position and size checks and (iii)beam energy checks.Finally, patient-specific verification is addressed.

Neutrino oscillations in structured matter

  A layered material structure in a monochromatic neutrino beam producesinterference effects that could be used for the measurement of features of theneutrino mass matrix. The phenomenon would be most useful at high energies.

Longitudinal Losses Due to Breathing Mode Excitation in Radiofrequency  Linear Accelerators

  Transverse breathing mode oscillations in a particle beam can couple energyinto longitudinal oscillations in a bunch of finite length and causesignificant losses. We develop a model that illustrates this effect and explorethe dependence on mismatch size, space-charge tune depression, longitudinalfocusing strength, bunch length, and RF bucket length.

Dosimetric and Biologic Differences in Flattened and  Flattening-Filter-Free Beam Treatment Plans

  Purpose: To quantitatively compare the dosimetric and biologic differences intreatment plans from flattened and flattening-filter-free (FFF) beam for threeanatomic cancer sites. Methods and Materials: Treatment plans with staticintensity-modulated radiotherapy beams and volumetric modulated arc therapybeams were generated for 13 patients for both the flattened beam and the FFFbeam of the TrueBeam system. Beam energies of 6 MV and 10 MV were chosen forplanning. A total of 104 treatment plans were generated in 13 patients. Inorder to analyze the biological effectiveness of treatment plans, dose volumehistograms (DVH) were utilized. Flattened and FFF beam plans are quantitativelycompared. Results: In head and neck cases, for VMAT plans, dose reduction inthe FFF beam plans compared to the flattened beam in left cochlea, rightsubmandibular gland and right parotid gland reached up to 2.36 Gy, 1.21 Gy and1.45 Gy, respectively. Similarly, for static IMRT plans, the dose reduction ofthe FFF beam plans compared to the flattened beam plans for the same organsreached up to 0.34 Gy, 1.36 Gy and 1.46 Gy, respectively. Overall, for head andneck, the FFF beam plans achieved mean dose reduction of up to 5%, 7% and 9%,respectively for above organs at risk. For lung and prostate cases, the FFFbeams provided lower or comparable NTCP values to organ-at-risk (OAR) comparedto the flattened beam for all plans. Conclusions: In general, we observedtreatment plans utilizing FFF beams can improve dose sparing to OARs withoutcompromising the target coverage. Significant dose sparing effect is obtainedfor head and neck cancer cases, especially for the cases with relatively largefield sizes (about 16x20 cm^2). For lung and prostate cases, compared to theflattened beam, the FFF beam based treatment plans provide lower or comparabledose to most OARs.

The high-intensity hyperon beam at CERN

  A high-intensity hyperon beam was constructed at CERN to deliver Sigma- toexperiment WA89 at the Omega facility and operated from 1989 to 1994. The setupallowed rapid changeover between hyperon and conventional hadron beamconfigurations. The beam provided a Sigma-flux of 1.4 x 10^5 per burst at meanmomenta between 330 and 345 Gev/c, produced by about 3 x 10^10 protons of 450GeV/c . At the experiment target the beam had a Sigma-/pi- ratio close to 0.4and a size of 1.6 x 3.7 cm^2. The beam particle trajectories and their momentawere measured with a scintillating fibre hodoscope in the beam channel and asilicon microstrip detector at the exit of the channel. A fast transitionradiation detector was used to identify the pion component of the beam.

Feedback control of optical beam spatial profiles using thermal lensing

  A method for active control of the spatial profile of a laser beam usingadaptive thermal lensing is described. A segmented electrical heater was usedto generate thermal gradients across a transmissive optical element, resultingin a controllable thermal lens. The segmented heater also allows the generationof cylindrical lenses, and provides the capability to steer the beam in bothhorizontal and vertical planes. Using this device as an actuator, a feedbackcontrol loop was developed to stabilize the beam size and position.

Manipulation of a continuous beam of molecules by light pulses

  We experimentally observe the action of multiple light pulses on thetransverse motion of a continuous beam of fullerenes. The light potential isgenerated by non-resonant ultra-short laser pulses in perpendicular spatialoverlap with the molecule beam. We observe a small but clear enhancement of thenumber of molecules in the center fraction of the molecular beam. Relativelylow light intensity and short laser pulse duration prevent the molecule fromfragmentation and ionization. Experimental results are confirmed by Monte Carlotrajectory simulations.

Low-energy neutrino beams with an upgraded Fermilab proton driver

  The beam properties of low-energy neutrino beams that would be possible at anupgraded 2 MW Fermilab 8 GeV Proton Source are described. In particular threeoptions are considered; (i) a MiniBooNE-like beam using a conventional neutrinohorn, (ii) a decay at rest neutrino source, and (iii) a neutrino beamdownstream of a solenoid decay channel. In all three cases the fluxes aresufficiently large to provide an interesting physics program. Some physicsexamples are considered.

Investigation of microwave radiation from a compressed beam of ions  using generalized Planck radiation law

  An ion-beam compressed by an external electric force is characterized by aunique non-equilibrium distribution function. This is a special case of Tsallisdistribution with entropy index q=2, which allows the system to possessappreciably low thermal energy. The thermal radiation by such compressedion-beam has been investigated in this work. As the system is non extensive,Planck law of radiation has been modified using Tsallis thermostatistics forthe investigation of the system. The average energy of radiation has beenderived by introducing the non extensive partition function in the statisticalrelation of internal energy. The spectral energy density, spectral radiationand total radiation power have also been computed. It is seen that a microwaveradiation will be emitted by the compressed ion-beam. The fusion energy gain Q(ratio of the output fusion power to the power consumed by the system)according to the proposed scheme (R. K. Paul 2015) using compressed ion-beam byelectric field will not change significantly as the radiated power is verysmall.

Diagnostic criterion for crystallized beams

  Small ion crystals in a Paul trap are stable even in the absence of lasercooling. Based on this theoretically and experimentally well-established factwe propose the following diagnostic criterion for establishing the presence ofa crystallized beam: Absence of heating following the shut-down of all coolingdevices. The validity of the criterion is checked with the help of detailednumerical simulations.

Interpreting Near-side Correlations

  Recent data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC show strong near-sidecorrelations extending over several units of rapidity. This ridge-likecorrelation exhibits an abrupt onset with collision centrality. In this talk, Iargue that the centrality and beam-energy dependence of these near-anglecorrelations could provide access to information about the Quark Gluon Plasmaphase boundary and the Equation of State of nuclear matter. A beam-energy-scanat RHIC will better reveal the true source of these correlations and should bea high priority at RHIC.

Directional pulse propagation in beam, rod, pipe, and disk geometries

  I derive directional wave equations useful for pulses propagating in beam,rod, pipe, and disk geometries by using a cylindrical coordinate system; thescheme works equally well for either long multi-cycle or single-cycleultrashort pulses. This is achieved by means of a factorization procedure thatconveniently generates exact bi-directional and first order wave equationsafter the selection of propagation direction - either axial, radial, or evenangular. I then discuss how to reduce these to a uni-directional form, anddiscuss the necessary approximation, which is essentially a paraxialapproximation as appropriately generalized to the specific geometry.

Optical design of split-beam photonic crystal nanocavities

  We design high quality factor photonic crystal nanobeam cavities formed bytwo mechanically isolated cantilevers. These "split-beam" cavities have aphysical gap at the center, allowing mechanical excitations of one or both ofthe cavity halves. They are designed by analyzing the optical band structuresand mode profiles of waveguides perforated by elliptical holes and rectangulargaps, and are predicted to support optical resonances with quality factorsexceeding 1E6 at wavelengths of ~ 1.6 um.

Towards Verifying Nonlinear Integer Arithmetic

  We eliminate a key roadblock to efficient verification of nonlinear integerarithmetic using CDCL SAT solvers, by showing how to construct short resolutionproofs for many properties of the most widely used multiplier circuits. Suchshort proofs were conjectured not to exist. More precisely, we give n^{O(1)}size regular resolution proofs for arbitrary degree 2 identities on array,diagonal, and Booth multipliers and quasipolynomial- n^{O(\log n)} size proofsfor these identities on Wallace tree multipliers.

Readout Electronics for the CALICE ECAL and Tile HCAL

  The aims of the CALICE test beam program are presented. The proposedelectronics readout system for the CALICE ECAL is described. It is apurpose-built VME-based, unbuffered system.

'Digital' Electron Diffraction - Seeing the Whole Picture

  The advantages of convergent beam electron diffraction for symmetrydetermination at the scale of a few nm are well known. In practice, theapproach is often limited due to the restriction on the angular range of theelectron beam imposed by the small Bragg angle for high energy electrondiffraction, i.e. a large convergence angle of the incident beam results inoverlapping information in the diffraction pattern. Techniques have beengenerally available since the 1980s which overcome this restriction forindividual diffracted beams, by making a compromise between illuminated areaand beam convergence. Here, we describe a simple technique which overcomes allof these problems using computer control, giving electron diffraction data overa large angular range for many diffracted beams from the volume given by afocused electron beam (typically a few nm or less). The increase in the amountof information significantly improves ease of interpretation and widens theapplicability of the technique, particularly for thin materials or those withlarger lattice parameters.

Robust Location-Aided Beam Alignment in Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO

  Location-aided beam alignment has been proposed recently as a potentialapproach for fast link establishment in millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO(mMIMO) communications. However, due to mobility and other imperfections in theestimation process, the spatial information obtained at the base station (BS)and the user (UE) is likely to be noisy, degrading beam alignment performance.In this paper, we introduce a robust beam alignment framework in order toexhibit resilience with respect to this problem. We first recast beam alignmentas a decentralized coordination problem where BS and UE seek coordination onthe basis of correlated yet individual position information. We formulate theoptimum beam alignment solution as the solution of a Bayesian team decisionproblem. We then propose a suite of algorithms to approach optimality withreduced complexity. The effectiveness of the robust beam alignment procedure,compared with classical designs, is then verified on simulation settings withvarying location information accuracies.

Beam Transport Systems for Particle Therapy

  The beam transport system between accelerator and patient treatment locationin a particle therapy facility is described. After some general layout aspectsthe major beam handling tasks of this system are discussed. These are energyselection, an optimal transport of the particle beam to the beam deliverydevice and the gantry, a device that is able to rotate a beam delivery systemaround the patient, so that the tumour can be irradiated from almost anydirection. Also the method of pencil beam scanning is described and how this isimplemented within a gantry. Using this method the particle dose is spread overthe tumour volume to the prescribed dose distribution.

Shining a Gluon Beam Through Quark-Gluon Plasma

  We compute the energy density radiated by a quark undergoing circular motionin strongly coupled $\mathcal N = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. If itwere in vacuum, this quark would radiate a beam of strongly coupled radiationwhose angular distribution has been characterized and is very similar to thatof synchrotron radiation produced by an electron in circular motion inelectrodynamics. Here, we watch this beam of gluons getting quenched by thestrongly coupled plasma. We find that a beam of gluons of momenta $\sim q \gg\pi T$ is attenuated rapidly, over a distance $\sim q^{1/3} (\pi T)^{-4/3}$ ina plasma with temperature $T$. As the beam propagates through the plasma at thespeed of light, it sheds trailing sound waves with momenta $\lesssim \pi T$.Presumably these sound waves would thermalize in the plasma if they were nothit soon after their production by the next pulse of gluons from thelighthouse-like rotating quark. At larger and larger $q$, the trailing soundwave becomes less and less prominent. The outward going beam of gluon radiationitself shows no tendency to spread in angle or to shift toward largerwavelengths, even as it is completely attenuated. In this regard, the behaviorof the beam of gluons that we analyze is reminiscent of the behavior of jetsproduced in heavy ion collisions at the LHC that lose a significant fraction oftheir energy without appreciable change in their angular distribution or theirmomentum distribution as they plow through the strongly coupled quark-gluonplasma produced in these collisions.

Electron beam induced current in the high injection regime

  Electron beam induced current (EBIC) is a powerful technique which measuresthe charge collection efficiency of photovoltaics with sub-micron spatialresolution. The exciting electron beam results in a high generation ratedensity of electron-hole pairs, which may drive the system into nonlinearregimes. An analytic model is presented which describes the EBIC response whenthe {\it total} electron-hole pair generation rate exceeds the rate at whichcarriers are extracted by the photovoltaic cell, and charge accumulation andscreening occur. The model provides a simple estimate of the onset of the highinjection regime in terms of the material resistivity and thickness, andprovides a straightforward way to predict the EBIC lineshape in the highinjection regime. The model is verified by comparing its predictions tonumerical simulations in 1 and 2 dimensions. Features of the experimental data,such as the magnitude and position of maximum collection efficiency versuselectron beam current, are consistent with the 3 dimensional model.

Teleportation with the entangled states of a beam splitter

  We present a teleportation protocol based upon the entanglement produced fromFock states incident onto a beam splitter of arbitrary transmissivity. Theteleportation fidelity is analysed, its trends being explained fromconsideration of a beam splitter's input/output characteristics.

Low-energy muons via frictional cooling

  Low-energy muon beams are useful for a range of physics experiments. Weconsider the production of low-energy muon beams with small energy spreadsusing frictional cooling. As the input beam, we take a surface muon source suchas that at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Simulations show that the efficiency oflow energy muon production can potentially be raised to 1%, which issignificantly higher than that of current schemes.

Slow and velocity-tunable beams of metastable He$_2$ by multistage  Zeeman deceleration

  Metastable helium molecules (He$_2^*$) have been generated by striking adischarge in a supersonic expansion of helium gas from a pulsed valve. Whenoperating the pulsed valve at room temperature, 77K, and 10K, the mean velocityof the supersonic beam was measured to be 1900m/s, 980m/s, and 530m/s,respectively. A 55-stage Zeeman decelerator operated in a phase-stable mannerwas then used to further reduce the beam velocity and tune it in the rangebetween 100 and 150m/s. The internal-state distribution of the deceleratedsample was established by photoionization spectroscopy.

Excitation of radiationless anapole mode of isotropic dielectric  nanoparticles with tightly focused radially polarized beam

  A high index dielectric nano-sphere can be excited and yet remainradiationless. A method to excite the non-radiating anapole mode of a highindex isotropic dielectric nanosphere is presented. With tightly focusedradially polarized beam illumination, the main-contributing electric dipolemode and magnetic modes can be zero with only a weak electric quadruplecontributing to the total scattering. Further, with a standing waveillumination formed by two counter-propagating focused radially polarized beamunder $4\pi$ configuration, the ideal radiationless ananpole can be excited.

Scattering studies with the DATURA beam telescope

  High-precision particle tracking devices allow for two-dimensional analysesof the material budget distribution of particle detectors and their periphery.In this contribution, the material budget of different targets is reconstructedfrom the width of the angular distribution of scattered beam particle at asample under test. Electrons in the GeV-range serve as beam particles carryingenough momentum to traverse few millimetre thick targets whilst offeringsufficient deflection for precise measurement. Reference measurements of thescattering angle distribution of targets of known thicknesses are presentedthat serve as calibration techniques required for tomographic reconstructionsof inhomogeneous objects.

The Mechanical Design for the Darht-II Downstream Beam Transport Line

  This paper describes the mechanical design of the downstream beam transportline for the second axis of the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test (DARHTII) Facility. The DARHT-II project is a collaboration between LANL, LBNL andLLNL. DARHT II is a 20-MeV, 2000-Amperes, 2-msec linear induction acceleratordesigned to generate short bursts of x-rays for the purpose of radiographingdense objects. The down-stream beam transport line is approximately 20-meterlong region extending from the end of the accelerator to the bremsstrahlungtarget. Within this proposed transport line there are 15 conventional solenoid,quadrupole and dipole magnets; as well as several speciality magnets, whichtransport and focus the beam to the target and to the beam dumps. There are twohigh power beam dumps, which are designed to absorb 80-kJ per pulse duringaccelerator start-up and operation. Aspects of the mechanical design of theseelements are presented.

Summary of working group g: beam material interaction

  For the first time, the workshop on High-Intensity and High-Brightness HadronBeams (HB2010), held at Morschach, Switzerland and organized by the PaulScherrer Institute, included a Working group dealing with the interactionbetween beam and material. Due to the high power beams of existing and futurefacilities, this topic is already of great relevance for such machines and isexpected to become even more important in the future. While more specializedworkshops related to topics of radiation damage, activation or thermo -mechanical calculations, already exist, HB2010 provided the occasion to discussthe interplay of these topics, focusing on components like targets, beam dumpsand collimators, whose reliability are crucial for a user facility. Inaddition, a broader community of people working on a variety of issues relatedto the operation of accelerators could be informed and their interest sparked.

Medical Physics Commissioning

  The medical commissioning is an important step to bring a particle gantryinto clinical operation for tumour treatments. This involves theparametrization and characterization of all relevant systems including the beamdelivery, the patient table, the imaging systems and the connection to allrequired software components. This article is limited to necessary tasks forthe beam delivery system of a pencil beam scanning system. Usually thecommissioning starts with the characterization of the unscanned beam and thecalibration of the beam energy. The following steps are the parametrization ofthe scanning system, the commissioning of the beam position monitoring systemand characterization of the spot size, all requiring precisions better than 1mm. The commissioning effort for these tasks depends also on the gantrytopology. Finally, the calibration of the dose measurement system ensures thatany dose distribution can be delivered with an absolute precision better than1%.

The DESY II Test Beam Facility

  DESY Hamburg operates a test beam facility with three independent beam linesat the DESY II synchrotron. It is world-wide one of very few facilitiesproviding test beams in the GeV range. To this end, it offers electron/positronbeams with user-selectable momenta from 1-6 GeV/c. The available infrastructurefor the users is unique, including a high field solenoidal magnet andpermanently installed high-precision pixel beam telescopes. This publicationgives a detailed description of the facility, the available infrastructure, andthe simulated and measured performance.

Type-II Zeeman slowing: Characterization and comparison to conventional  radiative beam slowing schemes

  We describe a novel Zeeman slowing method reported in (Petzold et al (2018New J. Phys. 20 042001)) and compare it to conventional radiative beam slowingschemes. The scheme is designed to work on a type-II level structure making itparticularly attractive for radiative beam slowing of molecules. Working on theD$_{1}$-line of atomic $^{39}$K, we demonstrate efficient slowing of an atomicbeam from $\mathrm{400 \, m \, s^{-1}}$ down to $\mathrm{35 \, m \, s^{-1}}$with a final flux of $3.3 \cdot 10^{9} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. Wegive experimental details and compare our results to other establishedradiative slowing schemes in atomic and molecular physics. We find type-IIZeeman slowing to outperform white-light slowing commonly used in molecularbeam slowing and to be comparably efficient as traditional type-I Zeemanslowing being the standard beam slowing technique in atomic physics.

Precise On-line Position Measurement for Particle Therapy

  An on-line beam position monitoring and regular beam stability tests are ofutmost importance for the Quality Assurance (QA) of the patient treatment atany particle therapy facility. The Gantry$\hspace{0.5 mm}2$ at the PaulScherrer Institute uses a strip ionization chamber for the on-line beamposition verification. The design of the strip chamber placed in the beam infront of the patient allows for a small beam penumbra in order to achieve ahigh-quality lateral beam delivery. The position error of 1 mm in a lateralplane (plane perpendicular to the beam direction) can result in a doseinhomogeneity of more than $5 \%$. Therefore the goal of Gantry 2 commissioningwas to reach a sub-millimeter level of the reconstruction accuracy in order tobring a dose uncertainty to a level of $1 \%$. In fact, we observed that forbeams offered by Gantry 2 signal profiles in a lateral plane can bereconstructed with a precision of 0.1 mm. This is a necessary criterion toperform a reliable patient treatment. The front end electronics and the wholedata processing sequence have been optimized for minimizing the dead time inbetween two consecutive spots to about 2 ms: the charge collection is performedin about 1 ms, read-out takes place in about 100 $\mu$s while data verificationand logging are completed in less than 1 ms.

Evolution of a beam dynamics model for the transport lines in a proton  therapy facility

  Despite the fact that the first-order beam dynamics models allow anapproximated evaluation of the beam properties, their contribution is essentialduring the conceptual design of an accelerator or beamline. However, during thecommissioning some of their limitations appear in the comparison againstmeasurements. The extension of the linear model to higher order effects is,therefore, demanded. In this paper, the effects of particle-matter interactionhave been included in the model of the transport lines in the proton therapyfacility at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Switzerland. To improve theperformance of the facility, a more precise model was required and has beendeveloped with the multi-particle open source beam dynamics code called OPAL(Object oriented Particle Accelerator Library). In OPAL, the Monte Carlosimulations of Coulomb scattering and energy loss are performed seamless withthe particle tracking. Beside the linear optics, the influence of the passiveelements (e.g. degrader, collimators, scattering foils and air gaps) on thebeam emittance and energy spread can be analysed in the new model. This allowsfor a significantly improved precision in the prediction of beam transmissionand beam properties. The accuracy of the OPAL model has been confirmed bynumerous measurements.

High-power liquid-lithium jet target for neutron production

  A compact Liquid-Lithium Target (LiLiT) was built and tested with ahigh-power electron gun at Soreq Nuclear Research Center. The lithium target,to be bombarded by the high-intensity proton beam of the Soreq Applied ResearchAccelerator Facility (SARAF), will constitute an intense source of neutronsproduced by the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction for nuclear astrophysics research and as apilot setup for accelerator-based Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). Theliquid-lithium jet target acts both as neutron-producing target and beam dumpby removing the beam thermal power (>5 kW, >1 MW/cm3) with fast transport. Thetarget was designed based on a thermal model, accompanied by a detailedcalculation of the 7Li(p,n) neutron yield, energy distribution and angulardistribution. Liquid lithium is circulated through the target loop at ~200oCand generates a stable 1.5 mm-thick film flowing at a velocity up to 7 m/s ontoa concave supporting wall. Electron beam irradiation demonstrated that theliquid-lithium target can dissipate electron power areal densities of > 4kW/cm2 and volume power density of ~ 2 MW/cm3 at a lithium flow of ~4 m/s whilemaintaining stable temperature and vacuum conditions. The LiLiT setup ispresently in online commissioning stage for high-intensity proton beamirradiation (1.91- 2.5 MeV, 1-2 mA) at SARAF.

Design and Simulation of a High Frequency High Power Rf Extraction  Device Using a Dielectric-Loaded Waveguide

  We consider the use of a dielectric-loaded structure to extract rf energyfrom a high current electron drive beam as a power source for a high energytwo-beam accelerator. This represents an alternative technique which we show tohave some significant advantages over the use of the currently proposedcorrugated metal structures as power extraction devices. We discuss aparticular design that will extract high power rf (0.1 -- 1 GW) from a highcurrent drive beam. Rf generation and transport in this class of devices havealready been demonstrated at lower frequencies. We discuss the designparameters for 15 and 30 GHz dielectric transfer structures and some possibleexperiments.

Studies of Particle Acceleration by an Active Microwave Medium

  The PASER is potentially a very attractive method for particle acceleration,in which energy from an active medium is transferred to a charged particlebeam. The effect is similar to the action of a maser or laser with thestimulated emission of radiation being produced by the virtual photons in theelectromagnetic field of the beam. We have been investigating the possibilityof developing a demonstration PASER operating at X-band. The less restrictivebeam transport and device dimensional tolerances required for working at X-bandrather than optical frequencies as well as the widespread application of X-bandhardware in accelerator technology all contribute to the attractiveness ofperforming a PASER demonstration experiment in this frequency range. Key tothis approach is the availability of a new class of active materials thatexhibit photoinduced electron spin polarization. We will report on the statusof active material development and measurements, numerical simulations, andprogress towards a planned microwave PASER acceleration experiment at theArgonne Wakefield Accelerator facility.

Absolute absorption on the rubidium D lines: comparison between theory  and experiment

  We study the Doppler-broadened absorption of a weak monochromatic probe beamin a thermal rubidium vapour cell on the D lines. A detailed model of thesusceptibility is developed which takes into account the absolute linestrengthsof the allowed electric dipole transitions and the motion of the atoms parallelto the probe beam. All transitions from both hyperfine levels of the groundterm of both isotopes are incorporated. The absorption and refractive index asa function of frequency are expressed in terms of the complementary errorfunction. The absolute absorption profiles are compared with experiment, andare found to be in excellent agreement provided a sufficiently weak probe beamwith an intensity under one thousandth of the saturation intensity is used. Theimportance of hyperfine pumping for open transitions is discussed in thecontext of achieving the weak-probe limit. Theory and experiment show excellentagreement, with an rms error better than 0.2% for the D2 line at 16.5 degreesC.

A Flexible Quasioptical Input System for a Submillimeter Muliobject  Spectrometer

  We present a conceptual design for the input optical system for amulti-object spectrometer operating at submillimeter wavelengths. The MirrorMOS is based on a sequence of mirrors that enables low-loss propagation ofbeams from selected positions distributed throughout the focal plane to thespectroscopic receiver inputs. This approach should be useful for observationsof sources which have a relatively low density on the sky, for which it isinefficient to use a traditional array receiver with uniformly spaced,relatively closely packed beams. Our concept is based on assigning a patrolregion to each of the receivers, which have inputs distributed over the focalplane of the telescope. The input to each receiver can be positioned at anypoint within this patrol region. This approach, with only 4 reflections, offersvery low loss. The Gaussian beam optical system can be designed to producefrequency-independent illumination of the telescope, which is an importantadvantage for broadband systems such those required for determination ofredshifts of submillimeter galaxies.

Recent Developments in Simulations of an Inverse Cyclotron for Intense  Muon Beams

  A number of recent developments have led to simulations of an inversecyclotron for cooling intense muon beams for neutrino factories and muoncolliders. Such a device could potentially act as a novel beam coolingmechanism for muons, and it would be significantly smaller and cheaper thanother cooling channel designs. Realistic designs are still being explored, butthe first simulations of particle tracking in the inverse cyclotron, withaccumulation in the cyclotron core, have been done with electrostaticsimulations in the particle-in-cell code VORPAL. We present an overview of themuon inverse cyclotron concept and recent simulation results.

Rotational Doppler beaming in eclipsing binaries

  In eclipsing binaries the stellar rotation of the two components will cause arotational Doppler beaming during eclipse ingress and egress when only part ofthe eclipsed component is covered. For eclipsing binaries with fast spinningcomponents this photometric analogue of the well-known spectroscopicRossiter-McLaughlin effect can exceed the strength of the orbital effect.Example light curves are shown for a detached double white dwarf binary, amassive O-star binary and a transiting exoplanet case, similar to WASP-33b.Inclusion of the rotational Doppler beaming in eclipsing systems is aprerequisite for deriving the correct stellar parameters from fitting highquality photometric light curves and can be used to determine stellarobliquities as well as e.g. an independent measure of the rotational velocityin those systems that may be expected to be fully synchronized.

Prospects for high-resolution microwave spectroscopy of methanol in a  Stark-deflected molecular beam

  Recently, the extremely sensitive torsion-rotation transitions in methanolhave been used to set a tight constraint on a possible variation of theproton-to-electron mass ratio over cosmological time scales. In order toimprove this constraint, laboratory data of increased accuracy will berequired. Here, we explore the possibility for performing high-resolutionspectroscopy on methanol in a Stark-deflected molecular beam. We havecalculated the Stark shift of the lower rotational levels in the groundtorsion-vibrational state of CH3OH and CD3OH molecules, and have used this tosimulate trajectories through a typical molecular beam resonance setup.Furthermore, we have determined the efficiency of non-resonant multi-photonionization of methanol molecules using a femtosecond laser pulse. The describedsetup is in principle suited to measure microwave transitions in CH3OH at anaccuracy below 10^{-8}.

In-situ growth optimization in focused electron-beam induced deposition

  We present the application of an evolutionary genetic algorithm for thein-situ optimization of nanostructures prepared by focusedelectron-beam-induced deposition. It allows us to tune the properties of thedeposits towards highest conductivity by using the time gradient of themeasured in-situ rate of change of conductance as fitness parameter for thealgorithm. The effectiveness of the procedure is presented for the precursorW(CO)6 as well as for post-treatment of Pt-C deposits obtained by dissociationof MeCpPt(Me)3. For W(CO)6-based structures an increase of conductivity by oneorder of magnitude can be achieved, whereas the effect for MeCpPt(Me)3 islargely suppressed. The presented technique can be applied to all beam-induceddeposition processes and has great potential for further optimization or tuningof parameters for nanostrucures prepared by FEBID or related techniques.

Superconductivity in the system $\rm Mo_xC_yGa_zO_δ$ prepared by  focused ion beam induced deposition

  We have prepared the new amorphous superconductor $\rm Mo_xC_yGa_zO_{\delta}$with a maximum critical temperature $T_c$ of 3.8\,K by the direct-writenano-patterning technique of focused (gallium) ion beam induced deposition(FIBID) using $\rm Mo(CO)_6$ as precursor gas. From a detailed analysis of thetemperature-dependent resistivity and the upper critical field we found clearevidence for proximity of the samples to a disorder-induced metal-insulatortransition. We observed a strong dependence of $T_c$ on the depositionparameters and identified clear correlations between $T_c$, the localizationtendency visible in the resistance data and the sample composition. By anin-situ feedback-controlled optimization process in the FIB-induced growth wewere able to identify the beam parameters which lead to samples with thelargest $T_c$-value and sharpest transition into the superconducting state.

Depletion region surface effects in electron beam induced current  measurements

  Electron beam induced current (EBIC) is a powerful characterization techniquewhich offers the high spatial resolution needed to study polycrystalline solarcells. Current models of EBIC assume that excitations in the $p$-$n$ junctiondepletion region result in perfect charge collection efficiency. However wefind that in CdTe and Si samples prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) milling,there is a reduced and nonuniform EBIC lineshape for excitations in thedepletion region. Motivated by this, we present a model of the EBIC responsefor excitations in the depletion region which includes the effects of surfacerecombination from both charge-neutral and charged surfaces. For neutralsurfaces we present a simple analytical formula which describes the numericaldata well, while the charged surface response depends qualitatively on thelocation of the surface Fermi level relative to the bulk Fermi level. We findthe experimental data on FIB-prepared Si solar cells is most consistent with acharged surface, and discuss the implications for EBIC experiments onpolycrystalline materials.

Single-laser, one beam, tetrahedral magneto-optical trap

  We have realised a 4-beam pyramidal magneto-optical trap ideally suited forfuture microfabrication. Three mirrors split and steer a single incoming beaminto a tripod of reflected beams, allowing trapping in the four-beam overlapvolume. We discuss the influence of mirror angle on cooling and trapping,finding optimum efficiency in a tetrahedral configuration. We demonstrate thetechnique using an ex-vacuo mirror system to illustrate the previouslyinaccessible supra-plane pyramid MOT configuration. Unlike standard pyramidalMOTs both the pyramid apex and its mirror angle are non-critical and our MOToffers improved molasses free from atomic shadows in the laser beams. The MOTscheme naturally extends to a 2-beam refractive version with high opticalaccess. For quantum gas experiments, the mirror system could also be used for astable 3D tetrahedral optical lattice.
