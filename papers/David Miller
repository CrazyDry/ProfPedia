  The purpose of this note is to discuss the real analogue of the Schwarz lemmafrom complex analysis.

Charmonium at CLEO-c

  Results are presented on Charmonium using data collected with the CLEO IIIand CLEO-c detectors at the Psi(2S) and Psi(3770). Measurements include, thefirst observation of the hc(1P1) state, the electronic widths of the J/Psi andPsi(2S), the two photon width of the Chic2 and hadronic decays of the Psi(2S).

Bayesian views of generalized additive modelling

  Links between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to smoothing werehighlighted early on in the smoothing literature, and power much of themachinery that underlies the modern generalized additive modelling framework(implemented in software such as the R package $\texttt{mgcv}$), but they tendto be unknown or under appreciated. This article aims to highlight useful linksbetween Bayesian and frequentist approaches to smoothing, and their practicalapplications (with a somewhat $\texttt{mgcv}$-centric viewpoint).

A constructive approach to the special theory of relativity

  Simple physical models of a measuring rod and of a clock are used todemonstrate the contraction of objects and clock retardation in specialrelativity. It is argued that the models could help in promoting studentunderstanding of special relativity and in distinguishing between dynamical andpurely perspectival effects.

Irrationality From The Book

  We generalize Tennenbaum's geometric proof of the irrationality of sqrt(2) tosqrt(n) for n = 3, 5, 6 and 10. Modified version published in MathematicsMagazine \textbf{85} (2012), no. 2, 110--114.

Alternative Experimental Protocol for a PBR-Like Result

  Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph (PBR) have recently proven an important newtheorem in the foundations of quantum mechanics. Here we propose alternativeexperimental protocols which lead to the PBR result for a special case and aweaker PBR-like result generally. Alternative experimental protocols supportthe assumption of measurement independence required for the PBR theorem.

Concordances from the standard surface in $S^2\times S^2$

  In this note, we combine the recent 4-dimensional light bulb theorem of DavidGabai and a recent construction of concordances for knots in $S^2\times S^1$due to Eylem Zeliha Yildiz to construct a concordance between the standardsurface of genus $g$ in $S^2\times S^2$ and any homologous surface.

Search for Rare and Forbidden Decays of D mesons to Final States with  Electrons

  Using the CLEO-c detector and a data sample of 0.8 million D+D- pairs at thePsi(3770) a search has been performed for flavor changing neutral current andlepton number violating decays of D+ mesons to final states with dielectrons.No signals are observed and 90% confidence limits are set for specific decaymodes in the range of a few times ten to the minus six.

Gluon condensates at finite temperature

  We consider various special cases of gluon condensates at finite temperature.The gluon condensate for an ideal gas of gluons with a given vacuum expectationvalue is introduced for the sake of comparison with that calculated using therecent finite temperature lattice gauge simulations for a pure Yang-Mills SU(3)gauge theory at the known critical temperature. We extend this comparison usingthe high precision lattice data for two light dynamical quarks. Theinvestigation of these three cases show some interesting differences arisingfrom the strong interaction alone and in the presence of quarks. In thiscontext we discuss some newer simulations for heavier quarks and otherproperties related to gluon condensation.

Entropy for $SU(3)_c$ Quark States

  We discuss the quantum state structure using the standard model for threecolored quarks in the fundamental representations of $SU(3)_c$ making up thesinglet ground state of the hadrons. This allows us to calculate a finite vonNeumann entropy from the quantum reduced density matrix, which we explicitlyevaluate for the quarks in a model for the meson and baryon states. Finally welook into the general effects and implications of entanglement in the $SU(3)_c$color space.

Entropy for Diquarks in exotic Quark States

  We discuss the quantum state structure on the basis of $SU(3)_c$ for someknown exotic quark systems using a model which describes these particularstates as highly correlated diquarks and antidiquarks. We are then able tocalculate for a single colored diquark a finite von Neumann entropy from thequantum reduced density matrix, from which we explicitly evaluate thelikelihood of certain arrangements of quark flavors in a given diquark. Theseresults can be related to some recently experimentally found pentaquark systemsas well as a possible model for the scalar mesons.

Lattice QCD Calculation for the Physical Equation of State

  In this report we consider the numerical simulations at finite temperatureusing lattice QCD data for the computation of the thermodynamical quantitiesincluding the pressure, energy density and the entropy density. These physicalquantities can be related to the equation of state for quarks and gluons. Weshall apply the lattice data to the evaluation of the specific structure of thegluon and quark condensates at finite temperature in relation to thedeconfinement and chiral phase transitions. Finally we mention the quantumnature of the phases at lower temperatures.

Embedding Cohen algebras using pcf theory

  Using a theorem from pcf theory, we show that for any singular cardinal nu,the product of the Cohen forcing notions on kappa, kappa < nu adds a genericfor the Cohen forcing notion on nu^+. This solves Problem 5.1 in Miller's list(attributed to Rene David and Sy Friedman).

Subspaces of Knot Spaces

  The inclusion of the space of all knots of a prescribed writhe in aparticular isotopy class into the space of all knots in that isotopy class is aweak homotopy equivalence.

How complicated must an optical component be?

  We analyze how complicated a linear optical component has to be if it is toperform one of a range of functions. Specifically, we devise an approach toevaluating the number of real parameters that must be specified in the devicedesign or fabrication, based on the singular value decomposition of the linearoperator that describes the device. This approach can be used for essentiallyany linear device, including space-, frequency-, or time-dependent systems, inoptics or in other linear wave problems. We analyze examples including spatialmode converters and various classes of wavelength demultiplexers. We considerlimits on the functions that can be performed by simple optical devices such asthin lenses, mirrors, gratings, modulators, and fixed optical filters, anddiscuss the potential for greater functionalities using modern nanophotonics.

Self-aligning universal beam coupler

  We propose a device that can take an arbitrary monochromatic input beam andcouple it into a single-mode guide or beam. Simple feedback loops fromdetectors to modulator elements allow the device to adapt automatically to anyspecific input beam form. Potential applications include automatic compensationfor misalignment and defocusing of an input beam, coupling of complex modes ormultiple beams from fibers or free space to single-mode guides, and retainingcoupling to a moving source. Straightforward extensions allow multipledifferent overlapping orthogonal input beams to be separated simultaneously todifferent single-mode guides with no splitting loss in principle. The approachis suitable for implementation in integrated optics platforms that offerelements such as phase shifters, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, gratingcouplers, and integrated monitoring detectors, and the basic approach isapplicable in principle to other types of waves, such as microwaves oracoustics.

On the number of maximal independent sets in a graph

  Miller and Muller (1960) and independently Moon and Moser (1965) determinedthe maximum number of maximal independent sets in an $n$-vertex graph. We givea new and simple proof of this result.

Fundamental Limit to Linear One-Dimensional Slow Light Structures

  Using a new general approach to limits in optical structures that countsorthogonal waves generated by scattering, we derive an upper limit to thenumber of bits of delay possible in one-dimensional slow light structures thatare based on linear optical response to the signal field. The limit isessentially the product of the length of the structure in wavelengths and thelargest relative change in dielectric constant anywhere in the structure at anyfrequency of interest. It holds for refractive index, absorption or gainvariations with arbitrary spectral or spatial form. It is otherwise completelyindependent of the details of the structure's design, and does not rely onconcepts of group velocity or group delay.

Self-Configuring Universal Linear Optical Component

  We show how to design an optical device that can perform any linear functionor coupling between inputs and outputs. This design method is progressive,requiring no global optimization. We also show how the device can configureitself progressively, avoiding design calculations and allowing the device tostabilize itself against drifts in component properties and to continuallyadjust itself to changing conditions. This self-configuration operates bytraining with the desired pairs of orthogonal input and output functions, usingsets of detectors and local feedback loops to set individual optical elementswithin the device, with no global feedback or multiparameter optimizationrequired. Simple mappings, such as spatial mode conversions and polarizationcontrol, can be implemented using standard planar integrated optics. In thespirit of a universal machine, we show that other linear operations, includingfrequency and time mappings, as well as non-reciprocal operation, are possiblein principle, even if very challenging in practice, thus proving there is atleast one constructive design for any conceivable linear optical component;such a universal device can also be self-configuring. This approach is generalfor linear waves, and could be applied to microwaves, acoustics and quantummechanical superpositions.

Structural relaxation in Morse clusters: Energy landscapes

  We perform a comprehensive survey of the potential energy landscapes of13-atom Morse clusters, and describe how they can be characterized andvisualized. Our aim is to detail how the global features of the funnel-likesurface change with the range of the potential, and to relate these changes tothe dynamics of structural relaxation. We find that the landscape becomesrougher and less steep as the range of the potential decreases, and thatrelaxation paths to the global minimum become more complicated.

Energy Landscape of a Model Protein

  The potential energy surface of an off-lattice model protein is characterizedin detail by constructing a disconnectivity graph and by examining theorganisation of pathways on the surface. The results clearly reveal thefrustration exhibited by this system and explain why it does not foldefficiently to the global potential energy minimum. In contrast, when thefrustration is removed by constructing a `Go-type' model, the resulting graphexhibits the characteristics expected for a folding funnel.

Novel Structural Motifs in Clusters of Dipolar Spheres: Knots, Links and  Coils

  We present the structures of putative global potential energy minima forclusters bound by the Stockmayer (Lennard-Jones plus point dipole) potential. Arich variety of structures is revealed as the cluster size and dipole strengthare varied. Most remarkable are groups of closed-loop structures with thetopology of knots and links. Despite the large number of possibilities,energetically optimal structures exhibit only a few such topologies.

The Jet Multiplicity as a Function of Thrust

  We calculate the average multiplicity of jets in e+e- annihilation as afunction of both the jet resolution parameter, y_cut, and the thrust T. Ourresult resums to all orders the leading and next-to-leading logarithms in y_cutand 1-T, and is exact up to second order in alpha_s. This allows a comparisonbetween the number of jets found using jet algorithms and the ability todistinguish different jet topologies via thrust.

Secondary Heavy Quark Pair Production in e+e- Annihilation

  The multiplicity of heavy quarks from gluon splitting in e+e- annihilationhas now been theoretically calculated and experimentally measured at LEP.However, the experimental measurement requires theoretical input for the shapeof the multiplicity with respect to an event shape. In this paper we calculatethe multiplicity of heavy quarks from gluon splitting in e+e- annihilation as afunction of the heavy jet mass of the event, to next-to-leading logarithmicaccuracy. We compare our result with Monte Carlo predictions.

The Multiplicity of Heavy Quark Pairs from Gluon Splitting in e+e-  Annihilation

  I will briefly review the progress which has been made in the investigationof secondary heavy quark production at LEP. I will show why a calculation ofthe secondary heavy quark multiplicity, keeping the dependence on an eventshape variable, is essential for better exploitation of data, and I willpresent the results of such a calculation. This will be compared to Monte Carlostudies.

Linear Collider Physics

  Studies of the physics potential of the Future Linear Collider areestablishing a broad programme which will start in the region of 350 to 500 GeVC. of M. energy. The main goal is to understand why the standard model works;by studying the properties of the Higgs sector, if it is within reach, and byexploring the complex world of Supersymmetry, if it is real. If the Higgs bosonis not found soon, then the Linear Collider can test the standard model withhigh precision measurements, both at energies approaching 1 TeV and with highstatistics at the Z0.

Algorithms for graded injective resolutions and local cohomology over  semigroup rings

  Let Q be an affine semigroup generating Z^d, and fix a finitely generatedZ^d-graded module M over the semigroup algebra k[Q] for a field k. We providean algorithm to compute a minimal Z^d-graded injective resolution of M up toany desired cohomological degree. As an application, we derive an algorithmcomputing the local cohomology modules H^i_I(M) supported on any monomial (thatis, Z^d-graded) ideal I. Since these local cohomology modules are neitherfinitely generated nor finitely cogenerated, part of this task is defining afinite data structure to encode them.

Counterfactual reasoning in time-symmetric quantum mechanics

  A qualification is suggested for the counterfactual reasoning involved insome aspects of time-symmetric quantum theory (which involves ensemblesselected by both the initial and final states). The qualification is that thecounterfactual reasoning should only apply to times when the quantum system hasbeen subjected to physical interactions which place it in a ``measurement-readycondition" for the unperformed experiment on which the counterfactual reasoningis based. The defining characteristic of a "measurement-ready condition" isthat a quantum system could be found to have the counterfactually ascribedproperty without direct physical interaction with the eigenstate correspondingto that property.

Pre- and post-selected ensembles and time-symmetry in quantum mechanics

  An expression is proposed for the quantum mechanical state of a pre- andpost-selected ensemble, which is an ensemble determined by the final as well asthe initial state of the quantum systems involved. It is shown that theprobabilities calculated from the proposed state agree with previousexpressions, for cases where they both apply. The same probabilities are foundwhen they are calculated in the forward- or reverse-time directions. This workwas prompted by several problems raised by Shimony recently in relation to thestate, and time symmetry, of pre- and post-selected ensembles.

CP Asymmetries in Higgs decays to ZZ at the LHC

  We examine the effect of a general HZZ coupling through a study of the Higgsdecay to leptons via Z bosons at the LHC. We discuss various methods forplacing limits on additional couplings, including measurement of the partialwidth, threshold scans, and asymmetries constructed from angular observables.We find that only the asymmetries provide a definitive test of additionalcouplings. We further estimate the significances they provide.

Structural trends in clusters of quadrupolar spheres

  The influence of quadrupolar interactions on the structure of small clustersis investigated by adding a point quadrupole of variable strength to theLennard-Jones potential. Competition arises between sheet-like arrangements ofthe particles, favoured by the quadrupoles, and compact structures, favoured bythe isotropic Lennard-Jones attraction. Putative global potential energy minimaare obtained for clusters of up to 25 particles using the basin-hoppingalgorithm. A number of structural motifs and growth sequences emerge, includingstar-like structures, tubes, shells and sheets. The results are discussed inthe context of colloidal self-assembly.

State-dependent rotations of spins by weak measurements

  IIt is shown that a weak measurement of a quantum system produces a new stateof the quantum system which depends on the prior state, as well as the(uncontrollable) measured position of the pointer variable of the weakmeasurement apparatus. The result imposes a constraint on hidden-variabletheories which assign a different state to a quantum system than standardquantum mechanics. The constraint means that a crypto-nonlocal hidden-variabletheory can be ruled out in a more direct way than previously.

Definable maximal discrete sets in forcing extensions

  Let $\mathcal R$ be a $\Sigma^1_1$ binary relation, and recall that a set $A$is $\mathcal R$-discrete if no two elements of $A$ are related by $\mathcal R$.We show that in the Sacks and Miller forcing extensions of $L$ there is a$\Delta^1_2$ maximal $\mathcal{R}$-discrete set. We use this to answer in thenegative the main question posed in [5] by showing that in the Sacks and Millerextensions there is a $\Pi^1_1$ maximal orthogonal family ("mof") of Borelprobability measures on Cantor space. A similar result is also obtained for$\Pi^1_1$ mad families. By contrast, we show that if there is a Mathias realover $L$ then there are no $\Sigma^1_2$ mofs.

Control and tuning of a suspended Fabry-Perot cavity using  digitally-enhanced heterodyne interferometry

  We present the first demonstration of real-time closed-loop control anddeterministic tuning of an independently suspended Fabry-Perot optical cavityusing digitally-enhanced heterodyne interferometry, realising a peaksensitivity of $\sim$10 pm$/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ over the 10-1000 Hz frequencyband. The methods presented are readily extensible to multiple coupledcavities. As such, we anticipate that refinements of this technique may findapplication in future interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.

High scale boundary conditions with an additional complex singlet

  We investigate Planck scale boundary conditions on Higgs quartic interactionsand their $\beta$-functions in the SM augmented by an additional complexscalar. We use renormalisation group running at two-loops, and include boththeoretical and experimental constraints. We find that the boundary condition$\lambda=\beta_\lambda=0$ at the Planck scale is compatible with the currentHiggs and top mass measurements, but requires additional scalars lighter thanabout $600\,$GeV.

TopFitter: Fitting top-quark Wilson Coefficients to Run II data

  We describe the latest TopFitter analysis, which uses top quark observablesto fit the Wilson Coefficients of the SM augmented with dimension-6 operators.In particular, we discuss the inclusion of new LHC Run II data and theimplementation of particle-level observables.

Confronting Scherk-Schwarz orbifold models with LHC data

  We will outline our recent efforts aimed at analysing a class of models knownas orbifold GUTs and their phenomenology in a variety of minimal andnon-minimal settings. We examine the minimal SU(5) models, rule them out, andproceed by extending them with an additional scalar field along with a gaugeextension via SU(5)xU(1) models. We end up by commenting on the futureimprovements needed to more accurately handle exclusions along with tracing theU(1) gauge extensions to more complete 6D theories.

Scherk-Schwarz orbifolds at the LHC

  We examine orbifold theories of Grand Unification with Scherk-Schwarztwisting, performing a renormalisation group analysis and applying low energyexperimental constraints. We rule out the minimal SU(5) models, and considersimple extensions including additional fields, such as an additional scalarfield, or additional symmetries, such as $SU(5)\times U(1)$ or $E_6$. We findthat it is very difficult to generate a large enough Higgs mass whilesimultaneously passing LHC experimental search constraints.

Local superfluid densities probed via current-induced superconducting  phase gradients

  We have developed a superconducting phase gradiometer consisting of twoparallel DNA-templated nanowires connecting two thin-film leads. We have rampedthe cross current flowing perpendicular to the nanowires, and observedoscillations in the lead-to-lead resistance due to cross-current-induced phasedifferences. By using this gradiometer we have measured the temperature andmagnetic field dependence of the superfluid density and observed anamplification of phase gradients caused by elastic vortex displacements. Weexamine our data in light of Miller-Bardeen theory of dirty superconductors anda microscale version of Campbell's model of field penetration.

First Measurement of the Inclusive Branching Ratio of b Hadrons to phi  Mesons in Z0 Decays

  The inclusive production rate of phi mesons from the decay of b hadronsproduced in Z0 decays was measured to be Br(b->phi+X) =0.0282+-0.0013(stat.)+-0.0019(syst.), using data collected by the OPAL detectorat LEP.

Spectral Density on the Lattice

  Spectral density in the pseudoscalar and vector channels is extracted fromthe SU(2) lattice quenched data. It is shown to consist of three sharp poleswithin the energy range accessible on the lattice.

Measuring the period of the delta Scuti variable U1425-01208594 in  Cassiopeia

  The variability of U1425-01208594 was recently discovered by Schmidtobreicket al, who suggested that it is a member of the delta Scuti family of pulsatingstars. Photometry conducted by the authors revealed a period of 0.06695(8) dand a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.014 mag.

The 2008 February superoutburst of V452 Cas

  Observations of the 2008 February outburst of V452 Cas show that the profile,duration and magnitude at maximum were very similar to the previoussuperoutburst in 2007 September. Low-amplitude variations consistent withpreviously observed superhumps were also seen.

A Breakthrough in Sphere Packing: The Search for Magic Functions

  This paper is an exposition, written for the Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde,about the two recent breakthrough results in the theory of sphere packings. Itincludes an interview with Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D. Miller, andMaryna Viazovska.

Adversarial Learning: A Critical Review and Active Learning Study

  This papers consists of two parts. The first is a critical review of priorart on adversarial learning, identifying some significant limitations ofprevious works. The second part is an experimental study consideringadversarial active learning and an investigation of the efficacy of a mixedsample selection strategy for combating an adversary who attempts to disruptthe classifier learning.

The Gluon Condensate in QCD at Finite Temperature

  We begin with the discussion of the relationship between the trace of theenergy momentum tensor and the gluon condensate at finite temperatures. Usingthe recent numerical data from the simulations of lattice gauge theory forquantum chromodynamics(QCD) we present the computational evaluations for thegluon condensate. A short discussion of the properties of deconfinement and theimplications on the high temperature limit are included. We also mention thecase of the massive quarks where some of the properties of the condensateappear to change. We put together these results with some ideas related to thedilatation current. We draw the conclusion that the nature of the stronginteractions implies that the thermodynamics of quarks and gluons neverapproach even at very high temperatures that of an ideal ultrarelativistic gas.

Anomalous Currents and Gluon Condensates in QCD at Finite Temperature

  After a short description of the currents coming from the known conservationlaws in classical physics, we look at some further cases which arise afterquantization in relation to quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature.In these cases, however, some basic changes appear with the anomalies. First wego into the relationship between the trace of the energy momentum tensor andthe gluon condensate at finite temperature. Using the recent numerical datafrom the simulations of lattice guage theory we present the computationalevaluations for the gluon condensates at finite temperature. Thereafter wediscuss the effects of chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finitetemperature through the chiral phase transition. In this context we investigatethe properties of the gluon condensate in the presence of massive dynamicalquarks using numerical data. Finally we put together these results with adiscussion of the various anomalous currents and their relationship to ourfindings here.

Linear Collider Physics

  The International Linear Collider has a rich physics programme, whatever liesbeyond the standard model. Accurate measurement of the top quark mass is neededto constrain the model or its extensions. If there is a light Higgs boson theLHC should see it, but the ILC will pin down its characteristics and test themagainst model predictions. If Supersymmetric particles appear the ILC willmeasure a complementary set of them to those seen at the LHC, and may allowextrapolation to the Grand Unified scale. And if a strong electroweak sector isindicated the ILC will be sensitive to the presence of new structures indifermion and diboson systems up to higher masses than the direct search rangeof the LHC. Beyond the LHC and ILC there could be need for a multi TeV leptoncollider.

Popaths and Holinks

  In the study of stratified spaces it is useful to examine spaces of popaths(paths which travel from lower strata to higher strata) and holinks (thosespaces of popaths which immediately leave a lower stratum for their finalstratum destination). It is not immediately clear that for adjacent stratathese two path spaces are homotopically equivalent, and even less clear thatthis equivalence can be constructed in a useful way (with a deformation of thespace of popaths which fixes start and end points and where popaths instantlybecome members of the holink). The advantage of such an equivalence is that itallows a stratified space to be viewed categorically because popaths, unlikeholink paths (which are easier to study), can be composed. This paper provesthe aforementioned equivalence in the case of Quinn's homotopically stratifiedspaces.

Jet substructure in ATLAS

  Measurements are presented of the jet invariant mass and substructure inproton-proton collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector using anintegrated luminosity of 37 pb-1. These results exercise the tools fordistinguishing the signatures of new boosted massive particles in the hadronicfinal state. Two "fat" jet algorithms are used, along with the filtering jetgrooming technique that was pioneered in ATLAS. New jet substructureobservables are compared for the first time to data at the LHC. Finally, asample of candidate boosted top quark events collected in the 2010 data isanalyzed in detail for the jet substructure properties of hadronic "top-jets"in the final state. These measurements demonstrate not only our excellentunderstanding of QCD in a new energy regime but open the path to using complexjet substructure observables in the search for new physics.
