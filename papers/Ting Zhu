Reducible and irreducible approximation of complex symmetric operators

  This paper aims to study reducible and irreducible approximation in the set$\textsl{CSO}$ of all complex symmetric operators on a separable, complexHilbert space $\mathcal H$. When ${\rm dim} \mathcal H=\infty$, it is provedthat both those reducible ones and those irreducible ones are norm dense in$\textsl{CSO}$. When ${\rm dim} \mathcal H<\infty$, irreducible complexsymmetric operators constitute an open, dense subset of $\textsl{CSO}$.

High-dimensional Wilks phenomena in the Bradley-Terry model

  In this paper, we show the Wilks type of results for the Bradley-Terry model.Specifically, for some simple and composite null hypotheses of interest, weshow that the likelihood ratio test statistic $\Lambda$ enjoys a chi-squareapproximation in the sense that $(2p)^{-1/2}(-2\log \Lambda-p)\stackrel{L}{\rightarrow}N(0,1)$ as $p$ goes to infinity, where $p$ is thecorresponding degrees of freedom. Simulation studies and an application to NBAdata illustrate the theoretical results.

Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for mixed d- and s-wave  superconductors

  A set of coupled time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations (TDGL) forsuperconductors of mixed d- and s-wave symmetry are derived microscopicallyfrom the Gor'kov equations by using the analytical continuation technique. Thescattering effects due to impurities with both nonmagnetic and magneticinteractions are considered. We find that the d- and s-wave components of theorder parameter can have very different relaxation times in the presence ofnonmagnetic impurities. This result is contrary to a set of phenomenologicallyproposed TDGL equations and thus may lead to new physics in the dynamics offlux motion.

Superconductivity in Ferromagnetic RuSr_2GdCu_2O_8

  The phase diagram of temperature versus exchange field is obtained within aBCS model for d-wave superconductivity in CuO_2 layers which is coupled toferromagnetic RuO_2 layers in RuSr_2GdCu_2O_8. It is found that theFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is very sensitive to the band fillingfactor. For strong exchange field, we point out that superconductivity couldonly exist in the interfaces between ferromagnetic domains. The magnetizationcurve is calculated and its comparison with experiment is discussed. We alsopropose the measuring of tunneling conductance near a single unitary impurityto detect the strength of the exchange interaction.

Kondo Resonance in the Presence of Spin-Polarized Currents

  We propose an improved method of the equation of motion approach to study theKondo problem in spin-dependent non-equilibrium conditions. We find that thepreviously introduced additional renormalization for non-equilibrium Kondoeffects is not required when we use a proper decoupling scheme. Our improvedformulation is then applied to address the spin-split Kondo peaks when a spincurrent injects into a Kondo system.

Retrieval-Enhanced Adversarial Training for Neural Response Generation

  Dialogue systems are usually built on either generation-based orretrieval-based approaches, yet they do not benefit from the advantages ofdifferent models. In this paper, we propose a Retrieval-Enhanced AdversarialTraining (REAT) method for neural response generation. Distinct from existingap- proaches, the REAT method leverages an encoder-decoder framework in termsof an adversarial training paradigm, while taking advantage of N-best responsecandidates from a retrieval-based system to construct the discriminator. Anempirical study on a large scale public available benchmark dataset shows thatthe REAT method significantly outper- forms the vanilla Seq2Seq model as wellas the conventional adversarial training approach.

Asymptotics in directed exponential random graph models with an  increasing bi-degree sequence

  Although asymptotic analyses of undirected network models based on degreesequences have started to appear in recent literature, it remains an openproblem to study statistical properties of directed network models. In thispaper, we provide for the first time a rigorous analysis of directedexponential random graph models using the in-degrees and out-degrees assufficient statistics with binary as well as continuous weighted edges. Weestablish the uniform consistency and the asymptotic normality for the maximumlikelihood estimate, when the number of parameters grows and only one realizedobservation of the graph is available. One key technique in the proofs is toapproximate the inverse of the Fisher information matrix using a simple matrixwith high accuracy. Numerical studies confirm our theoretical findings.

On unbiased performance evaluation for protein inference

  This letter is a response to the comments of Serang (2012) on Huang and He(2012) in Bioinformatics. Serang (2012) claimed that the parameters for theFido algorithm should be specified using the grid search method in Serang etal. (2010) so as to generate a deserved accuracy in performance comparison. Itseems that it is an argument on parameter tuning. However, it is indeed theissue of how to conduct an unbiased performance evaluation for comparingdifferent protein inference algorithms. In this letter, we would explain why wedon't use the grid search for parameter selection in Huang and He (2012) andshow that this procedure may result in an over-estimated performance that isunfair to competing algorithms. In fact, this issue has also been pointed outby Li and Radivojac (2012).

Phase and dispersion engineering of metalenses: broadband achromatic  focusing and imaging in the visible

  Metasurfaces have the potential to miniaturize and improve the performance ofany optical element, with applications spanning telecommunications, computingand wearable optics. However, the ability to retain functionality over acontinuous, broad range of wavelengths is essential for their widespreadadoption. So far, efforts to achieve this have been limited to either areflection configuration or operation at wavelengths other than the visible.Here, we show that by judicious choice of nanostructures, one can independentlycontrol both the phase and group delay, leading to broadband transmissiveachromatic metalenses and metalenses with tunable dispersion across the visiblespectrum. We demonstrate diffraction-limited broadband focusing and achromaticimaging using metalenses across wavelengths from 470 nm to 670 nm, with focallength change of a few percent across this 200 nm bandwidth. This approachrequires only a single layer metasurface whose thickness is on the wavelengthscale, and does not involve spatial multiplexing or cascading.

A broadband achromatic polarization-insensitive metalens consisting of  anisotropic nanostructures

  Metasurfaces have attracted widespread attention due to an increasing demandof compact and wearable optical devices. For many applications,polarization-insensitive metasurfaces are highly desirable and appear to limitthe choice of their constituent elements to isotropic nanostructures. Thisgreatly restricts the degrees of geometric parameters available in designingeach nanostructure. Here, we demonstrate a polarization-insensitive metalensusing otherwise anisotropic nanofins which offer additional control over thedispersion and phase of the output light. As a result, we can render a metalensachromatic and polarization-insensitive across nearly the entire visiblespectrum from wavelength 460 nm to 700 nm, while maintainingdiffraction-limited performance. The metalens is comprised of just a singlelayer of TiO2 nanofins and has a numerical aperture of 0.2 with a diameter of26.4 um. The generality of our polarization-insensitive design allows it to beimplemented in a plethora of other metasurface devices with applicationsranging from imaging to virtual/augmented reality.

Local Quasiparticle States near a Unitary Impurity with Induced Magnetic  Moment in a d-Wave Superconductor

  The local quasiparticle density of states around a unitary impurity with aKondo-like magnetic moment induced at its nearest neighbors in a d-wavesuperconductor is studied within the slave-boson mean-field approach. TheHamiltonian is exactly diagonalized and the results are obtainedself-consistently. We show that the interference between the strong impuritypotential scattering and the Kondo effect leads to novel quasiparticle spectraaround the impurity, which are strikingly different from the case of a singleunitary or magnetic impurity. The recent STM image of the local differentialtunneling conductance around a Zn impurity in a high-T_c cuprate can beessentially explained if the blocking effect of BiO surface layer between thetip and probed CuO_2 plane [Zhu et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 6207 (2000)] is takeninto account.

Competing effects of mass anisotropy and spin Zeeman coupling on the  upper critical field of a mixed $d$- and s-wave superconductor

  Based on the linearized Eilenberger equations, the upper critical field$(H_{c2})$ of mixed d- and s-wave superconductors has been microscopicallystudied with an emphasis on the competing effects of mass anisotropy and spinZeeman coupling. We find the mass anisotropy always enhance $H_{c2}$ while theZeeman interaction suppresses $H_{c2}$. As required by the thermodynamics, wefind $H_{c2}$ is saturated at zero temperature. We compare the theoreticalcalculations with recent experimental data ofYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-+AFw-delta}$.

C-axis Response of a High-T_{c} Superconductor with D-Density Wave Order

  The microscopic origin of the pseudogap state which exists in the underdopedcuprates remains unknown. The $c$-axis properties in the pseudogap regime areparticularly anomalous. We use a recently proposed model of a $d$-density wavewhich leads to staggered currents and the doubling of the unit cell toinvestigate the $c$-axis kinetic energy and the optical sum rule. The densityof states expected in the model is also considered.

Quantum interference in dirty d-wave superconductors

  The local differential tunneling conductance on a Zn impurity in a disorderedd-wave superconductors is studied. Quantum interference between many impuritiesleads to definitive quasiparticle spectra. We suggest that an elaborateanalysis on impurity-induced spectra with quantum interference effect includedmay be able to pin down the sign and strength of the scattering potential of aZn impurity in low density limit. Numerical simulations calculated withappropriately determined impurity parameters are in satisfactory agreement withthe observations from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments even insubtle details.

Neural Personalized Response Generation as Domain Adaptation

  In this paper, we focus on the personalized response generation forconversational systems. Based on the sequence to sequence learning, especiallythe encoder-decoder framework, we propose a two-phase approach, namelyinitialization then adaptation, to model the responding style of human and thengenerate personalized responses. For evaluation, we propose a novel human aidedmethod to evaluate the performance of the personalized response generationmodels by online real-time conversation and offline human judgement. Moreover,the lexical divergence of the responses generated by the 5 personalized modelsindicates that the proposed two-phase approach achieves good results onmodeling the responding style of human and generating personalized responsesfor the conversational systems.

Evolutionary Multitasking for Single-objective Continuous Optimization:  Benchmark Problems, Performance Metric, and Baseline Results

  In this report, we suggest nine test problems for multi-task single-objectiveoptimization (MTSOO), each of which consists of two single-objectiveoptimization tasks that need to be solved simultaneously. The relationshipbetween tasks varies between different test problems, which would be helpful tohave a comprehensive evaluation of the MFO algorithms. It is expected that theproposed test problems will germinate progress the field of the MTSOO research.

Spontaneous flux in a d-wave superconductor with  time-reversal-symmetry-broken pairing state at {110} boundaries

  The induction of an s-wave component in a d-wave superconductor isconsidered. Near the {110}-oriented edges of such a sample, the induced s-waveorder parameter together with d-wave component forms a complex combinationd+e^{i\phi} s, which breaks the time reversal symmetry (BTRS) of the pairingstate. As a result, the spontaneous current is created. We numerically studythe current distribution and the formation of the spontaneous flux induced bythe current. We show that the spontaneous flux formed from a number of defectlines with {110} orientation has a measurable strength. This result may providea unambiguous way to check the existence of BTRS pairing state at{110}-oriented boundaries.

Quasiparticle Resonant States Induced by a Unitary Impurity in a d-Wave  Superconductor

  The quasiparticle resonant states around a single nonmagnetic impurity withunitary scattering in a d-wave superconductor is studied by solving theBogoliubov-de Gennes equations based on a t-J model. Both the spatial variationof the order parameter and the local density of states (LDOS) around theimpurity have been investigated. We find: (i) A particle-hole symmetric systemhas a single symmetric zero-energy peak in the LDOS regardless of the size ofthe superconducting coherence length \xi_0; (ii) For the particle-holeasymmetric case, an asymmetric splitting of the zero-energy peak is intrinsicto a system with a small value of k_{F}\xi_0.

Proximity effect, quasiparticle transport, and local magnetic moment in  ferromagnet-d-wave superconductor junctions

  The proximity effect, quasiparticle transport, and local magnetic moment inferromagnet--d-wave superconductor junctions with {110}-oriented interface arestudied by solving self-consistently the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations withinan extended Hubbard model. It is found that the proximity induced orderparameter oscillates in the ferromagnetic region. The modulation period isshortened with the increased exchange field while the oscillation amplitude isdepressed by the interfacial scattering. With the determined superconductingenergy gap, a transfer matrix method is proposed to compute the subgapconductance within a scattering approach. Many novel features including thezero-bias conductance dip and splitting are exhibited with appropriate valuesof the exchange field and interfacial scattering strength. The conductancespectrum can be influenced seriously by the spin-flip interfacial scattering.In addition, a sizable local magnetic moment near the {110}-oriented surface ofthe d-wave superconductor is discussed.

Quasiparticle Localization in Disordered d-Wave Superconductors

  An extensive numerical study is reported on disorder effect intwo-dimensional d-wave superconductors with random impurities in the unitarylimit. It is found that a sharp resonant peak shows up in the density of statesat zero energy and correspondingly the finite-size spin conductance is stronglyenhanced which results in a non-universal feature in one-parameter scaling.However, all quasiparticle states remain localized, indicating that theresonant density peak alone is not sufficient to induce delocalization. In theweak disorder limit, the localization length is so long that the spinconductance at small sample size is close to the universal value predicted byLee (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 71}, 1887 (1993)).

Local Quasiparticle States around an Anderson Impurity in a d-Wave  Superconductor: Kondo Effects

  The Kondo effects of an Anderson impurity embedded into a d-wavesuperconductor is studied. Within the slave-boson mean-field approach, thederived Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are solved via exact diagonalization. Weshow that a critical coupling strength, above which the Kondo effect takesplace, exists regardless of whether the band particle-hole symmetry is presentor not. The resonant quasiparticle peaks are found in the local density ofstates (LDOS) both directly at the impurity and around its neighbors, which isin sharp contrast to the case of nonmagnetic unitary impurities, where the LDOSvanishes on the impurity site.

Quasiparticle States at a d-Wave Vortex Core in High-Tc Superconductors:  Induction of Local Spin Density Wave Order

  The local density of states (LDOS) at one of the vortex lattice cores in ahigh Tc superconductor is studied by using a self-consistent mean field theoryincluding interactions for both antiferromagnetism (AF) and d-wavesuperconductivity (DSC). The parameters are chosen in such a way that in anoptimally doped sample the AF order is completely suppressed while DSCprevails. In the mixed state, we show that the local AF-like SDW order appearsnear the vortex core and acts as an effective local magnetic field on thequasiparticles. As a result, the LDOS at the core exhibits a double-peakstructure near the Fermi level that is in good agreement with the STMobservations on YBCO and BSCCO. The presence of local AF order near the votexcore is also consistent with the recent neutron scattering experiment on LSCO.

Quasiparticle States around a Nonmagnetic Impurity in D-Density-Wave  State of High-$T_c$ Cuprates

  Recently Chakravarty {\em et al.} proposed an ordered $d$-density wave (DDW)state as an explanation of the pseudogap phase in underdoped high-temperaturecuprates. We study the competition between the DDW and superconducting orderingbased on an effective mean-field Hamiltonian. We are mainly concerned with theeffect of the DDW ordering on the electronic state around a single nonmagneticimpurity. We find that a single subgap resonance peak appears in the localdensity of state around the impurity. In the unitary limit, the position ofthis resonance peak is always located at $E_r=-\mu$ with respect to the Fermienergy. This result is dramatically different from the case of the puresuperconducting state for which the impurity resonant energy is approximatelypinned at the Fermi level. This can be used to probe the existence of the DDWordering in cuprates.

High Angular Momentum Core States and Impurity Effects in the Mixed  State of d-Wave Superconductors

  The local quasiparticle spectra around the vortex core of a d-wavesuperconductor in the mixed state is studied by solving the latticeBogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently. It is shown that in additionto the zero-energy states, there also exist core states of high angularmomentum. A nonmagnetic unitary impurity sitting at the core center isnondestructive to these core states and the zero-energy resonant state inducedby itself is still visible in the local quasiparticle spectrum. The calculatedimaging shows a fourfold ``star'' shape of the local density of states whoseorientation is energy dependent. It is also found that, although thezero-energy states are extended, the core states of finite energy level couldbe localized.

Validity of Equation-of-Motion Approach to Kondo Problem in the  Large-$N$ limit

  The Anderson impurity model for Kondo problem is investigated for arbitraryorbit-spin degeneracy $N$ of the magnetic impurity by the equation of motionmethod (EOM). By employing a new decoupling scheme, a set self-consistentequations for the one-particle Green function are derived and numericallysolved in the large-$N$ approximation. For the particle-hole symmetric Andersonmodel with finite Coulomb interaction $U$, we show that the Kondo resonance atthe impurity site exists for all $N \geq 2$. The approach removes the pathologyin the standard EOM for N=2, and has the same level of applicability asnon-crossing approximation. For N=2, an exchange field splits the Kondoresonance into only two peaks, consist with the result from more rigorousnumerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The temperature dependence of theKondo resonance peak is also discussed.

Determination of Boiling Range of Xylene Mixed in PX Device Using  Artificial Neural Networks

  Determination of boiling range of xylene mixed in PX device is currently acrucial topic in the practical applications because of the recent disputes ofPX project in China. In our study, instead of determining the boiling range ofxylene mixed by traditional approach in laboratory or industry, we successfullyestablished two Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models to determine theinitial boiling point and final boiling point respectively. Results show thatthe Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks (MLFN) model with 7 nodes (MLFN-7)is the best model to determine the initial boiling point of xylene mixed, withthe RMS error 0.18; while the MLFN model with 4 nodes (MLFN-4) is the bestmodel to determine the final boiling point of xylene mixed, with the RMS error0.75. The training and testing processes both indicate that the models wedeveloped are robust and precise. Our research can effectively avoid the damageof the PX device to human body and environment.

A Random Access Reconfigurable Metamaterial and a Tunable Flat Lens

  The ability to control resonant properties of individual metamolecule in ametamaterial structure will offer an ultimate freedom for dynamically shapingwavefronts of electromagnetic radiation for applications such as variableaberration corrected planar lenses, dynamic holograms and spatial intensity andphase modulators. Here we report the first demonstration of a metamaterialwhere resonant properties of every individual metamolecule can be continuouslycontrolled at will thus offering an ultimate freedom in achieving a dynamiccontrol of electromagnetic wavefront of microwave radiation. We call this aRandom Access Reconfigurable Metamaterial (RARM). To achieve a RARM we createdan array of cavities that were filled with liquid metal in a precise fashionusing microfluidic technology. The developed RARM was used provide the firstdemonstration of a tunable flat lens.

Learning to Start for Sequence to Sequence Architecture

  The sequence to sequence architecture is widely used in the responsegeneration and neural machine translation to model the potential relationshipbetween two sentences. It typically consists of two parts: an encoder thatreads from the source sentence and a decoder that generates the target sentenceword by word according to the encoder's output and the last generated word.However, it faces to the cold start problem when generating the first word asthere is no previous word to refer. Existing work mainly use a special startsymbol </s>to generate the first word. An obvious drawback of these work isthat there is not a learnable relationship between words and the start symbol.Furthermore, it may lead to the error accumulation for decoding when the firstword is incorrectly generated. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach tolearning to generate the first word in the sequence to sequence architecturerather than using the start symbol. Experimental results on the task ofresponse generation of short text conversation show that the proposed approachoutperforms the state-of-the-art approach in both of the automatic and manualevaluations.

Surface-Plasmon-Polariton Laser based on an Open-Cavity Fabry-Perot  Resonator

  Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the development ofsmall-footprint lasers for potential applications in small-volume sensing andon-chip optical communications. Surface-plasmons, electromagnetic modesevanescently confined to metal-dielectric interfaces, offer an effective routeto achieving lasing at nanometer-scale dimensions when resonantly amplified incontact with a gain-medium. Here, we achieve visible frequency ultra-narrowlinewidth lasing at room-temperature by leveraging surface plasmons propagatingin an open Fabry-Perot cavity formed by a flat metal surface coated with asubwavelength-thick layer of optically-pumped gain medium and orthogonallybound by a pair of flat metal sidewalls. Low perturbationtransmission-configuration sampling of the lasing plasmon mode is achieved viaan evanescently coupled recessed nanoslit, opening the way tohigh-figure-of-merit refractive-index sensing of analytes interacting with theopen cavity.

Learn and Pick Right Nodes to Offload

  Task offloading is a promising technology to exploit the benefits of fogcomputing. An effective task offloading strategy is needed to utilize thecomputational resources efficiently. In this paper, we endeavor to seek anonline task offloading strategy to minimize the long-term latency. Inparticular, we formulate a stochastic programming problem, where theexpectations of the system parameters change abruptly at unknown time instants.Meanwhile, we consider the fact that the queried nodes can only feed back theprocessing results after finishing the tasks. We then put forward an effectivealgorithm to solve this challenging stochastic programming under thenon-stationary bandit model. We further prove that our proposed algorithm isasymptotically optimal in a non-stationary fog-enabled network. Numericalsimulations are carried out to corroborate our designs.

CDF Transform-Shift: An effective way to deal with inhomogeneous density  datasets

  Many distance-based algorithms exhibit bias towards dense clusters ininhomogeneous datasets (i.e., those which contain clusters in both dense andsparse regions of the space). For example, density-based clustering algorithmstend to join neighbouring dense clusters together into a single group in thepresence of a sparse cluster; while distance-based anomaly detectors exhibitdifficulty in detecting local anomalies which are close to a dense cluster indatasets also containing sparse clusters. In this paper, we propose the CDFTransform-Shift (CDF-TS) algorithm which is based on a multi-dimensionalCumulative Distribution Function (CDF) transformation. It effectively convertsa dataset with clusters of inhomogeneous density to one with clusters ofhomogeneous density, i.e., the data distribution is converted to one in whichall locally low/high-density locations become globally low/high-densitylocations. Thus, after performing the proposed Transform-Shift, a single globaldensity threshold can be used to separate the data into clusters and theirsurrounding noise points. Our empirical evaluations show that CDF-TS overcomesthe shortcomings of existing density-based clustering and distance-basedanomaly detection algorithms and significantly improves their performance.

Hierarchical clustering that takes advantage of both density-peak and  density-connectivity

  This paper focuses on density-based clustering, particularly the Density Peak(DP) algorithm and the one based on density-connectivity DBSCAN; and proposes anew method which takes advantage of the individual strengths of these twomethods to yield a density-based hierarchical clustering algorithm. Ourinvestigation begins with formally defining the types of clusters DP and DBSCANare designed to detect; and then identifies the kinds of distributions that DPand DBSCAN individually fail to detect all clusters in a dataset. Theseidentified weaknesses inspire us to formally define a new kind of clusters andpropose a new method called DC-HDP to overcome these weaknesses to identifyclusters with arbitrary shapes and varied densities. In addition, the newmethod produces a richer clustering result in terms of hierarchy or dendrogramfor better cluster structures understanding. Our empirical evaluation resultsshow that DC-HDP produces the best clustering results on 14 datasets incomparison with 7 state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

Effect of unitary impurities in non-STM-types of tunneling in high-T_c  superconductors

  Based on an extended Hubbard model, we present calculations of both the local(i.e., single-site) and spatially-averaged differential tunneling conductancein d-wave superconductors containing nonmagnetic impurities in the unitarylimit. Our results show that a random distribution of unitary impurities of anyconcentration can at most give rise to a finite zero-bias conductance (with nopeak there) in spatially-averaged non-STM type of tunneling, in spite of thefact that local tunneling in the immediate vicinity of an isolated impuritydoes show a conductance peak at zero bias, whereas to give rise to even a smallzero-bias conductance peak in the former type of tunneling the impurities mustform dimers, trimers, etc. along the [110] directions. In addition, we findthat the most-recently-observed novel pattern of the tunneling conductancearound a single impurity by Pan et al. [Nature (London) 403,746 (2000)] can beexplained in terms of a realistic model of the tunneling configuration whichgives rise to the experimental results reported there. The key feature in thismodel is the blocking effect of the BiO and SrO layers which exist between thetunneling tip and the CuO_2 layer being probed.

Vortex core states in a minimal two-band model for iron-based  superconductors

  The pairing symmetry is one of the major issues in the study of iron-basedsuperconductors. We adopt a minimal two-band tight-binding model with variouschannels of pairing interaction, and derive a set of two-band Bogoliubov-deGennes (BdG) equations. The BdG equations are implemented in real space andthen solved self-consistently via exact diagonalization. In the uniform case,we find that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state is most favorable for anearest-neighbor pairing interaction while the $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave pairing stateis most favorable for a next-nearest-neighbor pairing interaction. The isconsistent with that reported by Seo {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101},206404 (2008)]. We then proceed to study the local electronic structure arounda magnetic vortex core for both $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s_{x^2y^2}$-wavepairing symmetry in the mixed state. It is found from the local density ofstates (LDOS) spectra and its spatial variation that the resonance core statesnear the Fermi energy for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry are boundwhile those for the $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry can evolve from thelocalized states into extended ones with varying electron filling factor.Furthermore, by including an effective exchange interaction, the emergentantiferromagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) order can suppress the resonance corestates, which provides one possible avenue to understand the absence ofresonance peak as revealed by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment(STM) by Yin {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 102}, 097002 (2009)].

SOAP3-dp: Fast, Accurate and Sensitive GPU-based Short Read Aligner

  To tackle the exponentially increasing throughput of Next-GenerationSequencing (NGS), most of the existing short-read aligners can be configured tofavor speed in trade of accuracy and sensitivity. SOAP3-dp, through leveragingthe computational power of both CPU and GPU with optimized algorithms, delivershigh speed and sensitivity simultaneously. Compared with widely adoptedaligners including BWA, Bowtie2, SeqAlto, GEM and GPU-based aligners includingBarraCUDA and CUSHAW, SOAP3-dp is two to tens of times faster, whilemaintaining the highest sensitivity and lowest false discovery rate (FDR) onIllumina reads with different lengths. Transcending its predecessor SOAP3,which does not allow gapped alignment, SOAP3-dp by default tolerates alignmentsimilarity as low as 60 percent. Real data evaluation using human genomedemonstrates SOAP3-dp's power to enable more authentic variants and longerIndels to be discovered. Fosmid sequencing shows a 9.1 percent FDR on newlydiscovered deletions. SOAP3-dp natively supports BAM file format and provides ascoring scheme same as BWA, which enables it to be integrated into existinganalysis pipelines. SOAP3-dp has been deployed on Amazon-EC2, NIH-Biowulf andTianhe-1A.

Protein Inference and Protein Quantification: Two Sides of the Same Coin

  Motivation: In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, proteinquantification and protein identification are two major computational problems.To quantify the protein abundance, a list of proteins must be firstly inferredfrom the sample. Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimatedwith quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, researchershave been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, they are twosides of same coin in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteinswith non-zero abundances. Then, one interesting question is if we regard theprotein inference problem as a special protein quantification problem, is itpossible to achieve better protein inference performance?  Contribution: In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using proteinquantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Proteininference is to determine whether each candidate protein is present in thesample or not. Protein quantification is to calculate the abundance of eachprotein. Naturally, the absent proteins should have zero abundances. Thus, weargue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special case ofprotein quantification problem: present proteins are those proteins withnon-zero abundances. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three verysimple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problemeffectively.  Results: The experimental results on six datasets show that these threemethods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms. Thisdemonstrates that it is plausible to take the protein inference problem as aspecial case of protein quantification, which opens the door of devising moreeffective protein inference algorithms from a quantification perspective.

Vortex Charges in High Temperature Superconductors

  Based on an effective model Hamiltonian with competing antiferromagnetic (AF)and d-wave superconductivity (DSC) interactions, the vortex charge in high T_csuperconductors is investigated by solving self-consistently the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations. We found that the vortex charge is always negative when asufficient strength of AF order is induced inside the vortex core, otherwise,the vortex charge is positive. By tuning the on-site Coulomb repulsion U or thedoping parameter $\delta$, a transition between the positive and negativevortex charges may occur. The vortex charge at optimal doping has also beenstudied as a function of magnetic field. Recent NMR and Hall effect experimentsmay be understood in terms of the present results. New imaging experimentsshould be able to probe the vortex charge directly.

Canonical explicit Bäcklund transformations with spectrality for  constrained flows of soliton hierarchies

  It is shown that explicit B\"{a}cklund transformations (BTs) for thehigh-order constrained flows of soliton hierarchy can be constructed via theirDarboux transformations and Lax representation, and these BTs are canonicaltransformations including B\"{a}cklund parameter $\eta$ and possess aspectrality property with respect to $\eta$ and the 'conjugated' variable $\mu$for which the pair $(\eta, \mu)$ lies on the spectral curve. As model wepresent the canonical explicit BTs with the spectrality for high-orderconstrained flows of the Kaup-Newell hierarchy and the KdV hierarchy.

Impurity effect as a probe for order parameter symmetry in iron-based  superconductors

  The pointlike impurity scattering is studied for a superconductor withdifferent pairing symmetries based on a minimal two band model proposed by S.Raghu $et$ $al.$ [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 77}, R220503 (2008)], and theself-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Two intra-gap resonance peaksare found at or near the nonmagnetic impurity site for a typical $s_{x^2y^2}$symmetry and strong scattering potentials. Such intra-gap resonance peaks areabsent for the sign unchanged s-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave order parameter.Thus we propose that a non-magnetic impurity with strong scattering potentialscan be used to probe the pairing symmetry in iron-based superconductors.

Pairing Symmetry in Iron-Pnictide Superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$

  The pairing symmetry is one of the major issues in the study of iron-basedsuperconductors. We adopt a low-energy effective kinetic model based on thefirst-principles band structure calculations combined with the $J_1$-$J_2$model for KFe$_2$As$_2$, the phase diagram of pairing symmetries isconstructed. Putting the values of $J_1$ and $J_2$ of the $J_1$-$J_2$ modelobtained by the first-principles calculations into this phase diagram, we findthat the pairing symmetry for KFe$_2$As$_2$ is a nodal $d_{xy}$-wave in thefolded Brillouin zone with two iron atoms per unit cell. This is in goodagreement with experiments observed a nodal order parameter.

Terahertz conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene

  Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, the real part of opticalconductivity [$\sigma_{1}(\omega)$] of twisted bilayer graphene was obtained atdifferent temperatures (10 -- 300 K) in the frequency range 0.3 -- 3 THz. Ontop of a Drude-like response, we see a strong peak in $\sigma_{1} (\omega)$ at$\sim$2.7 THz. We analyze the overall Drude-like response using adisorder-dependent (unitary scattering) model, then attribute the peak at 2.7THz to an enhanced density of states at that energy, that is caused by thepresence of a van Hove singularity arising from a commensurate twisting of thetwo graphene layers.

Phase diagram of doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ superconductor under broken $C_4$  symmetry

  We develop a minimal multiorbital tight-binding model with realistic hoppingparameters. The model breaks the symmetry of the tetragonal point group bylowering it from $C_4$ to $D_{2d}$, which accurately describes the Fermisurface evolution of the electron-doped BaFe$_{2-x}$Co$_x$As$_2$ and hole-dopedBa$_{1-y}$K$_y$Fe$_2$As$_2$ compounds. An investigation of the phase diagramwith a mean-field $t$-$U$-$V$ Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian results inagreement with the experimentally observed electron- and hole-doped phasediagram with only one set of $t$, $U$ and $V$ parameters. Additionally, theself-consistently calculated superconducting order parameter exhibits$s^\pm$-wave pairing symmetry with a small d-wave pairing admixture in theentire doping range, % The superconducting $s^\pm + d$-wave order parameterwhich is the subtle result of the weakly broken symmetry and competinginteractions in the multiorbital mean-field Hamiltonian.

Pressure induced topological quantum phase transition in Sb_2Se_3

  Based on the first-principles band structure calculations, we investigate theeffects of hydrostatic pressure on the conventional insulator (CI) Sb_2Se_3 andpredict that it undergoes a topological quantum phase transition from a CI to anontrivial topological insulator at a critical pressure value. Thepressure-induced topological quantum phase transition is confirmed bycalculating the evolution of the bulk energy gap as a function of pressure, theinversion of energy band structure, and the Z_2 topological invariant, as wellas the existence of the Dirac-like topological surface states. Our predictionscan be tested by both spectroscopy and transport experiments.

Superfluid density in the $s_{\pm}$-wave state of clean iron-based  superconductors

  Based on a phenomenological model and the Kubo formula, we investigate thesuperfluid density $\rho_s(T)$ and then the penetration depth $\lambda(T)$ ofthe iron-based superconductors in the coexistence region of thespin-density-wave(SDW) and superconductivity, and also in the over-dopedregion. Our calculations show a dramatic increase of $\lambda(0)$ with thedecrease of the doping concentration $x$ below $x=0.1$. This result isconsistent with the experimental observations. At low temperatures, $\rho(T)$shows an exponential-law behavior, while at higher temperatures, thelinear-in-$T$ behavior is dominant before it trends to vanish. The evolution of$\Delta\lambda(T)$ can be roughly fitted by a exponential function at overdopedlevels while in other doping range it is a power-law function with the exponentdepending on the doping concentration. We show that the Uemura relation holdsfor the iron-based superconductors only at very low doping levels.

Evolution of the Fermi surface topology in doped 122 iron pnictides

  Based on the minimum two-orbital model and the phase diagram recentlyproposed by Tai et al.\ (Europhys. Lett. \textbf{103}, 67001(2013)) for bothelectron- and hole-doped 122 iron-based superconducting compounds, we use theBogoliubov-de Gennes equations to perform a comprehensive investigation of theevolution of the Fermi surface (FS) topology in the presence of the collinearspin-density-wave (SDW) order as the doping is changed. In the parent compound,the ground state is the SDW order, where the FS is not completely gapped, andtwo types of Dirac cones, one electron-doped and the other hole-doped emerge inthe magnetic Brillouin zone. Our findings are qualitatively consistent withrecent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and magneto-resistivitymeasurements. We also examine the FS evolution of both electron- and hole-dopedcases and compare them with measurements, as well as with those obtained byother model Hamiltonians.

Planar Lenses at Visible Wavelengths

  Sub-wavelength resolution imaging requires high numerical aperture (NA)lenses, which are bulky and expensive. Metasurfaces allow the miniaturizationof conventional refractive optics into planar structures. We show thathigh-aspect-ratio titanium dioxide metasurfaces can be fabricated and designedas meta-lenses with NA = 0.8. Diffraction-limited focusing is demonstrated atwavelengths of 405 nm, 532 nm, and 660 nm with corresponding efficiencies of86%, 73%, and 66%. The meta-lenses can resolve nanoscale features separated bysub-wavelength distances and provide magnification as high as 170x with imagequalities comparable to a state-of-the-art commercial objective. Our resultsfirmly establish that meta-lenses can have widespread applications inlaser-based microscopy, imaging, and spectroscopy.

Local Moment Formation of an Anderson Impurity on Graphene

  We study the property of a magnetic impurity on a single-layer graphenewithin an Anderson impurity model. Due to the vanishing local density of statesat the Fermi level in graphene, the impurity spin cannot be effectivelyscreened out. Treating the problem within the Gutzwiller approximation, wefound a region in the parameter space of $U$-$E^f$ where the impurity is in thelocal moment state, which is characterized by a zero effective hybridizationbetween the bath electron and the magnetic impurity. Here $U$ is the onsiteCoulomb repulsion of the impurity electrons and $E^f$ the impurity energylevel. The competition between $U$ and $E^f$ is also discussed. While larger$U$ reduces double occupation and favors local moment formation, a deeperimpurity level prefers double occupation and a nonzero hybridization and thus aKondo screened state. For a fixed $U$, by continuously lowering the impuritylevel, the impurity first enters from a Kondo screened state into a localmoment state and then departs from this state and re-enters into the Kondoscreened state.

Edge states and local electronic structure around an adsorbed impurity  in a topological superconductor

  Recently topological superconducting states has attracted a lot of interest.In this work, we consider a topo- logical superconductor with $Z_2$ topologicalmirror order [1] and s$\pm$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry, within atwo-orbital model originally designed for iron-based superconductivity [2]. Wepredict the existence of gapless edge states. We also study the localelectronic structure around an adsorbed interstitial magnetic impurity in thesystem, and find the existence of low-energy in-gap bound states even with aweak spin polar- ization on the impurity. We also discuss the relevance of ourresults to the recent STM experiment on Fe(Te,Se) compound with adsorbed Feimpurity [3], for which our density functional calculations show the Feimpurity is spin polarized.

Chemomechanical Origin of Hydrogen Trapping at Grain Boundaries in FCC  Metals

  Hydrogen embrittlement of metals is widely observed, but its atomisticorigins remain little understood and much debated. Combining a uniqueidentification of interstitial sites through polyhedral tessellation andfirst-principles calculations, we study hydrogen adsorption at grain boundariesin a variety of face-centered cubic metals of Ni, Cu, gamma-Fe and Pd. Wediscover the chemomechanical origin of variation of adsorption energetics forinterstitial hydrogen at grain boundaries. A general chemomechanical formula isestablished to provide accurate assessments of hydrogen trapping andsegregation energetics at grain boundaries, and it also offers directexplanations for certain experimental observations. The present study deepensour mechanistic understanding of the role of grain boundaries in hydrogenembrittlement, and promises a viable path towards predictive microstructureengineering against hydrogen embrittlement in structural metals.

Using Maximum Entry-Wise Deviation to Test the Goodness-of-Fit for  Stochastic Block Models

  The stochastic block model is widely used for detecting community structuresin network data. How to test the goodness-of-fit of the model is one of thefundamental problems and has gained growing interests in recent years. In thispaper, we propose a novel goodness-of-fit test based on the maximum entry ofthe centered and re-scaled adjacency matrix for the stochastic block model. Onenoticeable advantage of the proposed test is that the number of communities canbe allowed to grow linearly with the number of nodes ignoring a logarithmicfactor. We prove that the null distribution of the test statistic converges indistribution to a Gumbel distribution, and we show that both the number ofcommunities and the membership vector can be tested via the proposed method.Further, we show that the proposed test has asymptotic power guarantee againsta class of alternatives. We also demonstrate that the proposed method can beextended to the degree-corrected stochastic block model. Both simulationstudies and real-world data examples indicate that the proposed method workswell.
