Efficient Model Identification for Tensegrity Locomotion

  This paper aims to identify in a practical manner unknown physicalparameters, such as mechanical models of actuated robot links, which arecritical in dynamical robotic tasks. Key features include the use of anoff-the-shelf physics engine and the Bayesian optimization framework. The taskbeing considered is locomotion with a high-dimensional, compliant Tensegrityrobot. A key insight, in this case, is the need to project the modelidentification challenge into an appropriate lower dimensional space forefficiency. Comparisons with alternatives indicate that the proposed method canidentify the parameters more accurately within the given time budget, whichalso results in more precise locomotion control.

Scalable Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning

  Finding asymptotically-optimal paths in multi-robot motion planning problemscould be achieved, in principle, using sampling-based planners in the compositeconfiguration space of all of the robots in the space. The dimensionality ofthis space increases with the number of robots, rendering this approachimpractical. This work focuses on a scalable sampling-based planner for coupledmulti-robot problems that provides asymptotic optimality. It extends the dRRTapproach, which proposed building roadmaps for each robot and searching animplicit roadmap in the composite configuration space. This work presents a newmethod, dRRT* , and develops theory for scalable convergence to optimal pathsin multi-robot problems. Simulated experiments indicate dRRT* converges tohigh-quality paths while scaling to higher numbers of robots where the naiveapproach fails. Furthermore, dRRT* is applicable to high-dimensional problems,such as planning for robot manipulators

Efficient, High-Quality Stack Rearrangement

  This work studies rearrangement problems involving the sorting of robots orobjects in stack-like containers, which can be accessed only from one side. Twoscenarios are considered: one where every robot or object needs to reach aparticular stack, and a setting in which each robot has a distinct positionwithin a stack. In both cases, the goal is to minimize the number of stackremovals that need to be performed. Stack rearrangement is shown to beintimately connected to pebble motion problems, a useful abstraction inmulti-robot path planning. Through this connection, feasibility of stackrearrangement can be readily addressed. The paper continues to establish lowerand upper bounds on optimality, which differ only by a logarithmic factor, interms of stack removals. An algorithmic solution is then developed thatproduces suboptimal paths much quicker than a pebble motion solver.Furthermore, informed search-based methods are proposed for findinghigh-quality solutions. The efficiency and desirable scalability of the methodsis demonstrated in simulation.

Probabilistic completeness of RRT for geometric and kinodynamic planning  with forward propagation

  The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm has been one of the mostprevalent and popular motion-planning techniques for two decades now.Surprisingly, in spite of its centrality, there has been an active debate underwhich conditions RRT is probabilistically complete. We provide two new proofsof probabilistic completeness (PC) of RRT with a reduced set of assumptions.The first one for the purely geometric setting, where we only require that thesolution path has a certain clearance from the obstacles. For the kinodynamiccase with forward propagation of random controls and duration, we only considerin addition mild Lipschitz-continuity conditions. These proofs fill a gap inthe study of RRT itself. They also lay sound foundations for a variety of morerecent and alternative sampling-based methods, whose PC property relies on thatof RRT.

Adaptive Tensegrity Locomotion on Rough Terrain via Reinforcement  Learning

  The dynamical properties of tensegrity robots give them appealing ruggednessand adaptability, but present major challenges with respect to locomotioncontrol. Due to high-dimensionality and complex contact responses, data-drivenapproaches are apt for producing viable feedback policies. Guided Policy Search(GPS), a sample-efficient and model-free hybrid framework for optimization andreinforcement learning, has recently been used to produce periodic locomotionfor a spherical 6-bar tensegrity robot on flat or slightly varied surfaces.This work provides an extension to non-periodic locomotion and achieves roughterrain traversal, which requires more broadly varied, adaptive, andnon-periodic rover behavior. The contribution alters the control optimizationstep of GPS, which locally fits and exploits surrogate models of the dynamics,and employs the existing supervised learning step. The proposed solutionincorporates new processes to ensure effective local modeling despite thedisorganized nature of sample data in rough terrain locomotion. Demonstrationsin simulation reveal that the resulting controller sustains the highly adaptivebehavior necessary to reliably traverse rough terrain.

Sampling-based Roadmap Planners are Probably Near-Optimal after Finite  Computation

  Sampling-based motion planners have proven to be efficient solutions to avariety of high-dimensional, geometrically complex motion planning problemswith applications in several domains. The traditional view of these approachesis that they solve challenges efficiently by giving up formal guarantees andinstead attain asymptotic properties in terms of completeness and optimality.Recent work has argued based on Monte Carlo experiments that these approachesalso exhibit desirable probabilistic properties in terms of completeness andoptimality after finite computation. The current paper formalizes theseguarantees. It proves a formal bound on the probability that solutions returnedby asymptotically optimal roadmap-based methods (e.g., PRM*) are within a boundof the optimal path length I* with clearance {\epsilon} after a finiteiteration n. This bound has the form P(|In - I* | {\leq} {\delta}I*) {\leq}Psuccess, where {\delta} is an error term for the length a path in the PRM*graph, In. This bound is proven for general dimension Euclidean spaces andevaluated in simulation. A discussion on how this bound can be used inpractice, as well as bounds for sparse roadmaps are also provided.

Asymptotically Optimal Sampling-based Kinodynamic Planning

  Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions forhigh-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of randomgeometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achievedwith these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamicsrequires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space ofthe underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical,to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robotsor physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was evenpossible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems withoutaccess to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes howto achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incrementalsampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two newmethods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which areasymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shownto converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse setof samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance ofthe planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systemsbenchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots.

A Self-supervised Learning System for Object Detection using Physics  Simulation and Multi-view Pose Estimation

  Progress has been achieved recently in object detection given advancements indeep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount oftraining data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits theirapplicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number ofobjects and variety of conditions. This work proposes an autonomous process fortraining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection and poseestimation in robotic setups. The focus is on detecting objects placed incluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. Inparticular, given access to 3D object models, several aspects of theenvironment are physically simulated. The models are placed in physicallyrealistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeledsynthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trainsover real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimationprocess. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existingdatasets and on a dataset collected for this paper with a Motoman robotic arm.Results show that the proposed approach outperforms popular training processesrelying on synthetic - but not physically realistic - data and manualannotation. The key contributions are the incorporation of physical reasoningin the synthetic data generation process and the automation of the annotationprocess over real images.

High-Quality Tabletop Rearrangement with Overhand Grasps: Hardness  Results and Fast Methods

  This paper studies the underlying combinatorial structure of a class ofobject rearrangement problems, which appear frequently in applications. Theproblems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat,horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and performpick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the casewhere the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. Foroverlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number ofpick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by theend-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimizethe end-effector distance. While such problems do not involve all thecomplexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hardchallenges in both cases. This is shown through two-way reductions betweenwell-understood, hard combinatorial challenges and these rearrangementproblems. The benefit of the reduction is that there are well studiedalgorithms for solving these well-established combinatorial challenges. Thesealgorithms can be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. Thepaper builds on these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline fordealing with the rearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation shows that theproposed pipeline achieves high-quality paths with regards to the optimizationobjectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highly desirable scalability as the numberof objects increases in both the overlapping and non-overlapping setups.

Fast Model Identification via Physics Engines for Data-Efficient Policy  Search

  This paper presents a method for identifying mechanical parameters of robotsor objects, such as their mass and friction coefficients. Key features are theuse of off-the-shelf physics engines and the adaptation of a Bayesianoptimization technique towards minimizing the number of real-world experimentsneeded for model-based reinforcement learning. The proposed frameworkreproduces in a physics engine experiments performed on a real robot andoptimizes the model's mechanical parameters so as to match real-worldtrajectories. The optimized model is then used for learning a policy insimulation, before real-world deployment. It is well understood, however, thatit is hard to exactly reproduce real trajectories in simulation. Moreover, anear-optimal policy can be frequently found with an imperfect model. Therefore,this work proposes a strategy for identifying a model that is just good enoughto approximate the value of a locally optimal policy with a certain confidence,instead of wasting effort on identifying the most accurate model. Evaluations,performed both in simulation and on a real robotic manipulation task, indicatethat the proposed strategy results in an overall time-efficient, integratedmodel identification and learning solution, which significantly improves thedata-efficiency of existing policy search algorithms.

The reductions arealso shown to hold in the reverse direction, which enables the convenientapplication on rearrangement of well studied algorithms. These algorithms canbe very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The paper builds onthese reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for dealing with therearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation, including hardware-basedtrials, shows that the proposed pipeline computes high-quality paths withregards to the optimization objectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highlydesirable scalability as the number of objects increases in both theoverlapping and non-overlapping setup.

Towards Robust Product Packing with a Minimalistic End-Effector

  Advances in sensor technologies, object detection algorithms, planningframeworks and hardware designs have motivated the deployment of robots inwarehouse automation. A variety of such applications, like order fulfillment orpacking tasks, require picking objects from unstructured piles and carefullyarranging them in bins or containers. Desirable solutions need to be low-cost,easily deployable and controllable, making minimalistic hardware choicesdesirable. The challenge in designing an effective solution to this problemrelates to appropriately integrating multiple components, so as to achieve arobust pipeline that minimizes failure conditions. The current work proposes acomplete pipeline for solving such packing tasks, given access only to RGB-Ddata and a single robot arm with a vacuum-based end-effector, which is alsoused as a pushing finger. To achieve the desired level of robustness, three keymanipulation primitives are identified, which take advantage of the environmentand simple operations to successfully pack multiple cubic objects. The overallapproach is demonstrated to be robust to execution and perception errors. Theimpact of each manipulation primitive is evaluated by considering differentversions of the proposed pipeline, which incrementally introduce reasoningabout object poses and corrective manipulation actions.

dRRT*: Scalable and Informed Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion  Planning

  Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degreesof freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a sharedworkspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, inprinciple, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-basedplanners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in thecorresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. Thehardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of suchstructures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This workproposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, whichprovides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationallyefficient. In particular, the proposed \drrtstar\ is an informed,asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motionplanner, \drrt. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps foreach robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures inthe composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence tooptimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was notachieving. Building on this analysis, \drrt\ is first properly adapted so as toachieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make useof effective heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. Thecase where the various robots share some degrees of freedom is also studied.Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm, \drrtstar\,converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robotswhere various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner'scapability to solve problems involving multiple real-world robotic arms.

A Dataset for Improved RGBD-based Object Detection and Pose Estimation  for Warehouse Pick-and-Place

  An important logistics application of robotics involves manipulators thatpick-and-place objects placed in warehouse shelves. A critical aspect of thistask corre- sponds to detecting the pose of a known object in the shelf usingvisual data. Solving this problem can be assisted by the use of an RGB-Dsensor, which also provides depth information beyond visual data. Nevertheless,it remains a challenging problem since multiple issues need to be addressed,such as low illumination inside shelves, clutter, texture-less and reflectiveobjects as well as the limitations of depth sensors. This paper provides a newrich data set for advancing the state-of-the-art in RGBD- based 3D object poseestimation, which is focused on the challenges that arise when solvingwarehouse pick- and-place tasks. The publicly available data set includesthousands of images and corresponding ground truth data for the objects usedduring the first Amazon Picking Challenge at different poses and clutterconditions. Each image is accompanied with ground truth information to assistin the evaluation of algorithms for object detection. To show the utility ofthe data set, a recent algorithm for RGBD-based pose estimation is evaluated inthis paper. Based on the measured performance of the algorithm on the data set,various modifications and improvements are applied to increase the accuracy ofdetection. These steps can be easily applied to a variety of differentmethodologies for object pose detection and improve performance in the domainof warehouse pick-and-place.

Improving 6D Pose Estimation of Objects in Clutter via Physics-aware  Monte Carlo Tree Search

  This work proposes a process for efficiently searching over combinations ofindividual object 6D pose hypotheses in cluttered scenes, especially in casesinvolving occlusions and objects resting on each other. The initial set ofcandidate object poses is generated from state-of-the-art object detection andglobal point cloud registration techniques. The best-scored pose per object byusing these techniques may not be accurate due to overlaps and occlusions.Nevertheless, experimental indications provided in this work show that objectposes with lower ranks may be closer to the real poses than ones with highranks according to registration techniques. This motivates a globaloptimization process for improving these poses by taking into accountscene-level physical interactions between objects. It also implies that theCartesian product of candidate poses for interacting objects must be searchedso as to identify the best scene-level hypothesis. To perform the searchefficiently, the candidate poses for each object are clustered so as to reducetheir number but still keep a sufficient diversity. Then, searching over thecombinations of candidate object poses is performed through a Monte Carlo TreeSearch (MCTS) process that uses the similarity between the observed depth imageof the scene and a rendering of the scene given the hypothesized pose as ascore that guides the search procedure. MCTS handles in a principled way thetradeoff between fine-tuning the most promising poses and exploring new ones,by using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique. Experimental resultsindicate that this process is able to quickly identify in cluttered scenesphysically-consistent object poses that are significantly closer to groundtruth compared to poses found by point cloud registration methods.

Pushing the Boundaries of Asymptotic Optimality for Sampling-based  Roadmaps In Motion And Task Planning

  Sampling-based roadmaps have been popular methods for robot motion and taskplanning, given their generality and effectiveness in high-dimensionalconfiguration spaces (C-spaces). Following advances in random geometric graphs,a seminal analysis result argued the conditions for asymptotic optimality ofthese approaches. In particular, a connection radius for each new C-spacesample needs to be in the order of $ \gamma (\log n / n)^{1/d} $, where $n$ isthe existing number of roadmap nodes and $d$ is the dimensionality of theC-space. This prior analysis, as well as subsequent efforts, also specified asufficient lower bound for the constant $\gamma$ for asymptotic optimality. Allof these results assumed that for a finite number of samples there is a pathwith positive clearance from obstacles. Nevertheless, manipulation taskplanning requires solving problems were the start and the goal lie on theboundary of the configuration space. The current work builds on previous work,to: a) obtain an estimate of $\gamma$ in terms of a bound on the dispersion ofthe samples; and b) propose the modifications necessary to make asymptoticoptimality hold when the start and goal lie on the boundary of the C-spaceunder certain assumptions regarding the boundary. The last point generalizesthese properties to manipulation task planning and reduces the method'srequirements for a connection radius that achieves asymptotic optimality inthis domain as well as the assumptions regarding the boundary's smoothnessrelative to prior work.
