Efficient Model Identification for Tensegrity Locomotion

  This paper aims to identify in a practical manner unknown physical
parameters, such as mechanical models of actuated robot links, which are
critical in dynamical robotic tasks. Key features include the use of an
off-the-shelf physics engine and the Bayesian optimization framework. The task
being considered is locomotion with a high-dimensional, compliant Tensegrity
robot. A key insight, in this case, is the need to project the model
identification challenge into an appropriate lower dimensional space for
efficiency. Comparisons with alternatives indicate that the proposed method can
identify the parameters more accurately within the given time budget, which
also results in more precise locomotion control.


Analysis and Observations from the First Amazon Picking Challenge

  This paper presents a overview of the inaugural Amazon Picking Challenge
along with a summary of a survey conducted among the 26 participating teams.
The challenge goal was to design an autonomous robot to pick items from a
warehouse shelf. This task is currently performed by human workers, and there
is hope that robots can someday help increase efficiency and throughput while
lowering cost. We report on a 28-question survey posed to the teams to learn
about each team's background, mechanism design, perception apparatus, planning
and control approach. We identify trends in this data, correlate it with each
team's success in the competition, and discuss observations and lessons learned
based on survey results and the authors' personal experiences during the
challenge.


Scalable Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning

  Finding asymptotically-optimal paths in multi-robot motion planning problems
could be achieved, in principle, using sampling-based planners in the composite
configuration space of all of the robots in the space. The dimensionality of
this space increases with the number of robots, rendering this approach
impractical. This work focuses on a scalable sampling-based planner for coupled
multi-robot problems that provides asymptotic optimality. It extends the dRRT
approach, which proposed building roadmaps for each robot and searching an
implicit roadmap in the composite configuration space. This work presents a new
method, dRRT* , and develops theory for scalable convergence to optimal paths
in multi-robot problems. Simulated experiments indicate dRRT* converges to
high-quality paths while scaling to higher numbers of robots where the naive
approach fails. Furthermore, dRRT* is applicable to high-dimensional problems,
such as planning for robot manipulators


Efficient, High-Quality Stack Rearrangement

  This work studies rearrangement problems involving the sorting of robots or
objects in stack-like containers, which can be accessed only from one side. Two
scenarios are considered: one where every robot or object needs to reach a
particular stack, and a setting in which each robot has a distinct position
within a stack. In both cases, the goal is to minimize the number of stack
removals that need to be performed. Stack rearrangement is shown to be
intimately connected to pebble motion problems, a useful abstraction in
multi-robot path planning. Through this connection, feasibility of stack
rearrangement can be readily addressed. The paper continues to establish lower
and upper bounds on optimality, which differ only by a logarithmic factor, in
terms of stack removals. An algorithmic solution is then developed that
produces suboptimal paths much quicker than a pebble motion solver.
Furthermore, informed search-based methods are proposed for finding
high-quality solutions. The efficiency and desirable scalability of the methods
is demonstrated in simulation.


Probabilistic completeness of RRT for geometric and kinodynamic planning
  with forward propagation

  The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm has been one of the most
prevalent and popular motion-planning techniques for two decades now.
Surprisingly, in spite of its centrality, there has been an active debate under
which conditions RRT is probabilistically complete. We provide two new proofs
of probabilistic completeness (PC) of RRT with a reduced set of assumptions.
The first one for the purely geometric setting, where we only require that the
solution path has a certain clearance from the obstacles. For the kinodynamic
case with forward propagation of random controls and duration, we only consider
in addition mild Lipschitz-continuity conditions. These proofs fill a gap in
the study of RRT itself. They also lay sound foundations for a variety of more
recent and alternative sampling-based methods, whose PC property relies on that
of RRT.


Adaptive Tensegrity Locomotion on Rough Terrain via Reinforcement
  Learning

  The dynamical properties of tensegrity robots give them appealing ruggedness
and adaptability, but present major challenges with respect to locomotion
control. Due to high-dimensionality and complex contact responses, data-driven
approaches are apt for producing viable feedback policies. Guided Policy Search
(GPS), a sample-efficient and model-free hybrid framework for optimization and
reinforcement learning, has recently been used to produce periodic locomotion
for a spherical 6-bar tensegrity robot on flat or slightly varied surfaces.
This work provides an extension to non-periodic locomotion and achieves rough
terrain traversal, which requires more broadly varied, adaptive, and
non-periodic rover behavior. The contribution alters the control optimization
step of GPS, which locally fits and exploits surrogate models of the dynamics,
and employs the existing supervised learning step. The proposed solution
incorporates new processes to ensure effective local modeling despite the
disorganized nature of sample data in rough terrain locomotion. Demonstrations
in simulation reveal that the resulting controller sustains the highly adaptive
behavior necessary to reliably traverse rough terrain.


Sampling-based Roadmap Planners are Probably Near-Optimal after Finite
  Computation

  Sampling-based motion planners have proven to be efficient solutions to a
variety of high-dimensional, geometrically complex motion planning problems
with applications in several domains. The traditional view of these approaches
is that they solve challenges efficiently by giving up formal guarantees and
instead attain asymptotic properties in terms of completeness and optimality.
Recent work has argued based on Monte Carlo experiments that these approaches
also exhibit desirable probabilistic properties in terms of completeness and
optimality after finite computation. The current paper formalizes these
guarantees. It proves a formal bound on the probability that solutions returned
by asymptotically optimal roadmap-based methods (e.g., PRM*) are within a bound
of the optimal path length I* with clearance {\epsilon} after a finite
iteration n. This bound has the form P(|In - I* | {\leq} {\delta}I*) {\leq}
Psuccess, where {\delta} is an error term for the length a path in the PRM*
graph, In. This bound is proven for general dimension Euclidean spaces and
evaluated in simulation. A discussion on how this bound can be used in
practice, as well as bounds for sparse roadmaps are also provided.


Asymptotically Optimal Sampling-based Kinodynamic Planning

  Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for
high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random
geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved
with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics
requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of
the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical,
to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots
or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even
possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without
access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how
to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental
sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new
methods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are
asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown
to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set
of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of
the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems
benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots.


A Self-supervised Learning System for Object Detection using Physics
  Simulation and Multi-view Pose Estimation

  Progress has been achieved recently in object detection given advancements in
deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of
training data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits their
applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number of
objects and variety of conditions. This work proposes an autonomous process for
training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection and pose
estimation in robotic setups. The focus is on detecting objects placed in
cluttered, tight environments, such as a shelf with multiple objects. In
particular, given access to 3D object models, several aspects of the
environment are physically simulated. The models are placed in physically
realistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeled
synthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trains
over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation
process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing
datasets and on a dataset collected for this paper with a Motoman robotic arm.
Results show that the proposed approach outperforms popular training processes
relying on synthetic - but not physically realistic - data and manual
annotation. The key contributions are the incorporation of physical reasoning
in the synthetic data generation process and the automation of the annotation
process over real images.


High-Quality Tabletop Rearrangement with Overhand Grasps: Hardness
  Results and Fast Methods

  This paper studies the underlying combinatorial structure of a class of
object rearrangement problems, which appear frequently in applications. The
problems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat,
horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and perform
pick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the case
where the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. For
overlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number of
pick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by the
end-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimize
the end-effector distance. While such problems do not involve all the
complexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hard
challenges in both cases. This is shown through two-way reductions between
well-understood, hard combinatorial challenges and these rearrangement
problems. The benefit of the reduction is that there are well studied
algorithms for solving these well-established combinatorial challenges. These
algorithms can be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The
paper builds on these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for
dealing with the rearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation shows that the
proposed pipeline achieves high-quality paths with regards to the optimization
objectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highly desirable scalability as the number
of objects increases in both the overlapping and non-overlapping setups.


Fast Model Identification via Physics Engines for Data-Efficient Policy
  Search

  This paper presents a method for identifying mechanical parameters of robots
or objects, such as their mass and friction coefficients. Key features are the
use of off-the-shelf physics engines and the adaptation of a Bayesian
optimization technique towards minimizing the number of real-world experiments
needed for model-based reinforcement learning. The proposed framework
reproduces in a physics engine experiments performed on a real robot and
optimizes the model's mechanical parameters so as to match real-world
trajectories. The optimized model is then used for learning a policy in
simulation, before real-world deployment. It is well understood, however, that
it is hard to exactly reproduce real trajectories in simulation. Moreover, a
near-optimal policy can be frequently found with an imperfect model. Therefore,
this work proposes a strategy for identifying a model that is just good enough
to approximate the value of a locally optimal policy with a certain confidence,
instead of wasting effort on identifying the most accurate model. Evaluations,
performed both in simulation and on a real robotic manipulation task, indicate
that the proposed strategy results in an overall time-efficient, integrated
model identification and learning solution, which significantly improves the
data-efficiency of existing policy search algorithms.


Complexity Results and Fast Methods for Optimal Tabletop Rearrangement
  with Overhand Grasps

  This paper studies the underlying combinatorial structure of a class of
object rearrangement problems, which appear frequently in applications. The
problems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat,
horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and perform
pick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the case
where the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. For
overlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number of
pick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by the
end-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimize
the travel distance of the end-effector. While such problems do not involve all
the complexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hard in
both cases. This is shown through reductions from well-understood, hard
combinatorial challenges to these rearrangement problems. The reductions are
also shown to hold in the reverse direction, which enables the convenient
application on rearrangement of well studied algorithms. These algorithms can
be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The paper builds on
these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for dealing with the
rearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation, including hardware-based
trials, shows that the proposed pipeline computes high-quality paths with
regards to the optimization objectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highly
desirable scalability as the number of objects increases in both the
overlapping and non-overlapping setup.


Towards Robust Product Packing with a Minimalistic End-Effector

  Advances in sensor technologies, object detection algorithms, planning
frameworks and hardware designs have motivated the deployment of robots in
warehouse automation. A variety of such applications, like order fulfillment or
packing tasks, require picking objects from unstructured piles and carefully
arranging them in bins or containers. Desirable solutions need to be low-cost,
easily deployable and controllable, making minimalistic hardware choices
desirable. The challenge in designing an effective solution to this problem
relates to appropriately integrating multiple components, so as to achieve a
robust pipeline that minimizes failure conditions. The current work proposes a
complete pipeline for solving such packing tasks, given access only to RGB-D
data and a single robot arm with a vacuum-based end-effector, which is also
used as a pushing finger. To achieve the desired level of robustness, three key
manipulation primitives are identified, which take advantage of the environment
and simple operations to successfully pack multiple cubic objects. The overall
approach is demonstrated to be robust to execution and perception errors. The
impact of each manipulation primitive is evaluated by considering different
versions of the proposed pipeline, which incrementally introduce reasoning
about object poses and corrective manipulation actions.


dRRT*: Scalable and Informed Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion
  Planning

  Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degrees
of freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared
workspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, in
principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-based
planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the
corresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The
hardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of such
structures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This work
proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which
provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally
efficient. In particular, the proposed \drrtstar\ is an informed,
asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motion
planner, \drrt. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps for
each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in
the composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to
optimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was not
achieving. Building on this analysis, \drrt\ is first properly adapted so as to
achieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make use
of effective heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. The
case where the various robots share some degrees of freedom is also studied.
Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm, \drrtstar\,
converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robots
where various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner's
capability to solve problems involving multiple real-world robotic arms.


A Dataset for Improved RGBD-based Object Detection and Pose Estimation
  for Warehouse Pick-and-Place

  An important logistics application of robotics involves manipulators that
pick-and-place objects placed in warehouse shelves. A critical aspect of this
task corre- sponds to detecting the pose of a known object in the shelf using
visual data. Solving this problem can be assisted by the use of an RGB-D
sensor, which also provides depth information beyond visual data. Nevertheless,
it remains a challenging problem since multiple issues need to be addressed,
such as low illumination inside shelves, clutter, texture-less and reflective
objects as well as the limitations of depth sensors. This paper provides a new
rich data set for advancing the state-of-the-art in RGBD- based 3D object pose
estimation, which is focused on the challenges that arise when solving
warehouse pick- and-place tasks. The publicly available data set includes
thousands of images and corresponding ground truth data for the objects used
during the first Amazon Picking Challenge at different poses and clutter
conditions. Each image is accompanied with ground truth information to assist
in the evaluation of algorithms for object detection. To show the utility of
the data set, a recent algorithm for RGBD-based pose estimation is evaluated in
this paper. Based on the measured performance of the algorithm on the data set,
various modifications and improvements are applied to increase the accuracy of
detection. These steps can be easily applied to a variety of different
methodologies for object pose detection and improve performance in the domain
of warehouse pick-and-place.


Improving 6D Pose Estimation of Objects in Clutter via Physics-aware
  Monte Carlo Tree Search

  This work proposes a process for efficiently searching over combinations of
individual object 6D pose hypotheses in cluttered scenes, especially in cases
involving occlusions and objects resting on each other. The initial set of
candidate object poses is generated from state-of-the-art object detection and
global point cloud registration techniques. The best-scored pose per object by
using these techniques may not be accurate due to overlaps and occlusions.
Nevertheless, experimental indications provided in this work show that object
poses with lower ranks may be closer to the real poses than ones with high
ranks according to registration techniques. This motivates a global
optimization process for improving these poses by taking into account
scene-level physical interactions between objects. It also implies that the
Cartesian product of candidate poses for interacting objects must be searched
so as to identify the best scene-level hypothesis. To perform the search
efficiently, the candidate poses for each object are clustered so as to reduce
their number but still keep a sufficient diversity. Then, searching over the
combinations of candidate object poses is performed through a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) process that uses the similarity between the observed depth image
of the scene and a rendering of the scene given the hypothesized pose as a
score that guides the search procedure. MCTS handles in a principled way the
tradeoff between fine-tuning the most promising poses and exploring new ones,
by using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique. Experimental results
indicate that this process is able to quickly identify in cluttered scenes
physically-consistent object poses that are significantly closer to ground
truth compared to poses found by point cloud registration methods.


Pushing the Boundaries of Asymptotic Optimality for Sampling-based
  Roadmaps In Motion And Task Planning

  Sampling-based roadmaps have been popular methods for robot motion and task
planning, given their generality and effectiveness in high-dimensional
configuration spaces (C-spaces). Following advances in random geometric graphs,
a seminal analysis result argued the conditions for asymptotic optimality of
these approaches. In particular, a connection radius for each new C-space
sample needs to be in the order of $ \gamma (\log n / n)^{1/d} $, where $n$ is
the existing number of roadmap nodes and $d$ is the dimensionality of the
C-space. This prior analysis, as well as subsequent efforts, also specified a
sufficient lower bound for the constant $\gamma$ for asymptotic optimality. All
of these results assumed that for a finite number of samples there is a path
with positive clearance from obstacles. Nevertheless, manipulation task
planning requires solving problems were the start and the goal lie on the
boundary of the configuration space. The current work builds on previous work,
to: a) obtain an estimate of $\gamma$ in terms of a bound on the dispersion of
the samples; and b) propose the modifications necessary to make asymptotic
optimality hold when the start and goal lie on the boundary of the C-space
under certain assumptions regarding the boundary. The last point generalizes
these properties to manipulation task planning and reduces the method's
requirements for a connection radius that achieves asymptotic optimality in
this domain as well as the assumptions regarding the boundary's smoothness
relative to prior work.
