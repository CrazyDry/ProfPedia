Near-Optimal Online Algorithms for Dynamic Resource Allocation Problems

  In this paper, we study a general online linear programming problem whoseformulation encompasses many practical dynamic resource allocation problems,including internet advertising display applications, revenue management,various routing, packing, and auction problems. We propose a model, which undermild assumptions, allows us to design near-optimal learning-based onlinealgorithms that do not require the a priori knowledge about the total number ofonline requests to come, a first of its kind. We then consider two variants ofthe problem that relax the initial assumptions imposed on the proposed model.

Log-Quadratic Bounds for the Gaussian Q-function

  We present bounds of quadratic form for the logarithm of the GaussianQ-function. We also show an analytical method for deriving log-quadraticapproximations of the Q-function and give an approximation with absolute errorless than $10^{-3}$.

Exponential Convergence Rates for Stochastically Ordered Markov  Processes with Random Initial Conditions

  In this brief paper we find computable exponential convergence rates for alarge class of stochastically ordered Markov processes. We extend the result ofLund, Meyn, and Tweedie (1996), who found exponential convergence rates forstochastically ordered Markov processes starting from a fixed initial state, byallowing for a random initial condition that is also stochastically ordered.Our bounds are formulated in terms of moment-generating functions of hittingtimes. To illustrate our result, we find an explicit exponential convergencerate for an M/M/1 queue beginning in equilibrium and then experiencing a changein its arrival or departure rates, a setting which has not been studied to ourknowledge.

Kidney Exchange in Dynamic Sparse Heterogenous Pools

  Current kidney exchange pools are of moderate size and thin, as they consistof many highly sensitized patients. Creating a thicker pool can be done bywaiting for many pairs to arrive. We analyze a simple class of matchingalgorithms that search periodically for allocations. We find that if only 2-waycycles are conducted, in order to gain a significant amount of matches over theonline scenario (matching each time a new incompatible pair joins the pool) thewaiting period should be "very long". If 3-way cycles are also allowed we findregimes in which waiting for a short period also increases the number ofmatches considerably. Finally, a significant increase of matches can beobtained by using even one non-simultaneous chain while still matching in anonline fashion. Our theoretical findings and data-driven computationalexperiments lead to policy recommendations.

Average-Case Performance of Rollout Algorithms for Knapsack Problems

  Rollout algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance on a variety ofdynamic and discrete optimization problems. Interpreted as an approximatedynamic programming algorithm, a rollout algorithm estimates the value-to-go ateach decision stage by simulating future events while following a greedypolicy, referred to as the base policy. While in many cases rollout algorithmsare guaranteed to perform as well as their base policies, there have been fewtheoretical results showing additional improvement in performance. In thispaper we perform a probabilistic analysis of the subset sum problem andknapsack problem, giving theoretical evidence that rollout algorithms performstrictly better than their base policies. Using a stochastic model from theexisting literature, we analyze two rollout methods that we refer to as theconsecutive rollout and exhaustive rollout, both of which employ a simplegreedy base policy. For the subset sum problem, we prove that after only asingle iteration of the rollout algorithm, both methods yield at least a 30%reduction in the expected gap between the solution value and capacity, relativeto the base policy. Analogous results are shown for the knapsack problem.

Parallel Gaussian Process Regression with Low-Rank Covariance Matrix  Approximations

  Gaussian processes (GP) are Bayesian non-parametric models that are widelyused for probabilistic regression. Unfortunately, it cannot scale well withlarge data nor perform real-time predictions due to its cubic time cost in thedata size. This paper presents two parallel GP regression methods that exploitlow-rank covariance matrix approximations for distributing the computationalload among parallel machines to achieve time efficiency and scalability. Wetheoretically guarantee the predictive performances of our proposed parallelGPs to be equivalent to that of some centralized approximate GP regressionmethods: The computation of their centralized counterparts can be distributedamong parallel machines, hence achieving greater time efficiency andscalability. We analytically compare the properties of our parallel GPs such astime, space, and communication complexity. Empirical evaluation on tworeal-world datasets in a cluster of 20 computing nodes shows that our parallelGPs are significantly more time-efficient and scalable than their centralizedcounterparts and exact/full GP while achieving predictive performancescomparable to full GP.

Digital breadcrumbs: Detecting urban mobility patterns and transport  mode choices from cellphone networks

  Many modern and growing cities are facing declines in public transport usage,with few efficient methods to explain why. In this article, we show that urbanmobility patterns and transport mode choices can be derived from cellphone calldetail records coupled with public transport data recorded from smart cards.Specifically, we present new data mining approaches to determine the spatialand temporal variability of public and private transportation usage andtransport mode preferences across Singapore. Our results, which were validatedby Singapore's quadriennial Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS), revealedthat there are 3.5 (HITS: 3.5 million) million and 4.3 (HITS: 4.4 million)million inter-district passengers by public and private transport,respectively. Along with classifying which transportation connections are weakor underserved, the analysis shows that the mode share of public transport useincreases from 38 percent in the morning to 44 percent around mid-day and 52percent in the evening.

Randomized Minmax Regret for Combinatorial Optimization Under  Uncertainty

  The minmax regret problem for combinatorial optimization under uncertaintycan be viewed as a zero-sum game played between an optimizing player and anadversary, where the optimizing player selects a solution and the adversaryselects costs with the intention of maximizing the regret of the player. Theexisting minmax regret model considers only deterministic solutions/strategies,and minmax regret versions of most polynomial solvable problems are NP-hard. Inthis paper, we consider a randomized model where the optimizing player selectsa probability distribution (corresponding to a mixed strategy) over solutionsand the adversary selects costs with knowledge of the player's distribution,but not its realization. We show that under this randomized model, the minmaxregret version of any polynomial solvable combinatorial problem becomespolynomial solvable. This holds true for both the interval and discretescenario representations of uncertainty. Using the randomized model, we shownew proofs of existing approximation algorithms for the deterministic modelbased on primal-dual approaches. Finally, we prove that minmax regret problemsare NP-hard under general convex uncertainty.

A Decomposition Algorithm for Nested Resource Allocation Problems

  We propose an exact polynomial algorithm for a resource allocation problemwith convex costs and constraints on partial sums of resource consumptions, inthe presence of either continuous or integer variables. No assumption of strictconvexity or differentiability is needed. The method solves a hierarchy ofresource allocation subproblems, whose solutions are used to convertconstraints on sums of resources into bounds for separate variables at higherlevels. The resulting time complexity for the integer problem is $O(n \log m\log (B/n))$, and the complexity of obtaining an $\epsilon$-approximatesolution for the continuous case is $O(n \log m \log (B/\epsilon))$, $n$ beingthe number of variables, $m$ the number of ascending constraints (such that $m< n$), $\epsilon$ a desired precision, and $B$ the total resource. Thisalgorithm attains the best-known complexity when $m = n$, and improves it when$\log m = o(\log n)$. Extensive experimental analyses are conducted with fourrecent algorithms on various continuous problems issued from theory andpractice. The proposed method achieves a higher performance than previousalgorithms, addressing all problems with up to one million variables in lessthan one minute on a modern computer.

Robust Adaptive Routing Under Uncertainty

  We consider the problem of finding an optimal history-dependent routingstrategy on a directed graph weighted by stochastic arc costs when theobjective is to minimize the risk of spending more than a prescribed budget. Tohelp mitigate the impact of the lack of information on the arc cost probabilitydistributions, we introduce a robust counterpart where the distributions areonly known through confidence intervals on some statistics such as the mean,the mean absolute deviation, and any quantile. Leveraging recent results indistributionally robust optimization, we develop a general-purpose algorithm tocompute an approximate optimal strategy. To illustrate the benefits of therobust approach, we run numerical experiments with field data from theSingapore road network.

Managing Relocation and Delay in Container Terminals with Flexible  Service Policies

  We introduce a new model and mathematical formulation for planning cranemoves in the storage yard of container terminals. Our objective is to develop atool that captures customer centric elements, especially service time, andhelps operators to manage costly relocation moves. Our model incorporatesseveral practical details and provides port operators with expandedcapabilities including planning repositioning moves in off-peak hours,controlling wait times of each customer as well as total service time,optimizing the number of relocations and wait time jointly, and optimizingsimultaneously the container stacking and retrieval process. We also study aclass of flexible service policies which allow for out-of-order retrieval. Weshow that under such flexible policies, we can decrease the number ofrelocations and retrieval delays without creating inequities.

Logarithmic regret bounds for Bandits with Knapsacks

  Optimal regret bounds for Multi-Armed Bandit problems are now welldocumented. They can be classified into two categories based on the growth ratewith respect to the time horizon $T$: (i) small, distribution-dependent, boundsof order of magnitude $\ln(T)$ and (ii) robust, distribution-free, bounds oforder of magnitude $\sqrt{T}$. The Bandits with Knapsacks model, an extensionto the framework allowing to model resource consumption, lacks this clear-cutdistinction. While several algorithms have been shown to achieve asymptoticallyoptimal distribution-free bounds on regret, there has been little progresstoward the development of small distribution-dependent regret bounds. Wepartially bridge the gap by designing a general-purpose algorithm withdistribution-dependent regret bounds that are logarithmic in the initialendowments of resources in several important cases that cover many practicalapplications, including dynamic pricing with limited supply, bid optimizationin online advertisement auctions, and dynamic procurement.

Gaussian Process Planning with Lipschitz Continuous Reward Functions:  Towards Unifying Bayesian Optimization, Active Learning, and Beyond

  This paper presents a novel nonmyopic adaptive Gaussian process planning(GPP) framework endowed with a general class of Lipschitz continuous rewardfunctions that can unify some active learning/sensing and Bayesian optimizationcriteria and offer practitioners some flexibility to specify their desiredchoices for defining new tasks/problems. In particular, it utilizes aprincipled Bayesian sequential decision problem framework for jointly andnaturally optimizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In general, theresulting induced GPP policy cannot be derived exactly due to an uncountableset of candidate observations. A key contribution of our work here thus lies inexploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the reward functions to solve for anonmyopic adaptive epsilon-optimal GPP (epsilon-GPP) policy. To plan in realtime, we further propose an asymptotically optimal, branch-and-bound anytimevariant of epsilon-GPP with performance guarantee. We empirically demonstratethe effectiveness of our epsilon-GPP policy and its anytime variant in Bayesianoptimization and an energy harvesting task.

Solving Combinatorial Games using Products, Projections and  Lexicographically Optimal Bases

  In order to find Nash-equilibria for two-player zero-sum games where eachplayer plays combinatorial objects like spanning trees, matchings etc, weconsider two online learning algorithms: the online mirror descent (OMD)algorithm and the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm. The OMDalgorithm requires the computation of a certain Bregman projection, that hasclosed form solutions for simple convex sets like the Euclidean ball or thesimplex. However, for general polyhedra one often needs to exploit the generalmachinery of convex optimization. We give a novel primal-style algorithm forcomputing Bregman projections on the base polytopes of polymatroids. Next, inthe case of the MWU algorithm, although it scales logarithmically in the numberof pure strategies or experts $N$ in terms of regret, the algorithm takes timepolynomial in $N$; this especially becomes a problem when learningcombinatorial objects. We give a general recipe to simulate the multiplicativeweights update algorithm in time polynomial in their natural dimension. This isuseful whenever there exists a polynomial time generalized counting oracle(even if approximate) over these objects. Finally, using the combinatorialstructure of symmetric Nash-equilibria (SNE) when both players play bases ofmatroids, we show that these can be found with a single projection or convexminimization (without using online learning).

Structured Prediction by Conditional Risk Minimization

  We propose a general approach for supervised learning with structured outputspaces, such as combinatorial and polyhedral sets, that is based on minimizingestimated conditional risk functions. Given a loss function defined over pairsof output labels, we first estimate the conditional risk function by solving a(possibly infinite) collection of regularized least squares problems. Aprediction is made by solving an inference problem that minimizes the estimatedconditional risk function over the output space. We show that this approachenables, in some cases, efficient training and inference without explicitlyintroducing a convex surrogate for the original loss function, even when it isdiscontinuous. Empirical evaluations on real-world and synthetic data setsdemonstrate the effectiveness of our method in adapting to a variety of lossfunctions.

Separable Convex Optimization with Nested Lower and Upper Constraints

  We study a convex resource allocation problem in which lower and upper boundsare imposed on partial sums of allocations. This model is linked to a largerange of applications, including production planning, speed optimization,stratified sampling, support vector machines, portfolio management, andtelecommunications. We propose an efficient gradient-free divide-and-conqueralgorithm, which uses monotonicity arguments to generate valid bounds from therecursive calls, and eliminate linking constraints based on the informationfrom sub-problems. This algorithm does not need strict convexity ordifferentiability. It produces an $\epsilon$-approximate solution for thecontinuous problem in $\mathcal{O}(n \log m \log \frac{n B}{\epsilon})$ timeand an integer solution in $\mathcal{O}(n \log m \log B)$ time, where $n$ isthe number of decision variables, $m$ is the number of constraints, and $B$ isthe resource bound. A complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \log m)$ is also achievedfor the linear and quadratic cases. These are the best complexities known todate for this important problem class. Our experimental analyses confirm thegood performance of the method, which produces optimal solutions for problemswith up to 1,000,000 variables in a few seconds. Promising applications to thesupport vector ordinal regression problem are also investigated.

The Stochastic Container Relocation Problem

  The Container Relocation Problem (CRP) is concerned with finding a sequenceof moves of containers that minimizes the number of relocations needed toretrieve all containers, while respecting a given order of retrieval. However,the assumption of knowing the full retrieval order of containers isparticularly unrealistic in real operations. This paper studies the stochasticCRP (SCRP), which relaxes this assumption. A new multi-stage stochastic model,called the batch model, is introduced, motivated, and compared with an existingmodel (the online model). The two main contributions are an optimal algorithmcalled Pruning-Best-First-Search (PBFS) and a randomized approximate algorithmcalled PBFS-Approximate with a bounded average error. Both algorithms,applicable in the batch and online models, are based on a new family of lowerbounds for which we show some theoretical properties. Moreover, we introducetwo new heuristics outperforming the best existing heuristics. Algorithms,bounds and heuristics are tested in an extensive computational section.Finally, based on strong computational evidence, we conjecture the optimalityof the "Leveling" heuristic in a special "no information" case, where at anyretrieval stage, any of the remaining containers is equally likely to beretrieved next.

Signaling Game-based Misbehavior Inspection in V2I-enabled Highway  Operations

  Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications are increasingly supportinghighway operations such as electronic toll collection, carpooling, and vehicleplatooning. In this paper we study the incentives of strategic misbehavior byindividual vehicles who can exploit the security vulnerabilities in V2Icommunications and negatively impact the highway operations. We consider aV2I-enabled highway segment facing two classes of vehicles (agent populations),each with an authorized access to one server (subset of lanes). Vehicles arestrategic in that they can misreport their class (type) to the system operatorand get an unauthorized access to the server dedicated to the other class. Thismisbehavior causes additional congestion externality on the compliant vehicles,and thus, needs to be deterred. We focus on an environment where the operatoris able to inspect the vehicles for misbehavior. The inspection is costly andsuccessful detection incurs a fine on the misbehaving vehicle. We formulate asignaling game to study the strategic interaction between the vehicle classesand the operator. Our equilibrium analysis provides conditions on the costparameters that govern the vehicles' incentive to misbehave or not. We alsodetermine the operator's equilibrium inspection strategy.

Maximum Weight Online Matching with Deadlines

  We study the problem of matching agents who arrive at a marketplace over timeand leave after d time periods. Agents can only be matched while they arepresent in the marketplace. Each pair of agents can yield a different matchvalue, and the planner's goal is to maximize the total value over a finite timehorizon. First we study the case in which vertices arrive in an adversarialorder. We provide a randomized 0.25-competitive algorithm building on a resultby Feldman et al. (2009) and Lehman et al. (2006). We extend the model to thecase in which departure times are drawn independently from a distribution withnon-decreasing hazard rate, for which we establish a 1/8-competitive algorithm.  When the arrival order is chosen uniformly at random, we show that a batchingalgorithm, which computes a maximum-weighted matching every (d+1) periods, is0.279-competitive.

Probability Distributions on Partially Ordered Sets and Network Security  Games

  We consider the following problem: Does there exist a probabilitydistribution over subsets of a finite partially ordered set (poset), such thata set of constraints involving marginal probabilities of the poset's elementsand maximal chains is satisfied? In this article, we present a combinatorialalgorithm to positively resolve this question. We show that this result plays acrucial role in the equilibrium analysis of a generic security game on acapacitated flow network. The game involves a routing entity that sends itsflow through the network while facing path transportation costs, and aninterdictor who simultaneously interdicts one or more edges while facing edgeinterdiction costs. The first (resp. second) player seeks to maximize the valueof effective (resp. interdicted) flow net the total transportation (resp.interdiction) cost. Using our existence result on posets and strictcomplementary slackness in linear programming, we show that the equilibriumproperties of this game can be described using primal and dual solutions of aminimum cost circulation problem. Our analysis provides a new characterizationof the critical network components.

Decentralized Data Fusion and Active Sensing with Mobile Sensors for  Modeling and Predicting Spatiotemporal Traffic Phenomena

  The problem of modeling and predicting spatiotemporal traffic phenomena overan urban road network is important to many traffic applications such asdetecting and forecasting congestion hotspots. This paper presents adecentralized data fusion and active sensing (D2FAS) algorithm for mobilesensors to actively explore the road network to gather and assimilate the mostinformative data for predicting the traffic phenomenon. We analyze the time andcommunication complexity of D2FAS and demonstrate that it can scale well with alarge number of observations and sensors. We provide a theoretical guarantee onits predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticatedcentralized sparse approximation for the Gaussian process (GP) model: Thecomputation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be parallelized anddistributed among the mobile sensors (in a Google-like MapReduce paradigm),thereby achieving efficient and scalable prediction. We also theoreticallyguarantee its active sensing performance that improves under various practicalenvironmental conditions. Empirical evaluation on real-world urban road networkdata shows that our D2FAS algorithm is significantly more time-efficient andscalable than state-of-the-art centralized algorithms while achievingcomparable predictive performance.

Advances on Matroid Secretary Problems: Free Order Model and Laminar  Case

  The most well-known conjecture in the context of matroid secretary problemsclaims the existence of a constant-factor approximation applicable to anymatroid. Whereas this conjecture remains open, modified forms of it were shownto be true, when assuming that the assignment of weights to the secretaries isnot adversarial but uniformly random (Soto [SODA 2011], Oveis Gharan andVondr\'ak [ESA 2011]). However, so far, there was no variant of the matroidsecretary problem with adversarial weight assignment for which aconstant-factor approximation was found. We address this point by presenting a9-approximation for the \emph{free order model}, a model suggested shortlyafter the introduction of the matroid secretary problem, and for which noconstant-factor approximation was known so far. The free order model is arelaxed version of the original matroid secretary problem, with the onlydifference that one can choose the order in which secretaries are interviewed.  Furthermore, we consider the classical matroid secretary problem for thespecial case of laminar matroids. Only recently, a constant-factorapproximation has been found for this case, using a clever but rather involvedmethod and analysis (Im and Wang, [SODA 2011]) that leads to a16000/3-approximation. This is arguably the most involved special case of thematroid secretary problem for which a constant-factor approximation is known.We present a considerably simpler and stronger $3\sqrt{3}e\approx14.12$-approximation, based on reducing the problem to a matroid secretaryproblem on a partition matroid.

Greedy Online Bipartite Matching on Random Graphs

  We study the average performance of online greedy matching algorithms on$G(n,n,p)$, the random bipartite graph with $n$ vertices on each side and edgesoccurring independently with probability $p=p(n)$. In the online model,vertices on one side of the graph are given up front while vertices on theother side arrive sequentially; when a vertex arrives its edges are revealedand it must be immediately matched or dropped. We begin by analyzing the\textsc{oblivious} algorithm, which tries to match each arriving vertex to arandom neighbor, even if the neighbor has already been matched. The algorithmis shown to have a performance ratio of at least $1-1/e$ for all monotonicfunctions $p(n)$, where the performance ratio is defined asymptotically as theratio of the expected matching size given by the algorithm to the expectedmaximum matching size. Next we show that the conventional \textsc{greedy}algorithm, which assigns each vertex to a random unmatched neighbor, has aperformance ratio of at least 0.837 for all monotonic functions $p(n)$. Underthe $G(n,n,p)$ model, the performance of \textsc{greedy} is equivalent to theperformance of the well known \textsc{ranking} algorithm, so our results showthat \textsc{ranking} has a performance ratio of at least 0.837. We finallyconsider vertex-weighted bipartite matching. Our proofs are based on simpledifferential equations that describe the evolution of the matching process.

Parallel Gaussian Process Regression with Low-Rank Covariance Matrix  Approximations

  Gaussian processes (GP) are Bayesian non-parametric models that are widelyused for probabilistic regression. Unfortunately, it cannot scale well withlarge data nor perform real-time predictions due to its cubic time cost in thedata size. This paper presents two parallel GP regression methods that exploitlow-rank covariance matrix approximations for distributing the computationalload among parallel machines to achieve time efficiency and scalability. Wetheoretically guarantee the predictive performances of our proposed parallelGPs to be equivalent to that of some centralized approximate GP regressionmethods: The computation of their centralized counterparts can be distributedamong parallel machines, hence achieving greater time efficiency andscalability. We analytically compare the properties of our parallel GPs such astime, space, and communication complexity. Empirical evaluation on tworeal-world datasets in a cluster of 20 computing nodes shows that our parallelGPs are significantly more time-efficient and scalable than their centralizedcounterparts and exact/full GP while achieving predictive performancescomparable to full GP.

No-Regret Learnability for Piecewise Linear Losses

  In the convex optimization approach to online regret minimization, manymethods have been developed to guarantee a $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on regret forsubdifferentiable convex loss functions with bounded subgradients, by using areduction to linear loss functions. This suggests that linear loss functionstend to be the hardest ones to learn against, regardless of the underlyingdecision spaces. We investigate this question in a systematic fashion lookingat the interplay between the set of possible moves for both the decision makerand the adversarial environment. This allows us to highlight sharp distinctivebehaviors about the learnability of piecewise linear loss functions. On the onehand, when the decision set of the decision maker is a polyhedron, we establish$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bounds on regret for a large class of piecewise linearloss functions with important applications in online linear optimization,repeated zero-sum Stackelberg games, online prediction with side information,and online two-stage optimization. On the other hand, we exhibit $o(\sqrt{T})$learning rates, achieved by the Follow-The-Leader algorithm, in online linearoptimization when the boundary of the decision maker's decision set is curvedand when $0$ does not lie in the convex hull of the environment's decision set.Hence, the curvature of the decision maker's decision set is a determiningfactor for the optimal learning rate. These results hold in a completelyadversarial setting.

On Matching and Thickness in Heterogeneous Dynamic Markets

  We study dynamic matching in an infinite-horizon stochastic market. While allagents are potentially compatible with each other, some are hard-to-match andothers are easy-to-match. Agents prefer to be matched as soon as possible andmatches are formed either bilaterally or indirectly through chains. We adopt anasymptotic approach and compute tight bounds on the limit of waiting time ofagents under myopic policies that differ in matching technology andprioritization.  We find that the market composition is a key factor in the desired matchingtechnology and prioritization level. When hard-to-match agents arrive lessfrequently than easy-to-match ones (i) bilateral matching is almost asefficient as chains (waiting times scale similarly under both, though chainsalways outperform bilateral matching by a constant factor), and (ii) assigningpriorities to hard-to-match agents improves their waiting times. Whenhard-to-match agents arrive more frequently, chains are much more efficientthan bilateral matching and prioritization has no impact.  We further conduct comparative statics on arrival rates. Somewhatsurprisingly, we find that in a heterogeneous market and under bilateralmatching, increasing arrival rate has a non-monotone effect on waiting times,due to the fact that, under some market compositions, there is an adverseeffect of competition. Our comparative statics shed light on the impact ofmerging markets and attracting altruistic agents (that initiate chains) oreasy-to-match agents.  This work uncovers fundamental differences between heterogeneous andhomogeneous dynamic markets, and potentially helps policy makers to generateinsights on the operations of matching markets such as kidney exchangeprograms.

Stochastic Variational Inference for Bayesian Sparse Gaussian Process  Regression

  This paper presents a novel variational inference framework for deriving afamily of Bayesian sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) models whoseapproximations are variationally optimal with respect to the full-rank GPRmodel enriched with various corresponding correlation structures of theobservation noises. Our variational Bayesian SGPR (VBSGPR) models jointly treatboth the distributions of the inducing variables and hyperparameters asvariational parameters, which enables the decomposability of the variationallower bound that in turn can be exploited for stochastic optimization. Such astochastic optimization involves iteratively following the stochastic gradientof the variational lower bound to improve its estimates of the optimalvariational distributions of the inducing variables and hyperparameters (andhence the predictive distribution) of our VBSGPR models and is guaranteed toachieve asymptotic convergence to them. We show that the stochastic gradient isan unbiased estimator of the exact gradient and can be computed in constanttime per iteration, hence achieving scalability to big data. We empiricallyevaluate the performance of our proposed framework on two real-world, massivedatasets.

Maximizing Efficiency in Dynamic Matching Markets

  We study the problem of matching agents who arrive at a marketplace over timeand leave after d time periods. Agents can only be matched while they arepresent in the marketplace. Each pair of agents can yield a different matchvalue, and the planner's goal is to maximize the total value over a finite timehorizon. We study matching algorithms that perform well over any sequence ofarrivals when there is no a priori information about the match values orarrival times.  Our main contribution is a 1/4-competitive algorithm. The algorithm randomlyselects a subset of agents who will wait until right before their departure toget matched, and maintains a maximum-weight matching with respect to the otheragents. The primal-dual analysis of the algorithm hinges on a carefulcomparison between the initial dual value associated with an agent when itfirst arrives, and the final value after d time steps.  It is also shown that no algorithm is 1/2-competitive. We extend the model tothe case in which departure times are drawn i.i.d from a distribution withnon-decreasing hazard rate, and establish a 1/8-competitive algorithm in thissetting. Finally we show on real-world data that a modified version of ouralgorithm performs well in practice.

Online Resource Allocation under Partially Predictable Demand

  For online resource allocation problems, we propose a new demand arrivalmodel where the sequence of arrivals contains both an adversarial component anda stochastic one. Our model requires no demand forecasting; however, due to thepresence of the stochastic component, we can partially predict future demand asthe sequence of arrivals unfolds. Under the proposed model, we study theproblem of the online allocation of a single resource to two types ofcustomers, and design online algorithms that outperform existing ones. Ouralgorithms are adjustable to the relative size of the stochastic component, andour analysis reveals that as the portion of the stochastic component grows, theloss due to making online decisions decreases. This highlights the value of(even partial) predictability in online resource allocation. We impose noconditions on how the resource capacity scales with the maximum number ofcustomers. However, we show that using an adaptive algorithm---which makesonline decisions based on observed data---is particularly beneficial whencapacity scales linearly with the number of customers. Our work serves as afirst step in bridging the long-standing gap between the two well-studiedapproaches to the design and analysis of online algorithms based on (1)adversarial models and (2) stochastic ones. Using novel algorithm design, wedemonstrate that even if the arrival sequence contains an adversarialcomponent, we can take advantage of the limited information that the datareveals to improve allocation decisions. We also study the classical secretaryproblem under our proposed arrival model, and we show that randomizing overmultiple stopping rules may increase the probability of success.

Parallel Gaussian Process Regression for Big Data: Low-Rank  Representation Meets Markov Approximation

  The expressive power of a Gaussian process (GP) model comes at a cost of poorscalability in the data size. To improve its scalability, this paper presents alow-rank-cum-Markov approximation (LMA) of the GP model that is novel inleveraging the dual computational advantages stemming from complementing alow-rank approximate representation of the full-rank GP based on a support setof inputs with a Markov approximation of the resulting residual process; thelatter approximation is guaranteed to be closest in the Kullback-Leiblerdistance criterion subject to some constraint and is considerably more refinedthan that of existing sparse GP models utilizing low-rank representations dueto its more relaxed conditional independence assumption (especially with largerdata). As a result, our LMA method can trade off between the size of thesupport set and the order of the Markov property to (a) incur lowercomputational cost than such sparse GP models while achieving predictiveperformance comparable to them and (b) accurately represent features/patternsof any scale. Interestingly, varying the Markov order produces a spectrum ofLMAs with PIC approximation and full-rank GP at the two extremes. An advantageof our LMA method is that it is amenable to parallelization on multiplemachines/cores, thereby gaining greater scalability. Empirical evaluation onthree real-world datasets in clusters of up to 32 computing nodes shows thatour centralized and parallel LMA methods are significantly more time-efficientand scalable than state-of-the-art sparse and full-rank GP regression methodswhile achieving comparable predictive performances.

Distributed Multi-Depot Routing without Communications

  We consider and formulate a class of distributed multi-depot routingproblems, where servers are to visit a set of requests, with the aim ofminimizing the total distance travelled by all servers. These problems fallinto two categories: distributed offline routing problems where all therequests that need to be visited are known from the start; distributed onlinerouting problems where the requests come to be known incrementally. A criticaland novel feature of our formulations is that communications are not allowedamong the servers, hence posing an interesting and challenging question: whatperformance can be achieved in comparison to the best possible solutionobtained from an omniscience planner with perfect communication capabilities?The worst-case (over all possible request-set instances) performance metricsare given by the approximation ratio (offline case) and the competitive ratio(online case).  Our first result indicates that the online and offline problems areeffectively equivalent: for the same request-set instance, the approximationratio and the competitive ratio differ by at most an additive factor of 2,irrespective of the release dates in the online case. Therefore, we canrestrict our attention to the offline problem. For the offline problem, we showthat the approximation ratio given by the Voronoi partition is m (the number ofservers). For two classes of depot configurations, when the depots form a lineand when the ratios between the distances of pairs of depots are upper boundedby a sublinear function f(m) (i.e., f(m) = o(m)), we give partition schemeswith sublinear approximation ratios O(log m) and {\Theta}(f(m)) respectively.We also discuss several interesting open problems in our formulations: inparticular, how our initial results (on the two deliberately chosen classes ofdepots) shape our conjecture on the open problems.

Container Relocation Problem: Approximation, Asymptotic, and Incomplete  Information

  The Container Relocation Problem (CRP) is concerned with finding a sequenceof moves of containers that minimizes the number of relocations needed toretrieve all containers respecting a given order of retrieval. While theproblem is known to be NP-hard, certain algorithms such as the A* search andheuristics perform reasonably well on many instances of the problem. In thispaper, we first focus on the A* search algorithm, and analyze lower and upperbounds that are easy to compute and can be used to prune nodes. Our analysissheds light on which bounds result in fast computation within a givenapproximation gap. We present extensive simulation results that improve uponour theoretical analysis, and further show that our method finds the optimumsolution on most instances of medium-size bays. On "hard" instances, our methodfinds an approximate solution with a small gap and within a time frame that isfast for practical applications. We also study the average-case asymptoticbehavior of the CRP where the number of columns grows. We calculate theexpected number of relocations in the limit, and show that the optimum numberof relocations converges to a simple and intuitive lower-bound. We furtherstudy the CRP with incomplete information by relaxing the assumption that theorder of retrieval of all containers are initially known. This assumption isparticularly unrealistic in ports without an appointment system. We assume thatthe retrieval order of a subset of containers is known initially and theretrieval order of the remaining containers is observed later at a givenspecific time. Before this time, we assume a probabilistic distribution on theretrieval order of unknown containers. We combine the A* algorithm withsampling technique to solve this two-stage stochastic optimization problem. Weshow that our algorithm is fast and the error due to sampling and pruning isreasonably small.
