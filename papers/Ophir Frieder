Characterizing Question Facets for Complex Answer Retrieval

  Complex answer retrieval (CAR) is the process of retrieving answers toquestions that have multifaceted or nuanced answers. In this work, we presenttwo novel approaches for CAR based on the observation that question facets canvary in utility: from structural (facets that can apply to many similar topics,such as 'History') to topical (facets that are specific to the question'stopic, such as the 'Westward expansion' of the United States). We first explorea way to incorporate facet utility into ranking models during query term scorecombination. We then explore a general approach to reform the structure ofranking models to aid in learning of facet utility in the query-document termmatching phase. When we use our techniques with a leading neural ranker on theTREC CAR dataset, our methods rank first in the 2017 TREC CAR benchmark, andyield up to 26% higher performance than the next best method.

Overcoming low-utility facets for complex answer retrieval

  Many questions cannot be answered simply; their answers must include numerousnuanced details and additional context. Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) is theretrieval of answers to such questions. In their simplest form, these questionsare constructed from a topic entity (e.g., `cheese') and a facet (e.g., `healtheffects'). While topic matching has been thoroughly explored, we observe thatsome facets use general language that is unlikely to appear verbatim inanswers. We call these low-utility facets. In this work, we present an approachto CAR that identifies and addresses low-utility facets. We propose twoestimators of facet utility. These include exploiting the hierarchicalstructure of CAR queries and using facet frequency information from trainingdata. To improve the retrieval performance on low-utility headings, we alsoinclude entity similarity scores using knowledge graph embeddings. We apply ourapproaches to a leading neural ranking technique, and evaluate using the TRECCAR dataset. We find that our approach perform significantly better than theunmodified neural ranker and other leading CAR techniques. We also provide adetailed analysis of our results, and verify that low-utility facets are indeedmore difficult to match, and that our approach improves the performance forthese difficult queries.
