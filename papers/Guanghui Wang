Decomposing edge-colored graphs under color degree constraints

  For an edge-colored graph $G$, the minimum color degree of $G$ means theminimum number of colors on edges which are adjacent to each vertex of $G$. Weprove that if $G$ is an edge-colored graph with minimum color degree at least$5$ then $V(G)$ can be partitioned into two parts such that each part induces asubgraph with minimum color degree at least $2$. We show this theorem byproving a much stronger form. Moreover, we point out an important relationshipbetween our theorem and Bermond-Thomassen's conjecture in digraphs.

Signature Design of Sparsely Spread CDMA Based on Superposed  Constellation Distance Analysis

  Sparsely spread code division multiple access (SCDMA) is a non-orthogonalsuperposition coding scheme that permits a base station simultaneouslycommunicates with multiple users over a common channel. The detectionperformance of an SCDMA system is mainly determined by its signature matrix,which should be sparse to guarantee large Euclidean distance for the equivalentsignal constellation after spreading and superposition. Good signature matricesthat perform well under both belief prorogation and the maximum likelihooddetections are designed. The proposed design applies to several similarwell-documented schemes, including trellis code multiple access (TCMA), lowdensity spreading, and superposition modulation systems.

(2,1)-Total labeling of planar graphs with large maximum degree

  The ($d$,1)-total labelling of graphs was introduced by Havet and Yu. In thispaper, we prove that, for planar graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta\geq12$and $d=2$, the (2,1)-total labelling number $\lambda_2^T(G)$ is at most$\Delta+2$.

Antimagic orientations of even regular graphs

  A labeling of a digraph $D$ with $m$ arcs is a bijection from the set of arcsof $D$ to $\{1, \ldots, m\}$. A labeling of $D$ is antimagic if no two verticesin $D$ have the same vertex-sum, where the vertex-sum of a vertex $u\in V(D)$for a labeling is the sum of labels of all arcs entering $u$ minus the sum oflabels of all arcs leaving $u$. Motivated by the conjecture of Hartsfield andRingel from 1990 on antimagic labelings of graphs, Hefetz, M\"utze, andSchwartz [On antimagic directed graphs, J Graph Theory 64 (2010) 219--232]initiated the study of antimagic labelings of digraphs, and conjectured thatevery connected graph admits an antimagic orientation, where an orientation $D$of a graph $G$ is antimagic if $D$ has an antimagic labeling. It remainedunknown whether every disjoint union of cycles admits an antimagic orientation.In this paper, we first answer this question in the positive by proving thatevery $2$-regular graph has an antimagic orientation. We then show that for anyinteger $d\ge2$, every connected, $2d$-regular graph has an antimagicorientation. Our technique is new.

On splitting digraphs

  In 1995, Stiebitz asked the following question: For any positive integers$s,t$, is there a finite integer $f(s,t)$ such that every digraph $D$ withminimum out-degree at least $f(s,t)$ admits a bipartition $(A, B)$ such that$A$ induces a subdigraph with minimum out-degree at least $s$ and $B$ induces asubdigraph with minimum out-degree at least $t$? We give an affirmative answerfor tournaments, multipartite tournaments, and digraphs with bounded maximumin-degrees. In particular, we show that for every $\epsilon$ with$0<\epsilon<1/2$, there exists an integer $\delta_0$ such that every tournamentwith minimum out-degree at least $\delta_0$ admits a bisection $(A, B)$, sothat each vertex has at least $(1/2-\epsilon)$ of its out-neighbors in $A$, andin $B$ as well.

Dependence of transport on adatom location for armchair-edge graphene  nanoribbons

  We study the transport property for armchair-edge graphene nanoribbons(AGNRs) with an adatom coupling to a semi-infinite quantum wire. Using thenonequilibrium Green's function approach with tight-binding approximation, wedemonstrate that the tunneling current through the system is sensitivelydependent on both the AGNR width and adatom location. Interestingly, when theadatom locates onto a carbon atom in the 3$j$th chain from the edge of ametallic AGNR, the system shows a transmission gap accompanied by a thresholdvoltage in $I-V$ curve like a semiconducting AGNR. This effect may be useful inscanning tunneling microscopy experimental characterization on graphenesamples.

Two New Gradient Precondition Schemes for Full Waveform Inversion

  We propose two preconditioned gradient direction for full waveform inversion(FWI). The first one is using time integral wavefields. The Least squareproblem is formulated as the time integral residual wavefields, which canpartially resolve the effect of high-passed filter in the traditional gradientformula; the convergence rate is greatly accelerated. The other one islocalized offset Hessian inspired by the generalized imaging condition, whichprovides another redundancy in the Hessian. We compare the traditionalconjugate gradient scaled by the shot illumination and localized offset Hessian(actually, only diagonal part is considered here), and contrast theirperformance for waveform inversion. The results demonstrate the localizedoffset Hessian (diagonal part) can provide much more information in thesubsurface, and is preferred to the layer-strip inversion.

A Note on Inexact Condition for Cubic Regularized Newton's Method

  This note considers the inexact cubic-regularized Newton's method (CR), whichhas been shown in \cite{Cartis2011a} to achieve the same order-levelconvergence rate to a secondary stationary point as the exact CR\citep{Nesterov2006}. However, the inexactness condition in \cite{Cartis2011a}is not implementable due to its dependence on future iterates variable. Thisnote fixes such an issue by proving the same convergence rate for nonconvexoptimization under an inexact adaptive condition that depends on only thecurrent iterate. Our proof controls the sufficient decrease of the functionvalue over the total iterations rather than each iteration as used in theprevious studies, which can be of independent interest in other contexts.

Mode-matching metasurfaces: coherent reconstruction and multiplexing of  surface waves

  Metasurfaces are promising two-dimensional metamaterials that are engineeredto provide unique properties or functionalities absent in naturally occurringhomogeneous surfaces. Here, we report a type of metasurface for tailoredreconstruction of surface plasmon waves from light. The design is generic in away that one can selectively generate different surface plasmon waves throughsimple variation of the wavelength or the polarization state of incident light.The ultra-thin metasurface demonstrated in this paper provides a versatileinterface between the conventional free-space optics and a two-dimensionalplatform such as surface plasmonics.

Density of monochromatic infinite paths

  For any subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we define its upper density to be$\limsup_{ n \rightarrow \infty } |A \cap \{ 1, \dotsc, n \}| / n$. We provethat every $2$-edge-colouring of the complete graph on $\mathbb{N}$ contains amonochromatic infinite path, whose vertex set has upper density at least $(9 +\sqrt{17})/16 \approx 0.82019$. This improves on results of Erd\H{o}s andGalvin, and of DeBiasio and McKenney.

Rainbow matchings in properly-colored hypergraphs

  A hypergraph $H$ is properly colored if for every vertex $v\in V(H)$, all theedges incident to $v$ have distinct colors. In this paper, we show that if$H_{1}$, \cdots, $H_{s}$ are properly-colored $k$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$vertices, where $n\geq3k^{2}s$, and $e(H_{i})>{{n}\choose {k}}-{{n-s+1}\choose{k}}$, then there exists a rainbow matching of size $s$, containing one edgefrom each $H_i$. This generalizes some previous results on the Erd\H{o}sMatching Conjecture.

Interfacial bound exciton state in a hybrid structure of monolayer WS2  and InGaN quantum dots

  Van der Waals heterostructures usually formed using atomic thin transitionmetal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a direct bandgap in the near-infrared to thevisible range are promising candidates for low-dimensional optoelectronicapplications. The interlayer interaction or coupling between two-dimensional(2D) layer and the substrate or between adjacent 2D layers plays an importantrole in modifying properties of the individual 2D material or deviceperformances through Coulomb interaction or forming interlayer excitons. Here,we report the realization of quasi zero-dimensional (0D) photon emission of WS2in a coupled hybrid structure of monolayer WS2 and InGaN quantum dots (QDs). Aninterfacial bound exciton, i.e., coupling between excitons in WS2 and theelectrons in QDs has been identified. The emission of this interfacial boundexciton inherits the 0-D confinement of QDs as well as the spin-valley physicsof excitons in monolayer WS2. The effective coupling between 2D materials andconventional semiconductors observed in this work provides an effective way torealize 0D emission of 2D materials and opens the potential of compact on-chipintegration of valleytronics and conventional electronics/optoelectronics.

Long properly colored cycles in edge colored complete graphs

  Let $K_{n}^{c}$ denote a complete graph on $n$ vertices whose edges arecolored in an arbitrary way. Let $\Delta^{\mathrm{mon}} (K_{n}^{c})$ denote themaximum number of edges of the same color incident with a vertex of$K_{n}^{c}$. A properly colored cycle (path) in $K_{n}^{c}$ is a cycle (path)in which adjacent edges have distinct colors. B. Bollob\'{a}s and P. Erd\"{o}s(1976) proposed the following conjecture: if $\Delta^{\mathrm{mon}}(K_{n}^{c})<\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$, then $K_{n}^{c}$ contains a properlycolored Hamiltonian cycle. Li, Wang and Zhou proved that if$\Delta^{\mathrm{mon}} (K_{n}^{c})< \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$, then$K_{n}^{c}$ contains a properly colored cycle of length at least $\lceil\frac{n+2}{3}\rceil+1$. In this paper, we improve the bound to $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil + 2$.

Tracking Completion

  A fundamental component of modern trackers is an online learned trackingmodel, which is typically modeled either globally or locally. The two kinds ofmodels perform differently in terms of effectiveness and robustness underdifferent challenging situations. This work exploits the advantages of bothmodels. A subspace model, from a global perspective, is learned from previouslyobtained targets via rank-minimization to address the tracking, and apixel-level local observation is leveraged si- multaneously, from a local pointof view, to augment the subspace model. A matrix completion method is employedto integrate the two models. Unlike previous tracking methods, which locate thetarget among all fully observed target candidates, the proposed approach firstestimates an expected target via the matrix completion through partiallyobserved target candidates, and then, identifies the target according to theestimation accuracy with respect to the target candidates. Specifically, thetracking is formulated as a problem of target appearance estimation. Extensiveexperiments on various challenging video sequences verify the effectiveness ofthe proposed approach and demonstrate that the proposed tracker outperformsother popular state-of-the-art trackers.

Real-Time Visual Tracking: Promoting the Robustness of Correlation  Filter Learning

  Correlation filtering based tracking model has received lots of attention andachieved great success in real-time tracking, however, the lost function incurrent correlation filtering paradigm could not reliably response to theappearance changes caused by occlusion and illumination variations. This studyintends to promote the robustness of the correlation filter learning. Byexploiting the anisotropy of the filter response, three sparsity related lossfunctions are proposed to alleviate the overfitting issue of previous methodsand improve the overall tracking performance. As a result, three real-timetrackers are implemented. Extensive experiments in various challengingsituations demonstrate that the robustness of the learned correlation filterhas been greatly improved via the designed loss functions. In addition, thestudy reveals, from an experimental perspective, how different loss functionsessentially influence the tracking performance. An important conclusion is thatthe sensitivity of the peak values of the filter in successive frames isconsistent with the tracking performance. This is a useful reference criterionin designing a robust correlation filter for visual tracking.

Robust Structure from Motion in the Presence of Outliers and Missing  Data

  Structure from motion is an import theme in computer vision. Although greatprogress has been made both in theory and applications, most of the algorithmsonly work for static scenes and rigid objects. In recent years, structure andmotion recovery of non-rigid objects and dynamic scenes have received a lot ofattention. In this paper, the state-of-the-art techniques for structure andmotion factorization of non-rigid objects are reviewed and discussed. First, anintroduction of the structure from motion problem is presented, followed by ageneral formulation of non-rigid structure from motion. Second, an augmentedaffined factorization framework, by using homogeneous representation, ispresented to solve the registration issue in the presence of outlying andmissing data. Third, based on the observation that the reprojection residualsof outliers are significantly larger than those of inliers, a robustfactorization strategy with outlier rejection is proposed by means of thereprojection residuals, followed by some comparative experimental evaluations.Finally, some future research topics in non-rigid structure from motion arediscussed.

Stochastic Variance-Reduced Cubic Regularization for Nonconvex  Optimization

  Cubic regularization (CR) is an optimization method with emerging popularitydue to its capability to escape saddle points and converge to second-orderstationary solutions for nonconvex optimization. However, CR encounters a highsample complexity issue for finite-sum problems with a large data size.%Various inexact variants of CR have been proposed to improve the samplecomplexity. In this paper, we propose a stochastic variance-reducedcubic-regularization (SVRC) method under random sampling, and study itsconvergence guarantee as well as sample complexity. We show that the iterationcomplexity of SVRC for achieving a second-order stationary solution within$\epsilon$ accuracy is $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, which matches the state-of-artresult on CR types of methods. Moreover, our proposed variance reduction schemesignificantly reduces the per-iteration sample complexity. The resulting totalHessian sample complexity of our SVRC is ${\Oc}(N^{2/3} \epsilon^{-3/2})$,which outperforms the state-of-art result by a factor of $O(N^{2/15})$. We alsostudy our SVRC under random sampling without replacement scheme, which yields alower per-iteration sample complexity, and hence justifies its practicalapplicability.

An Efficient Approach for Polyps Detection in Endoscopic Videos Based on  Faster R-CNN

  Polyp has long been considered as one of the major etiologies to colorectalcancer which is a fatal disease around the world, thus early detection andrecognition of polyps plays a crucial role in clinical routines. Accuratediagnoses of polyps through endoscopes operated by physicians becomes achallenging task not only due to the varying expertise of physicians, but alsothe inherent nature of endoscopic inspections. To facilitate this process,computer-aid techniques that emphasize fully-conventional image processing andnovel machine learning enhanced approaches have been dedicatedly designed forpolyp detection in endoscopic videos or images. Among all proposed algorithms,deep learning based methods take the lead in terms of multiple metrics inevolutions for algorithmic performance. In this work, a highly effective model,namely the faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) isimplemented for polyp detection. In comparison with the reported results of thestate-of-the-art approaches on polyps detection, extensive experimentsdemonstrate that the Faster R-CNN achieves very competing results, and it is anefficient approach for clinical practice.

MDCN: Multi-Scale, Deep Inception Convolutional Neural Networks for  Efficient Object Detection

  Object detection in challenging situations such as scale variation,occlusion, and truncation depends not only on feature details but also oncontextual information. Most previous networks emphasize too much on detailedfeature extraction through deeper and wider networks, which may enhance theaccuracy of object detection to certain extent. However, the feature detailsare easily being changed or washed out after passing through complicatedfiltering structures. To better handle these challenges, the paper proposes anovel framework, multi-scale, deep inception convolutional neural network(MDCN), which focuses on wider and broader object regions by activating featuremaps produced in the deep part of the network. Instead of incepting innerlayers in the shallow part of the network, multi-scale inceptions areintroduced in the deep layers. The proposed framework integrates the contextualinformation into the learning process through a single-shot network structure.It is computational efficient and avoids the hard training problem of previousmacro feature extraction network designed for shallow layers. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of MDCN overthe state-of-the-art models.

Cubic Regularization with Momentum for Nonconvex Optimization

  Momentum is a popular technique to accelerate the convergence in practicaltraining, and its impact on convergence guarantee has been well-studied forfirst-order algorithms. However, such a successful acceleration technique hasnot yet been proposed for second-order algorithms in nonconvex optimization.Inthis paper, we apply the momentum scheme to cubic regularized (CR) Newton'smethod and explore the potential for acceleration. Our numerical experiments onvarious nonconvex optimization problems demonstrate that the momentum schemecan substantially facilitate the convergence of cubic regularization, andperform even better than the Nesterov's acceleration scheme for CR.Theoretically, we prove that CR under momentum achieves the best possibleconvergence rate to a second-order stationary point for nonconvex optimization.Moreover, we study the proposed algorithm for solving problems satisfying anerror bound condition and establish a local quadratic convergence rate. Then,particularly for finite-sum problems, we show that the proposed algorithm canallow computational inexactness that reduces the overall sample complexitywithout degrading the convergence rate.

Natural Scene Recognition Based on Superpixels and Deep Boltzmann  Machines

  The Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) is a state-of-the-art unsupervised learningmodel, which has been successfully applied to handwritten digit recognitionand, as well as object recognition. However, the DBM is limited in scenerecognition due to the fact that natural scene images are usually very large.In this paper, an efficient scene recognition approach is proposed based onsuperpixels and the DBMs. First, a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC)algorithm is employed to generate superpixels of input images, where eachsuperpixel is regarded as an input of a learning model. Then, a two-layer DBMmodel is constructed by stacking two restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), anda greedy layer-wise algorithm is applied to train the DBM model. Finally, asoftmax regression is utilized to categorize scene images. The proposedtechnique can effectively reduce the computational complexity and enhance theperformance for large natural image recognition. The approach is verified andevaluated by extensive experiments, including the fifteen-scene categoriesdataset the UIUC eight-sports dataset, and the SIFT flow dataset, are used toevaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposedapproach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognitionrate.

Vision-based Real-Time Aerial Object Localization and Tracking for UAV  Sensing System

  The paper focuses on the problem of vision-based obstacle detection andtracking for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation. A real-time objectlocalization and tracking strategy from monocular image sequences is developedby effectively integrating the object detection and tracking into a dynamicKalman model. At the detection stage, the object of interest is automaticallydetected and localized from a saliency map computed via the image backgroundconnectivity cue at each frame; at the tracking stage, a Kalman filter isemployed to provide a coarse prediction of the object state, which is furtherrefined via a local detector incorporating the saliency map and the temporalinformation between two consecutive frames. Compared to existing methods, theproposed approach does not require any manual initialization for tracking, runsmuch faster than the state-of-the-art trackers of its kind, and achievescompetitive tracking performance on a large number of image sequences.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance ofthe proposed approach.

BPGrad: Towards Global Optimality in Deep Learning via Branch and  Pruning

  Understanding the global optimality in deep learning (DL) has been attractingmore and more attention recently. Conventional DL solvers, however, have notbeen developed intentionally to seek for such global optimality. In this paperwe propose a novel approximation algorithm, BPGrad, towards optimizing deepmodels globally via branch and pruning. Our BPGrad algorithm is based on theassumption of Lipschitz continuity in DL, and as a result it can adaptivelydetermine the step size for current gradient given the history of previousupdates, wherein theoretically no smaller steps can achieve the globaloptimality. We prove that, by repeating such branch-and-pruning procedure, wecan locate the global optimality within finite iterations. Empirically anefficient solver based on BPGrad for DL is proposed as well, and it outperformsconventional DL solvers such as Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSProp, and Adam in thetasks of object recognition, detection, and segmentation.

Strong list-chromatic index of subcubic graphs

  A strong $k$-edge-coloring of a graph G is an edge-coloring with $k$ colorsin which every color class is an induced matching. The strong chromatic indexof $G$, denoted by $\chi'_{s}(G)$, is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ has astrong $k$-edge-coloring. In 1985, Erd\H{o}s and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il conjecturedthat $\chi'_{s}(G)\leq\frac{5}{4}\Delta(G)^2$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximumdegree of $G$. When $G$ is a graph with maximum degree at most 3, theconjecture was verified independently by Andersen and Hor\'{a}k, Qing, andTrotter. In this paper, we consider the list version of strong edge-coloring.In particular, we show that every subcubic graph has strong list-chromaticindex at most 11 and every planar subcubic graph has strong list-chromaticindex at most 10.

Optically Reconfigurable Photonic Devices

  Optoelectronic components with adjustable parameters, fromvariable-focal-length lenses to spectral filters that can change functionalityupon stimulation, have enormous technological importance. Tuning of suchcomponents is conventionally achieved by either micro- or nano-mechanicalactuation of their consitutive parts, stretching or application of thermalstimuli. Here we report a new dielectric metasurface platform forreconfigurable optical components that are created with light in a non-volatileand reversible fashion. Such components are written, erased and re-written astwo-dimensional binary or grey-scale patterns into a nanoscale film of phasechange material by inducing a refractive-index-changing phase-transition withtailored trains of femtosecond pulses. We combinegermanium-antimony-tellurium-based films optimized for high-optical-contrastovonic switching with a sub-wavelength-resolution optical writing process todemonstrate technologically relevant devices: visible-range reconfigurablebi-chromatic and multi-focus Fresnel zone-plates, a super-oscillatory lens withsub-wavelength focus, a grey-scale hologram and a dielectric metamaterial withon-demand reflcetion and transmission resonances.

First Integrated Implosion Experiment of Three-Axis Cylindrical Hohlraum  at the SGIII Laser Facility

  The first integrated implosion experiment of three-axis cylindrical hohlraum(TACH) was accomplished at the SGIII laser facility. 24 laser beams of theSGIII laser facility were carefully chosen and quasi-symmetrically injectedinto the TACH, in which a highly symmetric radiation filed was generated with apeak radiation temperature of ~190eV. Driven by the radiation field, theneutron yield of a deuterium gas filled capsule reached ~1e9, and thecorresponding yield over clean (YOC) was ~40% for a convergence ratio (Cr) of~17. The X-ray self-emission image of imploded capsule cores was nearly round,and the backscatter fraction of laser beams was less than 1.25%. Thisexperiment preliminarily demonstrated the major performance of TACH, such asthe robustness of symmetry, and a laser plasma instability (LPI) behaviorsimilar to that of the outer ring of traditional cylindrical hohlraum.

First Investigation on the Radiation Field of the Gas-Filled Three-Axis  Cylindrical Hohlraum

  A novel ignition hohlraum named three-axis cylindrical hohlraum (TACH) isdesigned for indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion. TACH is a kind of 6laser entrance holes (LEHs) hohlraum, which is orthogonally jointed of threecylindrical hohlraums. The first experiment on the radiation field of TACH wasperformed on Shenguang III laser facility. 24 laser beams were elected andinjected into 6 LEHs quasi-symmetrically. Total laser energy was about 59 kJ,and the peak radiation temperature reached about 192 eV. Radiation temperatureand pinhole images in gas-filled hohlraum are largely identical but with minordifferences with those in vacuum hohlraum. All laser energy can be totallydelivered into hohlraum in 3 ns duration even without filled gas in thehohlraum of 1.4 mm diameter. Plasma filling cannot be obviously suppressed evenwith 0.5 atm pressure gas in the small hohlraum. Backscattering fractions ofvacuum hohlraum and gas-filled hohlraum are both lower than 2%. Experimentalstudy of this new kind of hohlraum can provide guidance for future targetdesign and implosion experiment.

List version of ($p$,1)-total labellings

  The ($p$,1)-total number $\lambda_p^T(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the width of thesmallest range of integers that suffices to label the vertices and the edges of$G$ such that no two adjacent vertices have the same label, no two incidentedges have the same label and the difference between the labels of a vertex andits incident edges is at least $p$. In this paper we consider the list version.Let $L(x)$ be a list of possible colors for all $x\in V(G)\cup E(G)$. Define$C_{p,1}^T(G)$ to be the smallest integer $k$ such that for every listassignment with $|L(x)|=k$ for all $x\in V(G)\cup E(G)$, $G$ has a($p$,1)-total labelling $c$ such that $c(x)\in L(x)$ for all $x\in V(G)\cupE(G)$. We call $C_{p,1}^T(G)$ the ($p$,1)-total labelling choosability and $G$is list $L$-($p$,1)-total labelable. In this paper, we present a conjecture onthe upper bound of $C_{p,1}^T$. Furthermore, we study this parameter for pathsand trees in Section 2. We also prove that $C_{p,1}^T(K_{1,n})\leq n+2p-1$ forstar $K_{1,n}$ with $p\geq2, n\geq3$ in Section 3 and $C_{p,1}^T(G)\leq\Delta+2p-1$ for outerplanar graph with $\Delta\geq p+3$ in Section 4.

High-T_c superconductivity in ultrathin Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8+x down to  halfunit-cell thickness by protection with graphene

  High-T_c superconductors confined to two dimension exhibit novel physicalphenomena, such as superconductor-insulator transition. In theBi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8+x (Bi2212) model system, despite extensive studies, theintrinsic superconducting properties at the thinness limit have been difficultto determine. Here we report a method to fabricate high quality single-crystalBi2212 films down to half-unit-cell thickness in the form of graphene/Bi2212van der Waals heterostructure, in which sharp superconducting transitions areobserved. The heterostructure also exhibits a nonlinear current-voltagecharacteristic due to the Dirac nature of the graphene band structure. Moreinterestingly, although the critical temperature remains essentially the samewith reduced thickness of Bi2212, the slope of the normal state T-linearresistivity varies by a factor of 4-5, and the sheet resistance increases bythree orders of magnitude, indicating a surprising decoupling of the normalstate resistance and superconductivity. The developed technique is versatile,applicable to investigate other two-dimensional (2D) superconducting materials.

A Novel Feature Extraction Method for Scene Recognition Based on  Centered Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines

  Scene recognition is an important research topic in computer vision, whilefeature extraction is a key step of object recognition. Although classicalRestricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) can efficiently represent complicated data,it is hard to handle large images due to its complexity in computation. In thispaper, a novel feature extraction method, named Centered ConvolutionalRestricted Boltzmann Machines (CCRBM), is proposed for scene recognition. Theproposed model is an improved Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines(CRBM) by introducing centered factors in its learning strategy to reduce thesource of instabilities. First, the visible units of the network are redefinedusing centered factors. Then, the hidden units are learned with a modifiedenergy function by utilizing a distribution function, and the visible units arereconstructed using the learned hidden units. In order to achieve bettergenerative ability, the Centered Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (CCDBN) istrained in a greedy layer-wise way. Finally, a softmax regression isincorporated for scene recognition. Extensive experimental evaluations usingnatural scenes, MIT-indoor scenes, and Caltech 101 datasets show that theproposed approach performs better than other counterparts in terms ofstability, generalization, and discrimination. The CCDBN model is more suitablefor natural scene image recognition by virtue of convolutional property.

Learning Depth from Single Images with Deep Neural Network Embedding  Focal Length

  Learning depth from a single image, as an important issue in sceneunderstanding, has attracted a lot of attention in the past decade. Theaccuracy of the depth estimation has been improved from conditional Markovrandom fields, non-parametric methods, to deep convolutional neural networksmost recently. However, there exist inherent ambiguities in recovering 3D froma single 2D image. In this paper, we first prove the ambiguity between thefocal length and monocular depth learning, and verify the result usingexperiments, showing that the focal length has a great influence on accuratedepth recovery. In order to learn monocular depth by embedding the focallength, we propose a method to generate synthetic varying-focal-length datasetfrom fixed-focal-length datasets, and a simple and effective method isimplemented to fill the holes in the newly generated images. For the sake ofaccurate depth recovery, we propose a novel deep neural network to infer depththrough effectively fusing the middle-level information on thefixed-focal-length dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methodsbuilt on pre-trained VGG. Furthermore, the newly generated varying-focal-lengthdataset is taken as input to the proposed network in both learning andinference phases. Extensive experiments on the fixed- and varying-focal-lengthdatasets demonstrate that the learned monocular depth with embedded focallength is significantly improved compared to that without embedding the focallength information.

Adversarially Approximated Autoencoder for Image Generation and  Manipulation

  Regularized autoencoders learn the latent codes, a structure with theregularization under the distribution, which enables them the capability toinfer the latent codes given observations and generate new samples given thecodes. However, they are sometimes ambiguous as they tend to producereconstructions that are not necessarily faithful reproduction of the inputs.The main reason is to enforce the learned latent code distribution to match aprior distribution while the true distribution remains unknown. To improve thereconstruction quality and learn the latent space a manifold structure, thiswork present a novel approach using the adversarially approximated autoencoder(AAAE) to investigate the latent codes with adversarial approximation. Insteadof regularizing the latent codes by penalizing on the distance between thedistributions of the model and the target, AAAE learns the autoencoder flexiblyand approximates the latent space with a simpler generator. The ratio isestimated using generative adversarial network (GAN) to enforce the similarityof the distributions. Additionally, the image space is regularized with anadditional adversarial regularizer. The proposed approach unifies two deepgenerative models for both latent space inference and diverse generation. Thelearning scheme is realized without regularization on the latent codes, whichalso encourages faithful reconstruction. Extensive validation experiments onfour real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AAAE. Incomparison to the state-of-the-art approaches, AAAE generates samples withbetter quality and shares the properties of regularized autoencoder with a nicelatent manifold structure.
