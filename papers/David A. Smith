Viscous propulsion in active transversely-isotropic media: Corrigendum

  We report a corrigendum to the paper 'Viscous propulsion in active
transversely-isotropic media' [J. Fluid Mech. 812, 501-524, 2017 / arxiv
1608.01451].


Smith Ideals of Operadic Algebras in Monoidal Model Categories

  Building upon Hovey's work on Smith ideals for monoids, we develop a homotopy
theory of Smith ideals for general operads in a symmetric monoidal category.
For a sufficiently nice stable monoidal model category and an operad satisfying
a cofibrancy condition, we show that there is a Quillen equivalence between a
model structure on Smith ideals and a model structure on algebra maps induced
by the cokernel and the kernel. For symmetric spectra this applies to the
commutative operad and all Sigma-cofibrant operads. For chain complexes over a
field of characteristic zero and the stable module category, this Quillen
equivalence holds for all operads.


Smith theory and geometric Hecke algebras

  In 1960 Borel proved a "localization" result relating the rational cohomology
of a topological space X to the rational cohomology of the fixed points for a
torus action on X. This result and its generalizations have many applications
in Lie theory. In 1934, P. Smith proved a similar localization result relating
the mod p cohomology of X to the mod p cohomology of the fixed points for a
Z/p-action on X. In this paper we study Z/p-localization ("Smith theory") for
constructible sheaves and functions. We show that Smith theory on loop groups
is related via the geometric Satake correspondence to some special
homomorphisms that exist between algebraic groups defined over a field of small
characteristic.


On tilting modules over cluster-tilted algebras

  In this paper, we show that the tilting modules over a cluster-tilted algebra
$A$ lift to tilting objects in the associated cluster category $\mathcal{C}_H$.
As a first application, we describe the induced exchange relation for tilting
$A$-modules arising from the exchange relation for tilting object in
$\mathcal{C}_H$. As a second application, we exhibit tilting $A$-modules having
cluster-tilted endomorphism algebras.


Jordan and Smith forms of Pascal-related matrices

  We present matrix identities which yield respectively the Jordan canonical
form of the Pascal matrix P_n = (i -1 choose j -1)_{1 <= i,j <= n} modulo a
prime, the eigenvectors of (i choose j)_{1 <= i,j <= n}, and the Smith normal
form of powers of P_n - I_n.


Functoriality, Smith theory, and the Brauer homomorphism

  If $\sigma$ is an automorphism of order $p$ of the semisimple group
$\mathbf{G}$, there is a natural correspondence between mod $p$ cohomological
automorphic forms on $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{G}^\sigma$. We describe this
correspondence in the global and local settings.


Filtering subcategories of modules of an artinian algebra

  Let $A$ be an artinian algebra, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a subcategory of
mod$A$ that is closed under extensions. When $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under
kernels of epimorphisms (or closed under cokernels of monomorphisms), we
describe the smallest class of modules that filters $\mathcal{C}$. As a
consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for the finitistic dimension of an
algebra over a field to be finite. We also apply our results to the torsion
pairs. In particular, when a torsion pair is induced by a tilting module, we
show that the smallest classes of modules that filter the torsion and
torsion-free classes are completely compatible with the quasi-equivalences of
Brenner and Butler.


Well-posed two-point initial-boundary value problems with arbitrary
  boundary conditions

  We study initial-boundary value problems for linear evolution equations of
arbitrary spatial order, subject to arbitrary linear boundary conditions and
posed on a rectangular 1-space, 1-time domain. We give a new characterisation
of the boundary conditions that specify well-posed problems using Fokas'
transform method. We also give a sufficient condition guaranteeing that the
solution can be represented using a series.
  The relevant condition, the analyticity at infinity of certain meromorphic
functions within particular sectors, is significantly more concrete and easier
to test than the previous criterion, based on the existence of admissible
functions.


Skew group algebras of piecewise hereditary algebras are piecewise
  hereditary

  We show that the main results of Happel-Rickard-Schofield (1988) and
Happel-Reiten-Smalo (1996) on piecewise hereditary algebras are coherent with
the notion of group action on an algebra. Then, we take advantage of this
compatibility and show that if G is a finite group acting on a piecewise
hereditary algebra A over an algebraically closed field whose characteristic
does not divide the order of G, then the resulting skew group algebra A[G] is
also piecewise hereditary.


Friezes, Strings and Cluster Variables

  To any walk in a quiver, we associate a Laurent polynomial. When the walk is
the string of a string module over a 2-Calabi-Yau tilted algebra, we prove that
this Laurent polynomial coincides with the corresponding cluster character of
the string module, up to an explicit normalising monomial factor.


Well-posedness and conditioning of 3rd and higher order two-point
  initial-boundary value problems

  We discuss initial-boundary value problems of arbitrary spatial order subject
to arbitrary boundary conditions. We formalise the concept of the conditioning
of such a problem and show that it represents a necessary criterion for
well-posedness. The other requirement for well-posedness, the convergence of
certain series, is also analysed. We illustrate these results with a full
classification of 3rd order problems having non-Robin boundary conditions.
  Part of this work is devoted to correcting an oversight in the author's
earlier work Well-posed two-point initial-boundary value problems with
arbitrary boundary conditions in volume 152 of Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc.


First-fit coloring on interval graphs has performance ratio at least 5

  First-fit is the online graph coloring algorithm that considers vertices one
at a time in some order and assigns each vertex the least positive integer not
used already on a neighbor. The maximum number of colors used by first-fit on
graph G over all vertex orders is denoted \chi_{FF}(G).
  The exact value of R := \sup_G [\chi_{FF}(G) / \omega(G)] over interval
graphs G is unknown. Pemmaraju, Raman, and Varadarajan (2004) proved R <= 10,
and this can be improved to 8. Witsenhausen (1976) and Chrobak and \'Slusarek
(1988) showed R >= 4, and \'Slusarek (1993) improved this to 4.45. We prove R
>= 5.


Review of the Solar Array Telescopes

  For several years the only experiments sensitive to astrophysical gamma rays
with energies beyond the reach of EGRET but below that of the Cherenkov imaging
telescopes have been the "solar tower" detectors. They use >2000 m2 mirror
areas to sample the Cherenkov wavefront generated by <100 GeV gamma rays,
obtaining Crab sensitivities of more than 6$\sigma$ in one ON-source hour. I
will review the history of the solar tower Cherenkov experiments from 1992 to
the present and their key design features. I will describe some successful
analysis strategies, then summarize the principal results obtained.


Infinite friezes and triangulations of the strip

  The infinite friezes of positive integers were introduced by Tschabold as a
variation of the classical Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns. These infinite
friezes were further shown be to realizable via triangulations of the infinite
strip by Baur, Parsons and Tschabold. In this paper, we show that the
construction of Baur, Parsons and Tschabold can be slightly adapted in order to
obtain a bijection between the infinite friezes and the so-called admissible
triangulations of the infinite strip with no special marked points on the upper
boundary. As a consequence, we obtain that the infinite friezes with enough
ones are in bijection with the admissible triangulations of the infinity-gon.


Calibrations and Fayyazuddin-Smith Spacetimes

  We show that a class of spacetimes introduced by Fayyazuddin and Smith to
describe intersecting M5-branes admit a generalized Kahler calibration.
Equipped with this understanding, we are able to construct spacetimes
corresponding to further classes of calibrated $p$-brane world-volume solitons.
We note that these classes of spacetimes also describe the fields of $p$-branes
wrapping certain supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds.


Measuring and manipulating the temperature of cold molecules trapped on
  a chip

  We demonstrate the measurement and manipulation of the temperature of cold CO
molecules in a microchip environment. Through the use of time-resolved spatial
imaging, we are able to observe the phase-space distribution of the molecules,
and hence deduce the corresponding temperature. We do this both by observing
the expansion of the molecular ensemble in time and through the use of
numerical trajectory simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the adiabatic
cooling of the trapped molecular sample and discuss this process.


The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager observation of
  the 1809 keV line from Galactic 26Al

  Observations of the central radian of the Galaxy by the Reuven Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopy Imager (RHESSI) have yielded a high-resolution
measurement of the 1809 keV line from 26Al, detected at 11 sigma significance
in nine months of data. The RHESSI result for the width of the cosmic line is
2.03 (+0.78, -1.21) keV FWHM. The best fit line width of 5.4 keV FWHM reported
by Naya et al. (1996) using the Gamma-Ray Imaging Spectrometer (GRIS) balloon
instrument is rejected with high confidence.


Approximations of injective modules and finitistic dimension

  Let $\Lambda$ be an artin algebra and let $\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$ the
category of finitely generated right $\Lambda$-modules of finite projective
dimension. We show that $\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$ is contravariantly
finite in $\rm mod\,\Lambda$ if and only if the direct sum $E$ of the
indecomposable Ext-injective modules in $\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$ form a
tilting module in $\rm mod\,\Lambda$. Moreover, we show that in this case $E$
coincides with the direct sum of the minimal right
$\mathcal{P}^{<\infty}_\Lambda$-approximations of the indecomposable
$\Lambda$-injective modules and that the projective dimension of $E$ equal to
the finitistic dimension of $\Lambda$.


A Search For Star Formation in the Smith Cloud

  Motivated by the idea that a subset of HVCs trace dark matter substructure in
the Local Group, we search for signs of star formation in the Smith Cloud, a
nearby ~2x10^6 Msun HVC currently falling into the Milky Way. Using GALEX NUV
and WISE/2MASS NIR photometry, we apply a series of color and apparent
magnitude cuts to isolate candidate O and B stars that are plausibly associated
with the Smith Cloud. We find an excess of stars along the line of sight to the
cloud, but not at a statistically significant level relative to a control
region. The number of stars found in projection on the cloud after removing an
estimate of the contamination by the Milky Way implies an average star
formation rate surface density of 10^(-4.8 +/- 0.3) Msun yr^(-1) kpc^(-2),
assuming the cloud has been forming stars at a constant rate since its first
passage through the Milky Way ~70 Myr ago. This value is consistent with the
star formation rate expected based on the average gas density of the cloud. We
also discuss how the newly discovered star forming galaxy Leo P has very
similar properties to the Smith Cloud, but its young stellar population would
not have been detected at a statistically significant level using our method.
Thus, we cannot yet rule out the idea that the Smith Cloud is really a dwarf
galaxy.


Hard X-ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors

  The detection of photons above 10 keV through MeV and GeV energies is
challenging due to the penetrating nature of the radiation, which can require
large detector volumes, resulting in correspondingly high background. In this
energy range, most detectors in space are either scintillators or solid-state
detectors. The choice of detector technology depends on the energy range of
interest, expected levels of signal and background, required energy and spatial
resolution, particle environment on orbit, and other factors. This section
covers the materials and configurations commonly used from 10 keV to > 1 GeV.


Almost laura algebras

  In this paper, we propose a generalization for the class of laura algebras,
which we call almost laura. We show that this new class of algebras retains
most of the essential features of laura algebras, especially concerning the
important role played by the non-semiregular components in their
Auslander-Reiten quivers. Also, we study more intensively the left supported
almost laura algebras, showing that these are characterized by the presence of
a generalized standard, convex and faithful component. Finally, we prove that
almost laura algebras behave well with respect to full subcategories,
split-by-nilpotent extensions and skew group algebras.


Risks due to X-ray Flares during Astronaut Extravehicular Activity

  Solar hard X-ray flares can expose astronauts on lunar and deep space
extravehicular activities (EVAs) to dangerous acute biological doses. We
combine calculations of radiative transfer through shielding materials with
subsequent transfer through tissue to show that hazardous doses, taken as >=
0.1 Gy, should occur with a probability of about 10% per 100 hours of
accumulated EVA inside current spacesuits. The rapid onset and short duration
of X-ray flares and the lack of viable precursor events require strategies for
quick retreat, in contrast to solar proton events, which usually take hours to
deliver significant fluence and can often be anticipated by flares or other
light-speed precursors. Our results contrast with the view that only particle
radiation poses dangers for human space exploration. Heavy-element shields
provide the most efficient protection from X-ray flares, since X-rays produce
no significant secondary radiation. We calculate doses due to X-ray flares
behind aluminum shields and estimate the required shield masses to accompany
EVA rovers.


Heat equation on a network using the Fokas method

  The problem of heat conduction on networks of multiply connected rods is
solved by providing an explicit solution of the one-dimensional heat equation
in each domain. The size and connectivity of the rods is known, but neither
temperature nor heat flux are prescribed at the interface. Instead, the
physical assumptions of continuity at the interfaces are the only conditions
imposed. This work generalizes that of Deconinck, Pelloni, and Sheils, 2014,
for heat conduction on a series of one-dimensional rods connected end-to-end to
the case of general configurations.


Astrophysics with HESSI

  In the summer of the year 2000, a NASA Small Explorer satellite, the High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (HESSI), will be launched. It will consist of
nine large, coaxial germanium detectors viewing the Sun through a set of
Rotation Modulation Collimators and will accomplish high-resolution imaging and
spectroscopy of solar flares in the x-ray and gamma-ray bands. Here we describe
some of the astrophysical observations HESSI will also perform in addition to
its solar mission.


Spectropolarimetry and the Geometry of Type 1 Seyfert Nuclei

  We describe the results of a detailed study of the polarization properties of
the broad H-alpha emission line in Type 1 Seyfert nuclei. Our analysis of these
data points to a model in which the broad Balmer lines are emitted by a
rotating disk, and are scattered in two main regions - one co-planar with the
disk and within the circum-nuclear torus, the other, the polar scattering
region, outside the torus but aligned with its axis. The relative importance of
the two sources of polarized light is largely determined by the inclination of
the system axis to the line-of-sight.


The Smith and critical groups of Paley graphs

  There is a Paley graph for each prime power $q$ such that $q\equiv 1\pmod 4$.
The vertex set is the field $\mathbb Fq$ and two vertices $x$ and $y$ are
joined by an edge if and only if $x-y$ is a nonzero square of $\mathbb Fq$. We
compute the Smith normal forms of the adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix of
a Paley graph.


Counting Points on Genus 2 Curves with Real Multiplication

  We present an accelerated Schoof-type point-counting algorithm for curves of
genus 2 equipped with an efficiently computable real multiplication
endomorphism. Our new algorithm reduces the complexity of genus 2 point
counting over a finite field (\F_{q}) of large characteristic from
(\widetilde{O}(\log^8 q)) to (\widetilde{O}(\log^5 q)). Using our algorithm we
compute a 256-bit prime-order Jacobian, suitable for cryptographic
applications, and also the order of a 1024-bit Jacobian.


Comonad Cohomology of Track Categories

  We define a comonad cohomology of track categories and we show it is linked
by a long exact sequence to its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology . Under mild
hypothesis on the track category, we show that its comonad cohomology
coincides, up to dimension shift, with its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology,
therefore obtaining an algebraic formulation of the latter. We also specialize
our results to the case where the track category is a $2$-groupoid.


Bose-Einstein condensation as symmetry breaking in compact curved
  spacetimes

  We examine Bose-Einstein condensation as a form of symmetry breaking in the
specific model of the Einstein static universe. We show that symmetry breaking
never occursin the sense that the chemical potential $\mu$ never reaches its
critical value.This leads us to some statements about spaces of finite volume
in general. In an appendix we clarify the relationship between the standard
statistical mechanical approaches and the field theory method using zeta
functions.


Hysteresis of spectral evolution in the soft state of black-hole binary
  LMC X-3

  We report the discovery of hysteresis between the x-ray spectrum and
luminosity of black-hole binary LMC X-3. Our observations, with the
Proportional Counter Array on the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, took place
entirely within the soft spectral state, dominated by a spectral component that
was fitted well with a multicolor disk blackbody. A power-law component was
seen only during times when the luminosity of the disk blackbody was declining.
The x-ray luminosity at these times was comparable to that seen in transient
systems (x-ray novae) when they return to the hard state at the end of an
outburst. Our observations may represent partial transitions to the hard state;
complete transitions have been seen in this system by Wilms et al. (2001). If
they are related to the soft-to-hard transition in transients, then they
demonstrate that hysteresis effects can appear without a full state transition.
We discuss these observations in the context of earlier observations of
hysteresis within the hard state of binaries 1E 1740.7-2942 and GRS 1758-258
and in relation to published explanations of hysteresis in transients.


On the influence of radio galaxies on cooling flows: M87 and Cygnus A

  Results from Chandra studies of the intracluster medium around M87 and Cygnus
A are summarized.


Stability Conditions and Maximal Green Sequences in Abelian Categories

  In this paper we study the stability functions on abelian categories
introduced by Rudakov in \cite{Ru} and their relation with torsion classes and
maximal green sequences. Moreover we introduce a new kind of stability function
using the wall and chamber structure of the category.


New Alignment Methods for Discriminative Book Summarization

  We consider the unsupervised alignment of the full text of a book with a
human-written summary. This presents challenges not seen in other text
alignment problems, including a disparity in length and, consequent to this, a
violation of the expectation that individual words and phrases should align,
since large passages and chapters can be distilled into a single summary
phrase. We present two new methods, based on hidden Markov models, specifically
targeted to this problem, and demonstrate gains on an extractive book
summarization task. While there is still much room for improvement,
unsupervised alignment holds intrinsic value in offering insight into what
features of a book are deemed worthy of summarization.


Comparing cohomology obstructions

  We show that three different kinds of cohomology - Baues-Wirsching
cohomology, the (S,O)-cohomology of Dwyer-Kan, and the Andre-Quillen cohomology
of a Pi-algebra - are isomorphic, under certain assumptions.
  This is then used to identify the cohomological obstructions in three general
approaches to realizability problems: the track category version of
Baues-Wirsching, the diagram rectifications of Dwyer-Kan-Smith, and the
Pi-Algebra realization of Dwyer-Kan-Stover. Our main tool in this
identification is the notion of a mapping algebra: a simplicially enriched
version of an algebra over a theory.


Single-Class Genera of Positive Integral Lattices

  We give an enumeration of all positive definite primitive Z-lattices in
dimension >= 3 whose genus consists of a single isometry class. This is
achieved by using bounds obtained from the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula
to computationally construct the square-free determinant lattices with this
property, and then repeatedly calculating pre-images under a mapping first
introduced by G. L. Watson. We hereby complete the classification of
single-class genera in dimensions 4 and 5 and correct some mistakes in Watson's
classifications in other dimensions. A list of all single-class primitive
Z-lattices has been compiled and incorporated into the Catalogue of Lattices.


A new and improved ephemeris for the hot subdwarf eclipsing binary SDSS
  J082053.53+000843.4

  SDSS J082053.53+000843.4 belongs to the HW Vir family of short period binary
systems and was first identified by Geier in 2011. Whilst three subsequent
papers have focused on the morphology of this system, little has been published
on the system period and its constancy. Here we provide the first published
times of minima together with a revised ephemeris and a binary period,
0.0962404(1)d, that is four orders of magnitude more precise than previous
declared values.


IGR J17544-2619 in depth with Suzaku: direct evidence for clumpy winds
  in a supergiant fast X-ray transient

  We present the first direct evidence for dense clumps of matter in the
companion wind in a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) binary. This is seen
as a brief period of enhanced absorption during one of the bright, fast flares
that distinguish these systems. The object under study was IGR J17544-2619, and
a total of 236 ks of data were accumulated with the Japanese satellite Suzaku.
The activity in this period spans a dynamic range of almost 10000 in luminosity
and gives a detailed look at SFXT behavior.


Frises

  Each acyclic graph, and more generally, each acyclic orientation of the graph
associated to a Cartan matrix, allows to define a so-called frise; this is a
collection of sequences over the positive natural numbers, one for each vertex
of the graph. We prove that if these sequences satisfy a linear recurrence,
then the Cartan matrix is of Dynkin type (if the sequences are bounded) or of
Euclidean type (if the sequences are unbounded). We prove the converse in all
cases, except for the exceptional Euclidean Cartan matrices; we show even that
the sequences are rational over the positive natural numbers. We generalize
these results by considering frises with variables; as a byproduct we obtain,
for the Dynkin and Euclidean type A cases, explicit formulas for the cluster
variables, over the semiring of Laurent polynomials over the positive natural
numbers generated by the initial variables (which explains simultaneously
positivity and the Laurent phenomenon). The general tool are the so-called
SL_2-tilings of the plane; these are fillings of the whole discrete plane by
elements of a ring, in such a way that each 2 by 2 connected submatrix is of
determinant 1.


Quantum-Noise-Limited Sensitivity-Enhancement of a Passive Optical
  Cavity by a Fast-Light Medium

  We demonstrate for a passive optical cavity containing a dispersive atomic
medium, the increase in scale factor near the critical anomalous dispersion is
not cancelled by mode broadening or attenuation, resulting in an overall
increase in the predicted quantum-noise-limited sensitivity. Enhancements of
over two orders of magnitude are measured in the scale factor, which translates
to greater than an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the predicted
quantum-noise-limited measurement precision, by temperature tuning a
low-pressure vapor of non-interacting atoms in a low-finesse cavity close to
the critical anomalous dispersion condition. The predicted enhancement in
sensitivity is confirmed through Monte-Carlo numerical simulations.


Charge Pumping in Carbon Nanotubes

  We demonstrate charge pumping in semiconducting carbon nanotubes by a
traveling potential wave. From the observation of pumping in the nanotube
insulating state we deduce that transport occurs by packets of charge being
carried along by the wave. By tuning the potential of a side gate, transport of
either electron or hole packets can be realized. Prospects for the realization
of nanotube based single-electron pumps are discussed.


Spectral theory of some non-selfadjoint linear differential operators

  We give a characterisation of the spectral properties of linear differential
operators with constant coefficients, acting on functions defined on a bounded
interval, and determined by general linear boundary conditions. The boundary
conditions may be such that the resulting operator is not selfadjoint.
  We associate the spectral properties of such an operator $S$ with the
properties of the solution of a corresponding boundary value problem for the
partial differential equation $\partial_t q \pm iSq=0$. Namely, we are able to
establish an explicit correspondence between the properties of the family of
eigenfunctions of the operator, and in particular whether this family is a
basis, and the existence and properties of the unique solution of the
associated boundary value problem. When such a unique solution exists, we
consider its representation as a complex contour integral that is obtained
using a transform method recently proposed by Fokas and one of the authors. The
analyticity properties of the integrand in this representation are crucial for
studying the spectral theory of the associated operator.


The Cantor-Bendixson Rank of Certain Bridgeland-Smith Stability
  Conditions

  We provide a novel proof that the set of directions that admit a saddle
connection on a meromorphic quadratic differential with at least one pole of
order at least two is closed, which generalizes a result of Bridgeland and
Smith, and Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke. Secondly, we show that this set has
finite Cantor-Bendixson rank and give a tight bound. Finally, we present a
family of surfaces realizing all possible Cantor-Bendixson ranks. The
techniques in the proof of this result exclusively concern Abelian
differentials on Riemann surfaces, also known as translation surfaces. The
concept of a "slit translation surface" is introduced as the primary tool for
studying meromorphic quadratic differentials with higher order poles.


The diffusion equation with nonlocal data

  We study the diffusion (or heat) equation on a finite 1-dimensional spatial
domain, but we replace one of the boundary conditions with a "nonlocal
condition", through which we specify a weighted average of the solution over
the spatial interval. We provide conditions on the regularity of both the data
and weight for the problem to admit a unique solution, and also provide a
solution representation in terms of contour integrals. The solution and
well-posedness results rely upon an extension of the Fokas (or unified)
transform method to initial-nonlocal value problems for linear equations; the
necessary extensions are described in detail. Despite arising naturally from
the Fokas transform method, the uniqueness argument appears to be novel even
for initial-boundary value problems.


X-ray Emission from Isolated Be Stars

  I discuss the X-ray observations of Be stars, and how their properties
compare to non-emission B stars. I focus on several specific stars that show
high flux levels and variability but also report on several interesting survey
results. The Be X-ray properties are discussed in the context of wind-shock
X-ray emission from normal OB stars as well as in the context of general
mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the Be phenomenon. Finally, I
conclude with a discussion of the spectral diagnostics that will be available
from the new generation of X-ray telescopes.


Regularity of volume-minimizing flows on 3-manifolds

  In this article, we show that, for any compact 3-manifold, there is a $C^{1}$
volume-minimizing one-dimensional foliation. More generally, we show the
existence of mass-minimizing rectifiable sections of sphere bundles without
isolated "pole points" in the base manifold. This same analysis is used to show
that the examples, due to Sharon Pedersen, of potentially volume-minimizing
rectifiable sections (rectifiable foliations) of the unit tangent bundle to
$S^{2n+1}$ are not, in fact, volume minimizing.


Exactness of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantisation for two non-central potentials

  In this paper we demonstrate the integrability of the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation for two non-central potentials in spherical polar coordinates, and
present complete solutions for the classically bound orbits. We then show that
the semiclassical method of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantisation exactly reproduces the
bound state spectra of the corresponding quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger
equations. One of these potentials has previously been analysed in parabolic
coordinates; the results for the other are, to the authors' best knowledge,
original.


Inelastic Dark Matter

  Many observations suggest that much of the matter of the universe is
non-baryonic. Recently, the DAMA NaI dark matter direct detection experiment
reported an annual modulation in their event rate consistent with a WIMP relic.
However, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Ge experiment excludes most of
the region preferred by DAMA. We demonstrate that if the dark matter can only
scatter by making a transition to a slightly heavier state (Delta m ~ 100kev),
the experiments are no longer in conflict. Moreover, differences in the energy
spectrum of nuclear recoil events could distinguish such a scenario from the
standard WIMP scenario. Finally, we discuss the sneutrino as a candidate for
inelastic dark matter in supersymmetric theories.


Network Automata: Coupling structure and function in real-world networks

  We introduce Network Automata, a framework which couples the topological
evolution of a network to its structure. It is useful for dealing with networks
in which the topology evolves according to some specified microscopic rules
and, simultaneously, there is a dynamic process taking place on the network
that both depends on its structure but is also capable of modifying it. It is a
generic framework for modeling systems in which network structure, dynamics,
and function are interrelated. At the practical level, this framework allows
for easy implementation of the microscopic rules involved in such systems. To
demonstrate the approach, we develop a class of simple biologically inspired
models of fungal growth.


Accelerating networks

  Evolving out-of-equilibrium networks have been under intense scrutiny
recently. In many real-world settings the number of links added per new node is
not constant but depends on the time at which the node is introduced in the
system. This simple idea gives rise to the concept of accelerating networks,
for which we review an existing definition and -- after finding it somewhat
constrictive -- offer a new definition. The new definition provided here views
network acceleration as a time dependent property of a given system, as opposed
to being a property of the specific algorithm applied to grow the network. The
defnition also covers both unweighted and weighted networks. As time-stamped
network data becomes increasingly available, the proposed measures may be
easily carried out on empirical datasets. As a simple case study we apply the
concepts to study the evolution of three different instances of Wikipedia,
namely, those in English, German, and Japanese, and find that the networks
undergo different acceleration regimes in their evolution.


Surface accumulation of spermatozoa: a fluid dynamic phenomenon

  Recent mathematical fluid dynamics models have shed light into an outstanding
problem in reproductive biology: why do spermatozoa cells show a 'preference'
for swimming near to surfaces? In this paper we review quantitative approaches
to the problem, originating with the classic paper of Lord Rothschild in 1963.
A recent 'boundary integral/slender body theory' mathematical model for the
fluid dynamics is described, and we discuss how it gives insight into the
mechanisms that may be responsible for the surface accumulation behaviour. We
use the simulation model to explore these mechanisms in more detail, and
discuss whether simplified models can capture the behaviour of sperm cells. The
far-field decay of the fluid flow around the cell is calculated, and compared
with a stresslet model. Finally we present some new findings showing how,
despite having a relatively small hydrodynamic drag, the sperm cell 'head' has
very significant effects on surface accumulation and trajectory.
