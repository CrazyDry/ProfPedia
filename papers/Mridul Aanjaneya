Triangulating the Real Projective Plane

  We consider the problem of computing a triangulation of the real projectiveplane P2, given a finite point set S={p1, p2,..., pn} as input. We prove that atriangulation of P2 always exists if at least six points in S are in generalposition, i.e., no three of them are collinear. We also design an algorithm fortriangulating P2 if this necessary condition holds. As far as we know, this isthe first computational result on the real projective plane.

Tromino tilings of Domino-Deficient Rectangles

  We consider tromino tilings of $m\times n$ domino-deficient rectangles, where$3|(mn-2)$ and $m,n\geq0$, and characterize all cases of domino removal thatadmit such tilings, thereby settling the open problem posed by J. M. Ash and S.Golomb in \cite {marshall}. Based on this characterization, we design aprocedure for constructing such a tiling if one exists. We also consider theproblem of counting such tilings and derive the exact formula for the number oftilings for $2\times(3t+1)$ rectangles, the exact generating function for$4\times(3t+2)$ rectangles, where $t\geq0$, and an upper bound on the number oftromino tilings for $m\times n$ domino-deficient rectangles. We also considergeneral 2-deficiency in $n\times4$ rectangles, where $n\geq8$, and characterizeall pairs of squares which do not permit a tromino tiling.

Faultfree Tromino Tilings of Rectangles

  In this paper we consider faultfree tromino tilings of rectangles andcharacterize rectangles that admit such tilings. We introduce the notion of{\it crossing numbers} for tilings and derive bounds on the crossing numbers offaultfree tilings. We develop an iterative scheme for generating faultfreetromino tilings for rectangles and derive the closed form expression for theexact number of faultfree tromino tilings for $4\times3t$ rectangles and theexact generating function for $5\times 3t$ rectangles, $t\geq 1$. Our iterativescheme generalizes to arbitrary rectangles; for $6\times 6t$ and $7\times 6t$rectangles, $t\geq 1$, we derive generating functions for estimating lowerbounds on the number of faultfree tilings. We also derive an upper bound on thenumber of tromino tilings of an $m\times n$ rectangle, where $3|mn$ and$m,n>0$.
