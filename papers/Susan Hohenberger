Tetris is Hard, Even to Approximate

  In the popular computer game of Tetris, the player is given a sequence oftetromino pieces and must pack them into a rectangular gameboard initiallyoccupied by a given configuration of filled squares; any completely filled rowof the gameboard is cleared and all pieces above it drop by one row. We provethat in the offline version of Tetris, it is NP-complete to maximize the numberof cleared rows, maximize the number of tetrises (quadruples of rowssimultaneously filled and cleared), minimize the maximum height of an occupiedsquare, or maximize the number of pieces placed before the game ends. Wefurthermore show the extreme inapproximability of the first and last of theseobjectives to within a factor of p^(1-epsilon), when given a sequence of ppieces, and the inapproximability of the third objective to within a factor of(2 - epsilon), for any epsilon>0. Our results hold under several variations onthe rules of Tetris, including different models of rotation, limitations onplayer agility, and restricted piece sets.

Complexity of a Tetris variant

  In this paper we are going to solve an open problem about the game tetris. Weare going to give the first results in the complexity of a variant of offlinetetris introduced by Erik Demaine, Susan Hohenberger and David Liben Nowell intheir paper "Tetris is hard, even to approximate". In this variant, thatfollows a model of movements introduced by John Brzustowsky, we can move androtate a piece the number of times we want in the first row. But then, when weleft the piece fall, we cannot move it or rotate it anymore. We are going todemonstrate that the problem of maximizing the number of cleared lines of thisvariant on a particular game board, is NP-hard by reducing the 3-partitionproblem to the problem of clearing the board in this variant of tetris
