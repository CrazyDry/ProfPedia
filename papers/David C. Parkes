Supersymmetrically transformed periodic potentials

  The higher order supersymmetric partners of a stationary periodic potentialare studied. The transformation functions associated to the band edges do notchange the spectral structure. However, when the transformation is implementedfor factorization energies inside of the forbidden bands, the final potentialwill have again the initial band structure but it can have bound statesencrusted into the gaps, giving place to localized periodicity defects.

The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Wide-bandwidth  Digital Instrumentation for the CSIRO Parkes 64-m Telescope

  Breakthrough Listen is a ten-year initiative to search for signatures oftechnologies created by extraterrestrial civilizations at radio and opticalwavelengths. Here, we detail the digital data recording system deployed forBreakthrough Listen observations at the 64-m aperture CSIRO Parkes Telescope inNew South Wales, Australia. The recording system currently implements tworecording modes: a dual-polarization, 1.125 GHz bandwidth mode for single beamobservations, and a 26-input, 308-MHz bandwidth mode for the 21-cm multibeamreceiver. The system is also designed to support a 3 GHz single-beam mode forthe forthcoming Parkes ultra-wideband feed. In this paper, we present detailsof the system architecture, provide an overview of hardware and software, andpresent initial performance results.

Viewpoint: Journals for Certification, Conferences for Rapid  Dissemination

  The publication culture in Computer Science is different from that of allother disciplines. Whereas other disciplines focus on journal publication, thestandard practice in CS has been to publish in a conference and then(sometimes) publish a journal version of the conference paper. We discuss therole of journal publication in CS.  Indeed, it is through publication in selective, leading conferences that thequality of CS research is typically assessed.

Electronic structure and magnetic anisotropy for nickel-based molecular  magnets

  Recent magnetic measurements on tetra-nickel molecular magnets[Ni(hmp)(ROH)Cl]$_4$, where R=CH$_3$, CH$_2$CH$_3$, or(CH$_2$)$_2$C(CH$_3$)$_3$ and hmp$^-$ is the monoanion of2-hydroxymethylpyridine, revealed a strong exchange bias prior to the externalmagnetic field reversal as well as anomalies in electron paramagnetic resonancepeaks at low temperatures. To understand the exchange bias and observedanomalies, we calculate the electronic structure and magnetic properties forthe Ni$_4$ molecules with the three different ligands, employingdensity-functional theory. Considering the optimized structure with possiblecollinear spin configurations, we determine a total spin of the lowest-energystate to be S=0, which does not agree with experiment. We also calculatemagnetic anisotropy barriers for all three types of Ni$_4$ molecules to be inthe range of 4-6 K.

Breaking of valley degeneracy by magnetic field in monolayer MoSe2

  Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we investigatevalley degeneracy breaking by out-of-plane magnetic field in back-gatedmonolayer MoSe$_2$ devices. We observe a linear splitting of $-0.22\frac{\text{meV}}{\text{T}}$ between luminescence peak energies in $\sigma_{+}$and $\sigma_{-}$ emission for both neutral and charged excitons. The opticalselection rules of monolayer MoSe$_2$ couple photon handedness to the excitonvalley degree of freedom, so this splitting demonstrates valley degeneracybreaking. In addition, we find that the luminescence handedness can becontrolled with magnetic field, to a degree that depends on the back-gatevoltage. An applied magnetic field therefore provides effective strategies forcontrol over the valley degree of freedom.

Spatiotemporal Mapping of Photocurrent in a Monolayer Semiconductor  Using a Diamond Quantum Sensor

  The detection of photocurrents is central to understanding and harnessing theinteraction of light with matter. Although widely used, transport-baseddetection averages over spatial distributions and can suffer from lowphotocarrier collection efficiency. Here, we introduce a contact-free method tospatially resolve local photocurrent densities using a proximal quantummagnetometer. We interface monolayer MoS2 with a near-surface ensemble ofnitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and map the generated photothermal currentdistribution through its magnetic field profile. By synchronizing thephotoexcitation with dynamical decoupling of the sensor spin, we extend thesensor's quantum coherence and achieve sensitivities to alternating currentdensities as small as 20 nA per micron. Our spatiotemporal measurements revealthat the photocurrent circulates as vortices, manifesting the Nernst effect,and rises with a timescale indicative of the system's thermal properties. Ourmethod establishes an unprecedented probe for optoelectronic phenomena, ideallysuited to the emerging class of two-dimensional materials, and stimulatesapplications towards large-area photodetectors and stick-on sources of magneticfields for quantum control.

Charge Density Wave Modulation in Superconducting BaPbO$_3$/BaBiO$_3$  Superlattices

  The isotropic, non-magnetic doped BaBiO$_3$ superconductors maintain somesimilarities to high-Tc cuprates, while also providing a cleaner system forisolating charge density wave (CDW) physics that commonly competes withsuperconductivity. Artificial layered superlattices offer the possibility ofengineering the interaction between superconductivity and CDW. Here westabilize a low temperature, fluctuating short range CDW order by usingartificially layered epitaxial (BaPbO$_3$)$_{3m}$/(BaBiO$_3$)$_m$ (m = 1-10unit cells) superlattices that is not present in the optimally dopedBaPb$_{0.75}$Bi$_{0.25}$O$_3$ alloy with the same overall chemical formula.Charge transfer from BaBiO$_3$ to BaPbO$_3$ effectively dopes the former andsuppresses the long range CDW, however as the short range CDW fluctuationsstrengthens at low temperatures charge appears to localize andsuperconductivity is weakened. The monolayer structural control demonstratedhere provides compelling implications to access controllable, localdensity-wave orders absent in bulk alloys and manipulate phase competition inunconventional superconductors.

The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Target Selection of  Nearby Stars and Galaxies

  We present the target selection for the Breakthrough Listen search forextraterrestrial intelligence during the first year of observations at theGreen Bank Telescope, Parkes Telescope and Automated Planet Finder. On the wayto observing 1,000,000 nearby stars in search of technological signals, wepresent three main sets of objects we plan to observe in addition to a smallersample of exotica. We choose the 60 nearest stars, all within 5.1 pc from thesun. Such nearby stars offer the potential to observe faint radio signals fromtransmitters having a power similar to those on Earth. We add a list of 1649stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog that span the Hertzprung-Russelldiagram, including all spectral types along the main sequence, subgiants, andgiant stars. This sample offers diversity and inclusion of all stellar types,but with thoughtful limits and due attention to main sequence stars. Ourtargets also include 123 nearby galaxies composed of a"morphological-type-complete" sample of the nearest spirals, ellipticals, dwarfspherioidals, and irregulars. While their great distances hamper the detectionof technological electromagnetic radiation, galaxies offer the opportunity toobserve billions of stars simultaneously and to sample the bright end of thetechnological luminosity function. We will also use the Green Bank and Parkestelescopes to survey the plane and central bulge of the Milky Way. Finally, thecomplete target list includes several classes of exotica, including whitedwarfs, brown dwarfs, black holes, neutron stars, and asteroids in our SolarSystem.

Exploring the intrabinary shock from the redback millisecond pulsar PSR  J2129-0429

  We have investigated the intrabinary shock emission from the redbackmillisecond pulsar PSR J2129-0429 with XMM-Newton and Fermi. Orbital modulationin X-ray and UV can be clearly seen. Its X-ray modulation has a double-peakstructure with a dip in between. The observed X-rays are non-thermal dominantwhich can be modeled by a power-law with a photon index of ~1.2. Intrabinaryshock can be the origin of the observed X-rays. The UV light curve is resultedfrom the ellipsoidal modulation of the companion. Modeling the UV light curveprefers a large viewing angle. The heating effect of the UV light curve isfound to be negligible which suggests the high energy radiation beam of PSRJ2129-0429 does not direct toward its companion. On the other hand, nosignificant orbital modulation can be found in gamma-ray which suggests themajority of the gamma-rays come from the pulsar.

A Wide-Field HI Study of the NGC 1566 Group

  We report on neutral hydrogen observations of a ~ 5.5 x 5.5 degree fieldaround the NGC 1566 galaxy group with the multibeam narrow-band system on the64-m Parkes telescope. We detected thirteen HI sources in the field, includingtwo galaxies not previously known to be members of the group, bringing thetotal number of confirmed galaxies in this group to 26. Each of the HI galaxiescan be associated with an optically catalogued galaxy. No 'intergalactic HIclouds' were found to an HI mass limit of ~ 3.5 x 10^8 Msun. We have estimatedthe expected HI content of the late-type galaxies in this group and find thetotal detected HI is consistent with our expectations. However, while no globalHI deficiency is inferred for this group, two galaxies exhibit individual HIdeficiencies. Further observations are needed to determine the gas removalmechanisms in these galaxies.

Signatures of Molecular Magnetism in Single-Molecule Transport  Spectroscopy

  Single-molecule transistors provide a unique experimental tool to investigatethe coupling between charge transport and the molecular degrees of freedom inindividual molecules. One interesting class of molecules for such experimentsare the single-molecule magnets, since the intramolecular exchange forcespresent in these molecules should couple strongly to the spin of transportelectrons, thereby providing both new mechanisms for modulating electron flowand also new means for probing nanoscale magnetic excitations. Here we reportsingle-molecule transistor measurements on devices incorporating Mn12molecules. By studying the electron-tunneling spectrum as a function ofmagnetic field, we are able to identify clear signatures of magnetic states andtheir associated magnetic anisotropy. A comparison of the data to simulationsalso suggests that electron flow can strongly enhance magnetic relaxation ofthe magnetic molecule.

Minimal Economic Distributed Computing

  In an ideal distributed computing infrastructure, users would be able to usediverse distributed computing resources in a simple coherent way, withguaranteed security and efficient use of shared resources in accordance withthe wishes of the owners of the resources. Our strategy for approaching thisideal is to first find the simplest structure within which these goals canplausibly be achieved. This structure, we find, is given by a particularrecursive distributive lattice freely constructed from a presumed partiallyordered set of all data in the infrastructure. Minor syntactic adjustments tothe resulting algebra yields a simple language resembling a UNIX shell, aconcept of execution and an interprocess protocol. Persons, organizations andservers within the system express their interests explicitly via a hierarchicalcurrency. The currency provides a common framework for treating authentication,access control and resource sharing as economic problems while also introducinga new dimension for improving the infrastructure over time by designing systemcomponents which compete with each other to earn the currency. We explain theseresults, discuss experience with an implementation called egg and point outareas where more research is needed.

Fermi Surface of Alpha-Uranium at Ambient Pressure

  We have performed de Haas-van Alphen measurements of the Fermi surface ofalpha-uranium single crystals at ambient pressure within the alpha-3 chargedensity wave (CDW) state from 0.020 K - 10 K and magnetic fields to 35 T usingtorque magnetometry. The angular dependence of the resulting frequencies isdescribed. Effective masses were measured and the Dingle temperature wasdetermined to be 0.74 K +/- 0.04 K. The observation of quantum oscillationswithin the alpha-3 CDW state gives new insight into the effect of the chargedensity waves on the Fermi surface. In addition we observed no signature ofsuperconductivity in either transport or magnetization down to 0.020 Kindicating the possibility of a pressure-induced quantum critical point thatseparates the superconducting dome from the normal CDW phase.

The Membership and Distance of the Open Cluster Collinder 419

  The young open cluster Collinder 419 surrounds the massive O star, HD 193322,that is itself a remarkable multiple star system containing at least fourcomponents. Here we present a discussion of the cluster distance based upon newspectral classifications of the brighter members, UBV photometry, and ananalysis of astrometric and photometric data from the UCAC3 and 2MASS catalogs.We determine an average cluster reddening of E(B-V)=0.37 +- 0.05 mag and acluster distance of 741 +- 36 pc. The cluster probably contains some very youngstars that may include a reddened M3 III star, IRAS~20161+4035.

Simplicity-Expressiveness Tradeoffs in Mechanism Design

  A fundamental result in mechanism design theory, the so-called revelationprinciple, asserts that for many questions concerning the existence ofmechanisms with a given outcome one can restrict attention to truthful directrevelation-mechanisms. In practice, however, many mechanism use a restrictedmessage space. This motivates the study of the tradeoffs involved in choosingsimplified mechanisms, which can sometimes bring benefits in precluding bad orpromoting good equilibria, and other times impose costs on welfare and revenue.We study the simplicity-expressiveness tradeoff in two representative settings,sponsored search auctions and combinatorial auctions, each being a canonicalexample for complete information and incomplete information analysis,respectively. We observe that the amount of information available to the agentsplays an important role for the tradeoff between simplicity and expressiveness.

Quantifying the Strategyproofness of Mechanisms via Metrics on Payoff  Distributions

  Strategyproof mechanisms provide robust equilibrium with minimal assumptionsabout knowledge and rationality but can be unachievable in combination withother desirable properties such as budget-balance, stability against deviationsby coalitions, and computational tractability. In the search formaximally-strategyproof mechanisms that simultaneously satisfy other desirableproperties, we introduce a new metric to quantify the strategyproofness of amechanism, based on comparing the payoff distribution, given truthful reports,against that of a strategyproof "reference" mechanism that solves a problemrelaxation. Focusing on combinatorial exchanges, we demonstrate that the metricis informative about the eventual equilibrium, where simple regretbased metricsare not, and can be used for online selection of an effective mechanism.

Learning and Solving Many-Player Games through a Cluster-Based  Representation

  In addressing the challenge of exponential scaling with the number of agentswe adopt a cluster-based representation to approximately solve asymmetric gamesof very many players. A cluster groups together agents with a similar"strategic view" of the game. We learn the clustered approximation from dataconsisting of strategy profiles and payoffs, which may be obtained fromobservations of play or access to a simulator. Using our clustering weconstruct a reduced "twins" game in which each cluster is associated with twoplayers of the reduced game. This allows our representation to be individually-responsive because we align the interests of every individual agent with thestrategy of its cluster. Our approach provides agents with higher payoffs andlower regret on average than model-free methods as well as previouscluster-based methods, and requires only few observations for learning to besuccessful. The "twins" approach is shown to be an important component ofproviding these low regret approximations.

Optimal Coordinated Planning Amongst Self-Interested Agents with Private  State

  Consider a multi-agent system in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Eachagent's local decision problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)and agents must coordinate on a joint action in each period, which provides areward to each agent and causes local state transitions. A social planner knowsthe model of every agent's MDP and wants to implement the optimal joint policy,but agents are self-interested and have private local state. We provide anincentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting state information that achievesthe optimal joint plan in a Markov perfect equilibrium of the inducedstochastic game. In the special case in which local problems are Markov chainsand agents compete to take a single action in each period, we leverage Gittinsallocation indices to provide an efficient factored algorithm and distributecomputation of the optimal policy among the agents. Distributed, optimalcoordinated learning in a multi-agent variant of the multi-armed bandit problemis obtained as a special case.

Models for Truthful Online Double Auctions

  Online double auctions (DAs) model a dynamic two-sided matching problem withprivate information and self-interest, and are relevant for dynamic resourceand task allocation problems. We present a general method to design truthfulDAs, such that no agent can benefit from misreporting its arrival time,duration, or value. The family of DAs is parameterized by a pricing rule, andincludes a generalization of McAfee's truthful DA to this dynamic setting. Wepresent an empirical study, in which we study the allocative-surplus and agentsurplus for a number of different DAs. Our results illustrate that dynamicpricing rules are important to provide good market efficiency for markets withhigh volatility or low volume.

Payment Rules through Discriminant-Based Classifiers

  In mechanism design it is typical to impose incentive compatibility and thenderive an optimal mechanism subject to this constraint. By replacing theincentive compatibility requirement with the goal of minimizing expected expost regret, we are able to adapt statistical machine learning techniques tothe design of payment rules. This computational approach to mechanism design isapplicable to domains with multi-dimensional types and situations wherecomputational efficiency is a concern. Specifically, given an outcome rule andaccess to a type distribution, we train a support vector machine with a specialdiscriminant function structure such that it implicitly establishes a paymentrule with desirable incentive properties. We discuss applications to amulti-minded combinatorial auction with a greedy winner-determination algorithmand to an assignment problem with egalitarian outcome rule. Experimentalresults demonstrate both that the construction produces payment rules with lowex post regret, and that penalizing classification errors is effective inpreventing failures of ex post individual rationality.

Random Utility Theory for Social Choice

  Random utility theory models an agent's preferences on alternatives bydrawing a real-valued score on each alternative (typically independently) froma parameterized distribution, and then ranking the alternatives according toscores. A special case that has received significant attention is thePlackett-Luce model, for which fast inference methods for maximum likelihoodestimators are available. This paper develops conditions on general randomutility models that enable fast inference within a Bayesian framework throughMC-EM, providing concave loglikelihood functions and bounded sets of globalmaxima solutions. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide supportfor the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection amonggeneral random utility models including Plackett-Luce.

Expressiveness and Robustness of First-Price Position Auctions

  Since economic mechanisms are often applied to very different instances ofthe same problem, it is desirable to identify mechanisms that work well in awide range of circumstances. We pursue this goal for a position auction settingand specifically seek mechanisms that guarantee good outcomes under bothcomplete and incomplete information. A variant of the generalized first-pricemechanism with multi-dimensional bids turns out to be the only standardmechanism able to achieve this goal, even when types are one-dimensional. Thefact that expressiveness beyond the type space is both necessary and sufficientfor this kind of robustness provides an interesting counterpoint to previouswork on position auctions that has highlighted the benefits of simplicity. Froma technical perspective our results are interesting because they establishequilibrium existence for a multi-dimensional bid space, where standardtechniques break down. The structure of the equilibrium bids moreover providesan intuitive explanation for why first-price payments may be able to supportequilibria in a wider range of circumstances than second-price payments.

Miniature Dilatometer Based upon an AFM Piezocantilever

  We report on the development of a sensitive dilatometer based upon a AFMpiezocantilever. This dilatometer has been tested at temperatures down to 25 mKand in magnetic fields up to 16 T. The layered heavy fermion superconductor$CeCoIn_5$ and its non-magnetic analog $LaRhIn_5$ have been measured todemonstrate its use in detecting phase transitions and quantum oscillations. Inaddition, using this dilatometer, a simultaneous multi-axis dilationmeasurement has been done. This compact dilatometer has many advantages such asits ability to measure very small samples with lengths at sub-mm levels, lowtemperature and field dependence, ability to rotate, and works wellirrespective of being in a changing liquid or gas environment (i.e. within aflow cryostat or mixing chamber).

Preference Elicitation For General Random Utility Models

  This paper discusses {General Random Utility Models (GRUMs)}. These are aclass of parametric models that generate partial ranks over alternatives givenattributes of agents and alternatives. We propose two preference elicitationscheme for GRUMs developed from principles in Bayesian experimental design, onefor social choice and the other for personalized choice. We couple this with ageneral Monte-Carlo-Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) based algorithm for MAPinference under GRUMs. We also prove uni-modality of the likelihood functionsfor a class of GRUMs. We examine the performance of various criteria byexperimental studies, which show that the proposed elicitation scheme increasesthe precision of estimation.

Capturing Variation and Uncertainty in Human Judgment

  The well-studied problem of statistical rank aggregation has been applied tocomparing sports teams, information retrieval, and most recently to datagenerated by human judgment. Such human-generated rankings may be substantiallydifferent from traditional statistical ranking data. In this work, we show thata recently proposed generalized random utility model reveals distinctivepatterns in human judgment across three different domains, and provides asuccinct representation of variance in both population preferences andimperfect perception. In contrast, we also show that classical statisticalranking models fail to capture important features from human-generated input.Our work motivates the use of more flexible ranking models for representing anddescribing the collective preferences or decision-making of human participants.

Truthful Prioritization Schemes for Spectrum Sharing

  We design a protocol for dynamic prioritization of data on shared routerssuch as untethered 3G/4G devices. The mechanism prioritizes bandwidth in favorof users with the highest value, and is incentive compatible, so that users cansimply report their true values for network access. A revenue pooling mechanismalso aligns incentives for sellers, so that they will choose to useprioritization methods that retain the incentive properties on the buy-side. Inthis way, the design allows for an open architecture. In addition to revenuepooling, the technical contribution is to identify a class of stochastic demandmodels and a prioritization scheme that provides allocation monotonicity.Simulation results confirm efficiency gains from dynamic prioritizationrelative to prior methods, as well as the effectiveness of revenue pooling.

A Statistical Decision-Theoretic Framework for Social Choice

  In this paper, we take a statistical decision-theoretic viewpoint on socialchoice, putting a focus on the decision to be made on behalf of a system ofagents. In our framework, we are given a statistical ranking model, a decisionspace, and a loss function defined on (parameter, decision) pairs, andformulate social choice mechanisms as decision rules that minimize expectedloss. This suggests a general framework for the design and analysis of newsocial choice mechanisms. We compare Bayesian estimators, which minimizeBayesian expected loss, for the Mallows model and the Condorcet modelrespectively, and the Kemeny rule. We consider various normative properties, inaddition to computational complexity and asymptotic behavior. In particular, weshow that the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model satisfies some desiredproperties such as anonymity, neutrality, and monotonicity, can be computed inpolynomial time, and is asymptotically different from the other two rules whenthe data are generated from the Condorcet model for some ground truthparameter.

Atomically-thin Ohmic Edge Contacts Between Two-dimensional Materials

  With the decrease of the dimensions of electronic devices, the role played byelectrical contacts is ever increasing, eventually coming to dominate theoverall device volume and total resistance. This is especially problematic formonolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which arepromising candidates for atomically thin electronics. Ideal electrical contactsto them would require the use of similarly thin electrode materials whilemaintaining low contact resistances. Here we report a scalable method tofabricate ohmic graphene edge contacts to two representative monolayer TMDs -MoS2 and WS2. The graphene and TMD layer are laterally connected withwafer-scale homogeneity, no observable overlap or gap, and a low averagecontact resistance of 30 k$\Omega$ $\mu$m. The resulting graphene edge contactsshow linear current-voltage (IV) characteristics at room temperature, withohmic behavior maintained down to liquid helium temperatures.

Peer Prediction with Heterogeneous Tasks

  Peer prediction is a method to promote contributions of information by usersin settings in which there is no way to verify the quality of responses. Inmulti-task peer prediction, the reports from users across multiple tasks areused to score contributions. This paper extends the correlated agreement (CA)multi-task peer prediction mechanism to allow the reports from users to be onheterogeneous tasks, each associated with different distributions on responses.The motivation comes from wanting to elicit user-generated content about placesin a city, where tasks vary because places, and questions about places, vary.We prove that the generalized CA mechanism is informed truthful under weakconditions, meaning that it is strictly beneficial for a user to invest effortand acquire information, and that truthful reporting is the best strategy wheninvesting effort, as well as an equilibrium. We demonstrate that the mechanismhas good incentive properties when tested in simulation on distributionsderived from user reports on Google Local Guides.

IOTA (Integrable Optics Test Accelerator): Facility and Experimental  Beam Physics Program

  The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is a storage ring for advancedbeam physics research currently being built and commissioned at Fermilab. Itwill operate with protons and electrons using injectors with momenta of 70 and150 MeV/c, respectively. The research program includes the study of nonlinearfocusing integrable optical beam lattices based on special magnets and electronlenses, beam dynamics of space-charge effects and their compensation, opticalstochastic cooling, and several other experiments. In this article, we presentthe design and main parameters of the facility, outline progress to date andprovide the timeline of the construction, commissioning and research. Thephysical principles, design, and hardware implementation plans for the majorIOTA experiments are also discussed.

Optimal Auctions through Deep Learning

  Designing an incentive compatible auction that maximizes expected revenue isan intricate task. The single-item case was resolved in a seminal piece of workby Myerson in 1981. Even after 30-40 years of intense research the problemremains unsolved for seemingly simple multi-bidder, multi-item settings. Inthis work, we initiate the exploration of the use of tools from deep learningfor the automated design of optimal auctions. We model an auction as amulti-layer neural network, frame optimal auction design as a constrainedlearning problem, and show how it can be solved using standard pipelines. Weprove generalization bounds and present extensive experiments, recoveringessentially all known analytical solutions for multi-item settings, andobtaining novel mechanisms for settings in which the optimal mechanism isunknown.

Calibrated Fairness in Bandits

  We study fairness within the stochastic, \emph{multi-armed bandit} (MAB)decision making framework. We adapt the fairness framework of "treating similarindividuals similarly" to this setting. Here, an `individual' corresponds to anarm and two arms are `similar' if they have a similar quality distribution.First, we adopt a {\em smoothness constraint} that if two arms have a similarquality distribution then the probability of selecting each arm should besimilar. In addition, we define the {\em fairness regret}, which corresponds tothe degree to which an algorithm is not calibrated, where perfect calibrationrequires that the probability of selecting an arm is equal to the probabilitywith which the arm has the best quality realization. We show that a variationon Thompson sampling satisfies smooth fairness for total variation distance,and give an $\tilde{O}((kT)^{2/3})$ bound on fairness regret. This complementsprior work, which protects an on-average better arm from being less favored. Wealso explain how to extend our algorithm to the dueling bandit setting.

Amplified Sensitivity of Nitrogen-Vacancy Spins in Nanodiamonds using  All-Optical Charge Readout

  Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers offer a versatileplatform for sensing applications spanning from nanomagnetism to in-vivomonitoring of cellular processes. In many cases, however, weak optical signalsand poor contrast demand long acquisition times that prevent the measurement ofenvironmental dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the ability to perform fast,high-contrast optical measurements of charge distributions in ensembles of NVcenters in nanodiamonds and use the technique to improve the spin readoutsignal-to-noise ratio through spin-to-charge conversion. A study of 38nanodiamonds, each hosting 10-15 NV centers with an average diameter of 40 nm,uncovers complex, multiple-timescale dynamics due to radiative andnon-radiative ionization and recombination processes. Nonetheless, thenanodiamonds universally exhibit charge-dependent photoluminescence contrastsand the potential for enhanced spin readout using spin-to-charge conversion. Weuse the technique to speed up a $T_1$ relaxometry measurement by a factor offive.

Fabrication of (111)-Faced Single-Crystal Diamond Plates by Laser  Nucleated Cleaving

  Single-crystal diamond plates with surfaces oriented in a (111) crystal planeare required for high-performance solid-state device platforms ranging frompower electronics to quantum information processing architectures. However,producing plates with this orientation has proven challenging. In this paper,we demonstrate a method for reliably and precisely fabricating (111)-facedplates from commercially available, chemical-vapor-deposition-grown, type-IIasingle-crystal diamond substrates with (100) faces. Our method uses ananosecond-pulsed visible laser to nucleate and propagate a mechanical cleavein a chosen (111) crystal plane, resulting in faces as large as 3.0mm$\times$0.3 mm with atomically flat surfaces, negligible miscut angles, andnear zero kerf loss. We discuss the underlying physical mechanisms of theprocess along with potential improvements that will enable the production ofmillimeter-scale (111)-faced single-crystal diamond plates for a variety ofemerging devices and applications.

Spatio-Temporal Pricing for Ridesharing Platforms

  Ridesharing platforms match drivers and riders to trips, using dynamic pricesto balance supply and demand. A challenge is to set prices that areappropriately smooth in space and time, so that drivers will choose to accepttheir dispatched trips, rather than drive to another area or wait for higherprices or a better trip. We work in a complete information, discrete time,multi-period, multi-location model, and introduce the Spatio-Temporal Pricing(STP) mechanism. The mechanism is incentive-aligned, in that it is asubgame-perfect equilibrium for drivers to accept their dispatches. Themechanism is also welfare-optimal, envy-free, individually rational, budgetbalanced and core-selecting from any history onward. The proof of incentivealignment makes use of the $M^\natural$ concavity of min-cost flow objectives.We also give an impossibility result, that there can be no dominant-strategymechanism with the same economic properties. An empirical analysis conducted insimulation suggests that the STP mechanism can achieve significantly highersocial welfare than a myopic pricing mechanism.

Optimizing cluster-based randomized experiments under a monotonicity  assumption

  Cluster-based randomized experiments are popular designs for mitigating thebias of standard estimators when interference is present and classical causalinference and experimental design assumptions (such as SUTVA or ITR) do nothold. Without an exact knowledge of the interference structure, it can bechallenging to understand which partitioning of the experimental units isoptimal to minimize the estimation bias. In the paper, we introduce amonotonicity condition under which a novel two-stage experimental design allowsus to determine which of two cluster-based designs yields the least biasedestimator. We then consider the setting of online advertising auctions and showthat reserve price experiments verify the monotonicity condition and theproposed framework and methodology applies. We validate our findings on anadvertising auction dataset.

Social Choice with Non Quasi-linear Utilities

  Without monetary payments, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem proves thatunder mild requirements all truthful social choice mechanisms must bedictatorships. When payments are allowed, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)mechanism implements the value-maximizing choice, and has many other goodproperties: it is strategy-proof, onto, deterministic, individually rational,and does not make positive transfers to the agents. By Roberts' theorem, withthree or more alternatives, the weighted VCG mechanisms are essentially uniquefor domains with quasi-linear utilities. The goal of this paper is tocharacterize domains of non-quasi-linear utilities where "reasonable"mechanisms (with VCG-like properties) exist. Our main result is a tightcharacterization of the maximal non quasi-linear utility domain, which we callthe largest parallel domain. We extend Roberts' theorem to parallel domains,and use the generalized theorem to prove two impossibility results. First, anyreasonable mechanism must be dictatorial when the utility domain isquasi-linear together with any single non-parallel type. Second, for richerutility domains that still differ very slightly from quasi-linearity, everystrategy-proof, onto and deterministic mechanism must be a dictatorship.

The Capacity Constrained Facility Location problem

  We initiate the study of the capacity constrained facility location problemfrom a mechanism design perspective. The capacity constrained setting leads toa new strategic environment where a facility serves a subset of the population,which is endogenously determined by the ex-post Nash equilibrium of an inducedsubgame and is not directly controlled by the mechanism designer. Our focus ison mechanisms that are ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DIC) atthe reporting stage. We provide a complete characterization of DIC mechanismsvia the family of Generalized Median Mechanisms (GMMs). In general, the socialwelfare optimal mechanism is not DIC. Adopting the worst-case approximationmeasure, we attain tight lower bounds on the approximation ratio of any DICmechanism. The well-known median mechanism is shown to be optimal among thefamily of DIC mechanisms for certain capacity ranges. Surprisingly, theframework we introduce provides a new characterization for the family of GMMs,and is responsive to gaps in the current social choice literature highlightedby Border and Jordan (1983) and Barbar{\`a}, Mass{\'o} and Serizawa (1998).

Artificial Intelligence for Social Good

  The Computing Community Consortium (CCC), along with the White House Officeof Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the Association for theAdvancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), co-sponsored a public workshopon Artificial Intelligence for Social Good on June 7th, 2016 in Washington, DC.This was one of five workshops that OSTP co-sponsored and held around thecountry to spur public dialogue on artificial intelligence, machine learning,and to identify challenges and opportunities related to AI. In the AI forSocial Good workshop, the successful deployments and the potential use of AI invarious topics that are essential for social good were discussed, including butnot limited to urban computing, health, environmental sustainability, andpublic welfare. This report highlights each of these as well as a number ofcrosscutting issues.

Photoresponse of a strongly correlated material determined by scanning  photocurrent microscopy

  The generation of a current by light is a key process in optoelectronic andphotovoltaic devices. In band semiconductors, depletion fields associated withinterfaces separate long-lived photo-induced carriers. However, in systems withstrong electron-electron and electron-phonon correlations it is unclear whatphysics will dominate the photoresponse. Here we investigate photocurrent in avanadium dioxide, an exemplary strongly correlated material known for itsdramatic metal-insulator transition (MIT) at Tc = 68 C which could be usefulfor optoelectronic detection and switching up to ultraviolet wavelengths. Usingscanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) on individual suspended VO2 nanobeamswe observe photoresponse peaked at the metal-insulator boundary but extendedthroughout both insulating and metallic phases. We determine that the responseis photo-thermal, implying efficient carrier relaxation to a local equilibriumin a manner consistent with strong correlations. Temperature dependentmeasurements reveal subtle phase changes within the insulating state. Wefurther demonstrate switching of the photocurrent by optical control of themetal-insulator boundary arrangement. Our work shows the value of SPCM appliedto nanoscale crystals for investigating strongly correlated materials, and theresults are relevant for designing and controlling optoelectronic devicesemploying such materials.

Measurement of a solid-state triple point at the metal-insulator  transition in VO2

  First-order phase transitions in solids are notoriously challenging to study.The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion,and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domainstructure, hysteresis, and cracking. The situation is still worse near a triplepoint where more than two phases are involved. The famous metal-insulatortransition (MIT) in vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast opticaland electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 isone of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficultiesposed by the first-order nature of the MIT as well as the involvement of atleast two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy aboutits nature. Here, we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in apurpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of thisprototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Ourresults include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic andtwo insulating phases is at the transition temperature, T_tr = T_c, which wedetermine to be 65.0 +- 0.1 C. The findings have profound implications for themechanism of the MIT in VO2, but in addition they demonstrate the importance ofsuch an approach for mastering phase transitions in many other stronglycorrelated materials, such as manganites and iron-based superconductors.

ALMA Multi-line Imaging of the Nearby Starburst Galaxy NGC 253

  We present spatially resolved ($\sim$50 pc) imaging of molecular gas speciesin the central kiloparsec of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, based onobservations taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array(ALMA). A total of 50 molecular lines are detected over a 13 GHz bandwidthimaged in the 3 mm band. Unambiguous identifications are assigned for 27 lines.Based on the measured high CO/C$^{17}$O isotopic line ratio ($\gtrsim$350), weshow that $^{12}$CO(1-0) has moderate optical depths. A comparison of the HCNand HCO$^{+}$ with their $^{13}$C-substituted isotopologues shows that theHCN(1-0) and HCO$^{+}$(1-0) lines have optical depths at least comparable toCO(1-0). H$^{13}$CN/H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (and H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C) line ratiosprovide tighter constraints on dense gas properties in this starburst. SiO haselevated abundances across the nucleus. HNCO has the most distinctivemorphology of all the bright lines, with its global luminosity dominated by theouter parts of the central region. The dramatic variation seen in the HNCO/SiOline ratio suggests that some of the chemical signatures of shocked gas arebeing erased in the presence of dominating central radiation fields (traced byC$_{2}$H and CN). High density molecular gas tracers (including HCN, HCO$^+$,and CN) are detected at the base of the molecular outflow. We also detecthydrogen $\beta$ recombination lines that, like their $\alpha$ counterparts,show compact, centrally peaked morphologies, distinct from the molecular gastracers. A number of sulfur based species are mapped (CS, SO, NS, C$_{2}$S,H$_{2}$CS and CH$_{3}$SH) and have morphologies similar to SiO.

Bulk properties of van-der-Waals hard ferromagnet VI3

  We present comprehensive measurements of the structural, magnetic andelectronic properties of layered van-der-Waals ferromagnet VI$_3$ down to lowtemperatures. Despite belonging to a well studied family of transition metaltrihalides, this material has received very little attention. We outline, fromhigh-resolution powder x-ray diffraction measurements, a correctedroom-temperature crystal structure to that previously proposed and uncover astructural transition at 79 K, also seen in the heat capacity. Magnetizationmeasurements confirm VI$_3$ to be a hard ferromagnet (9.1 kOe coercive field at2 K) with a high degree of anisotropy, and the pressure dependence of themagnetic properties provide evidence for the two-dimensional nature of themagnetic order. Optical and electrical transport measurements show thismaterial to be an insulator with an optical band gap of 0.67 eV - the previoustheoretical predictions of d-band metallicity then lead us to believe VI$_3$ tobe a correlated Mott insulator. Our latest band structure calculations supportthis picture and show good agreement with the experimental data. We suggestVI$_3$ to host great potential in the thriving field of low-dimensionalmagnetism and functional materials, together with opportunities to study andmake use of low-dimensional Mott physics.

Measurement of the generalized form factors near threshold via $γ^*  p \to nπ^+$ at high $Q^2$

  We report the first extraction of the pion-nucleon multipoles near theproduction threshold for the $n\pi^+$ channel at relatively high momentumtransfer ($Q^2$ up to 4.2 $\rm{GeV^2}$). The dominance of the s-wave transversemultipole ($E_{0+}$), expected in this region, allowed us to access thegeneralized form factor $G_1$ within the light-cone sum rule (LCSR) frameworkas well as the axial form factor $G_A$. The data analyzed in this work werecollected by the nearly $4\pi$ CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) usinga 5.754 $\rm{GeV}$ electron beam on a proton target. The differential crosssection and the $\pi-N$-multipole $E_{0+}/G_D$ were measured using twodifferent methods, the LCSR and a direct multipole fit. The results from thetwo methods are found to be consistent and almost $Q^2$ independent.

Searches for millisecond pulsar candidates among the unidentified Fermi  objects

  Here we report the results of searching millisecond pulsar (MSP) candidatesfrom the Fermi LAT second source catalog (2FGL). Seven unassociated$\gamma-$ray sources in this catalog are identified as promising MSP candidatesbased on their $\gamma$-ray properties. Through the X-ray analysis, we havedetected possible X-ray counterparts, localized to an arcsecond accuracy. Wehave systematically estimated their X-ray fluxes and compared with thecorresponding $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The X-ray to $\gamma$-ray flux ratios for2FGL J1653.6-0159 and 2FGL J1946.4-5402 are comparable with the typical valuefor pulsars. For 2FGL J1625.2-0020, 2FGL J1653.6-0159 and 2FGL J1946.4-5402,their candidate X-ray counterparts are bright enough for performing a detailedspectral and temporal analysis to discriminate their thermal/non thermal natureand search for the periodic signal. We have also searched for possibleoptical/IR counterparts at the X-ray positions. For the optical/IR sourcecoincident with the brightest X-ray object that associated with 2FGLJ1120.0-2204, its spectral energy distribution is comparable with a late-typestar. Evidence for the variability has also been found by examining its opticallight curve. All the aforementioned 2FGL sources resemble a pulsar in one ormore aspects, which make them as the promising targets for follow-upinvestigations.

The Galaxy Proximity Effect in the Lyman-alpha Forest

  Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations predict that the average opacity of theLy-alpha forest should increase in the neighborhood of galaxies becausegalaxies form in dense environments. Recent observations (Adelberger et al.2002) confirm this expectation at large scales, but they show a decrease ofabsorption at comoving separations Delta_r <~ 1 Mpc/h. We show that thisdiscrepancy is statistically significant, especially for the innermost datapoint at Delta_r <= 0.5 Mpc/h, even though this data point rests on threegalaxy-quasar pairs. Galaxy redshift errors of the expected magnitude areinsufficient to resolve the conflict. Peculiar velocities allow gas at comovingdistances >~ 1 Mpc/h to produce saturated absorption at the galaxy redshift,putting stringent requirements on any ``feedback'' solution. Localphotoionization is insufficient, even if we allow for recurrent AGN activitythat keeps the neutral hydrogen fraction below its equilibrium value. A simple``wind'' model that eliminates all neutral hydrogen in spheres around theobserved galaxies can marginally explain the data, but only if the winds extendto comoving radii ~1.5 Mpc/h.

An HI census of Loose Groups of Galaxies

  We present results from our Parkes Multibeam HI survey of 3 loose groups ofgalaxies that are analogous to the Local Group. This is a survey of groupscontaining only spiral galaxies with mean separations of a few hundred kpc, andtotal areas of approximately 1 sq. Mpc; groups similar to our own Local Group.We present a census of the HI-rich objects in these groups down to an M(HI),1-sigma sensitivity ~7x10^5 M(sun), as well as the detailed properties of thesedetections from follow-up Compact Array observations. We found 7 new HI-richmembers in the 3 groups, all of which have stellar counterparts and are,therefore, typical dwarf galaxies. The ratio of low-mass to high-mass gas-richgalaxies in these groups is less than in the Local Group meaning that the``missing satellite'' problem is not unique. No high-velocity cloud analogswere found in any of the groups. If HVCs in these groups are the same as in theLocal Group, this implies that HVCs must be located within ~300-400 kpc of theMilky Way.

NR/HEP: roadmap for the future

  Physics in curved spacetime describes a multitude of phenomena, ranging fromastrophysics to high energy physics. The last few years have witnessed furtherprogress on several fronts, including the accurate numerical evolution of thegravitational field equations, which now allows highly nonlinear phenomena tobe tamed. Numerical relativity simulations, originally developed to understandstrong field astrophysical processes, could prove extremely useful tounderstand high-energy physics processes like trans-Planckian scattering andgauge-gravity dualities. We present a concise and comprehensive overview of thestate-of-the-art and important open problems in the field(s), along withguidelines for the next years. This writeup is a summary of the "NR/HEPWorkshop" held in Madeira, Portugal from August 31st to September 3rd 2011.

Long-term causal effects of economic mechanisms on agent incentives

  Economic mechanisms administer the allocation of resources to interestedagents based on their self-reported types. One objective in mechanism design isto design a strategyproof process so that no agent will have an incentive tomisreport its type. However, typical analyses of the incentives properties ofmechanisms operate under strong, usually untestable assumptions. Empirical,data-oriented approaches are, at best, under-developed. Furthermore,mechanism/policy evaluation methods usually ignore the dynamic nature of amulti-agent system and are thus inappropriate for estimating long-term effects.We introduce the problem of estimating the causal effects of mechanisms onincentives and frame it under the Rubin causal framework \citep{rubin74,rubin78}. This raises unique technical challenges since the outcome of interest(agent truthfulness) is confounded with strategic interactions and,interestingly, is typically never observed under any mechanism. We develop amethodology to estimate such causal effects that using a prior that is based ona strategic equilibrium model. Working on the domain of kidney exchanges, weshow how to apply our methodology to estimate causal effects of kidneyallocation mechanisms on hospitals' incentives. Our results demonstrate thatthe use of game-theoretic prior captures the dynamic nature of the kidneyexchange multiagent system and shrinks the estimates towards long-term effects,thus improving upon typical methods that completely ignore agents' strategicbehavior.

Inhomogeneity in the ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition dynamics in  VO$_2$

  The insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) of the simple binary compound ofvanadium dioxide VO$_2$ at $\sim 340$ K has been puzzling since its discoverymore than five decades ago. A wide variety of photon and electron probes havebeen applied in search of a satisfactory microscopic mechanistic explanation.However, many of the conclusions drawn have implicitly assumed a {\emhomogeneous} material response. Here, we reveal inherently {\em inhomogeneous}behavior in the study of the dynamics of individual VO$_2$ micro-crystals usinga combination of femtosecond pump-probe microscopy with nano-IR imaging. Thetime scales of the photoinduced bandgap reorganization in the ultrafast IMTvary from $\simeq 40 \pm 8$ fs, i.e., shorter than a suggested phononbottleneck, to $\sim 200\pm20$ fs, with an average value of $80 \pm 25$ fs,similar to results from previous studies on polycrystalline thin films. Thevariation is uncorrelated with crystal size, orientation, transitiontemperature, and initial insulating phase. This together with details of thenano-domain behavior during the thermally-induced IMT suggests a significantsensitivity to local variations in, e.g., doping, defects, and strain of themicrocrystals. The combination of results points to an electronic mechanismdominating the photoinduced IMT in VO$_2$, but also highlights the difficultyof deducing mechanistic information where the intrinsic response in correlatedmatter may not yet have been reached.
