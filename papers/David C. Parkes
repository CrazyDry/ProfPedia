Supersymmetrically transformed periodic potentials

  The higher order supersymmetric partners of a stationary periodic potential
are studied. The transformation functions associated to the band edges do not
change the spectral structure. However, when the transformation is implemented
for factorization energies inside of the forbidden bands, the final potential
will have again the initial band structure but it can have bound states
encrusted into the gaps, giving place to localized periodicity defects.


The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Wide-bandwidth
  Digital Instrumentation for the CSIRO Parkes 64-m Telescope

  Breakthrough Listen is a ten-year initiative to search for signatures of
technologies created by extraterrestrial civilizations at radio and optical
wavelengths. Here, we detail the digital data recording system deployed for
Breakthrough Listen observations at the 64-m aperture CSIRO Parkes Telescope in
New South Wales, Australia. The recording system currently implements two
recording modes: a dual-polarization, 1.125 GHz bandwidth mode for single beam
observations, and a 26-input, 308-MHz bandwidth mode for the 21-cm multibeam
receiver. The system is also designed to support a 3 GHz single-beam mode for
the forthcoming Parkes ultra-wideband feed. In this paper, we present details
of the system architecture, provide an overview of hardware and software, and
present initial performance results.


Viewpoint: Journals for Certification, Conferences for Rapid
  Dissemination

  The publication culture in Computer Science is different from that of all
other disciplines. Whereas other disciplines focus on journal publication, the
standard practice in CS has been to publish in a conference and then
(sometimes) publish a journal version of the conference paper. We discuss the
role of journal publication in CS.
  Indeed, it is through publication in selective, leading conferences that the
quality of CS research is typically assessed.


Electronic structure and magnetic anisotropy for nickel-based molecular
  magnets

  Recent magnetic measurements on tetra-nickel molecular magnets
[Ni(hmp)(ROH)Cl]$_4$, where R=CH$_3$, CH$_2$CH$_3$, or
(CH$_2$)$_2$C(CH$_3$)$_3$ and hmp$^-$ is the monoanion of
2-hydroxymethylpyridine, revealed a strong exchange bias prior to the external
magnetic field reversal as well as anomalies in electron paramagnetic resonance
peaks at low temperatures. To understand the exchange bias and observed
anomalies, we calculate the electronic structure and magnetic properties for
the Ni$_4$ molecules with the three different ligands, employing
density-functional theory. Considering the optimized structure with possible
collinear spin configurations, we determine a total spin of the lowest-energy
state to be S=0, which does not agree with experiment. We also calculate
magnetic anisotropy barriers for all three types of Ni$_4$ molecules to be in
the range of 4-6 K.


Breaking of valley degeneracy by magnetic field in monolayer MoSe2

  Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we investigate
valley degeneracy breaking by out-of-plane magnetic field in back-gated
monolayer MoSe$_2$ devices. We observe a linear splitting of $-0.22
\frac{\text{meV}}{\text{T}}$ between luminescence peak energies in $\sigma_{+}$
and $\sigma_{-}$ emission for both neutral and charged excitons. The optical
selection rules of monolayer MoSe$_2$ couple photon handedness to the exciton
valley degree of freedom, so this splitting demonstrates valley degeneracy
breaking. In addition, we find that the luminescence handedness can be
controlled with magnetic field, to a degree that depends on the back-gate
voltage. An applied magnetic field therefore provides effective strategies for
control over the valley degree of freedom.


Spatiotemporal Mapping of Photocurrent in a Monolayer Semiconductor
  Using a Diamond Quantum Sensor

  The detection of photocurrents is central to understanding and harnessing the
interaction of light with matter. Although widely used, transport-based
detection averages over spatial distributions and can suffer from low
photocarrier collection efficiency. Here, we introduce a contact-free method to
spatially resolve local photocurrent densities using a proximal quantum
magnetometer. We interface monolayer MoS2 with a near-surface ensemble of
nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and map the generated photothermal current
distribution through its magnetic field profile. By synchronizing the
photoexcitation with dynamical decoupling of the sensor spin, we extend the
sensor's quantum coherence and achieve sensitivities to alternating current
densities as small as 20 nA per micron. Our spatiotemporal measurements reveal
that the photocurrent circulates as vortices, manifesting the Nernst effect,
and rises with a timescale indicative of the system's thermal properties. Our
method establishes an unprecedented probe for optoelectronic phenomena, ideally
suited to the emerging class of two-dimensional materials, and stimulates
applications towards large-area photodetectors and stick-on sources of magnetic
fields for quantum control.


Charge Density Wave Modulation in Superconducting BaPbO$_3$/BaBiO$_3$
  Superlattices

  The isotropic, non-magnetic doped BaBiO$_3$ superconductors maintain some
similarities to high-Tc cuprates, while also providing a cleaner system for
isolating charge density wave (CDW) physics that commonly competes with
superconductivity. Artificial layered superlattices offer the possibility of
engineering the interaction between superconductivity and CDW. Here we
stabilize a low temperature, fluctuating short range CDW order by using
artificially layered epitaxial (BaPbO$_3$)$_{3m}$/(BaBiO$_3$)$_m$ (m = 1-10
unit cells) superlattices that is not present in the optimally doped
BaPb$_{0.75}$Bi$_{0.25}$O$_3$ alloy with the same overall chemical formula.
Charge transfer from BaBiO$_3$ to BaPbO$_3$ effectively dopes the former and
suppresses the long range CDW, however as the short range CDW fluctuations
strengthens at low temperatures charge appears to localize and
superconductivity is weakened. The monolayer structural control demonstrated
here provides compelling implications to access controllable, local
density-wave orders absent in bulk alloys and manipulate phase competition in
unconventional superconductors.


The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Target Selection of
  Nearby Stars and Galaxies

  We present the target selection for the Breakthrough Listen search for
extraterrestrial intelligence during the first year of observations at the
Green Bank Telescope, Parkes Telescope and Automated Planet Finder. On the way
to observing 1,000,000 nearby stars in search of technological signals, we
present three main sets of objects we plan to observe in addition to a smaller
sample of exotica. We choose the 60 nearest stars, all within 5.1 pc from the
sun. Such nearby stars offer the potential to observe faint radio signals from
transmitters having a power similar to those on Earth. We add a list of 1649
stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog that span the Hertzprung-Russell
diagram, including all spectral types along the main sequence, subgiants, and
giant stars. This sample offers diversity and inclusion of all stellar types,
but with thoughtful limits and due attention to main sequence stars. Our
targets also include 123 nearby galaxies composed of a
"morphological-type-complete" sample of the nearest spirals, ellipticals, dwarf
spherioidals, and irregulars. While their great distances hamper the detection
of technological electromagnetic radiation, galaxies offer the opportunity to
observe billions of stars simultaneously and to sample the bright end of the
technological luminosity function. We will also use the Green Bank and Parkes
telescopes to survey the plane and central bulge of the Milky Way. Finally, the
complete target list includes several classes of exotica, including white
dwarfs, brown dwarfs, black holes, neutron stars, and asteroids in our Solar
System.


Exploring the intrabinary shock from the redback millisecond pulsar PSR
  J2129-0429

  We have investigated the intrabinary shock emission from the redback
millisecond pulsar PSR J2129-0429 with XMM-Newton and Fermi. Orbital modulation
in X-ray and UV can be clearly seen. Its X-ray modulation has a double-peak
structure with a dip in between. The observed X-rays are non-thermal dominant
which can be modeled by a power-law with a photon index of ~1.2. Intrabinary
shock can be the origin of the observed X-rays. The UV light curve is resulted
from the ellipsoidal modulation of the companion. Modeling the UV light curve
prefers a large viewing angle. The heating effect of the UV light curve is
found to be negligible which suggests the high energy radiation beam of PSR
J2129-0429 does not direct toward its companion. On the other hand, no
significant orbital modulation can be found in gamma-ray which suggests the
majority of the gamma-rays come from the pulsar.


A Wide-Field HI Study of the NGC 1566 Group

  We report on neutral hydrogen observations of a ~ 5.5 x 5.5 degree field
around the NGC 1566 galaxy group with the multibeam narrow-band system on the
64-m Parkes telescope. We detected thirteen HI sources in the field, including
two galaxies not previously known to be members of the group, bringing the
total number of confirmed galaxies in this group to 26. Each of the HI galaxies
can be associated with an optically catalogued galaxy. No 'intergalactic HI
clouds' were found to an HI mass limit of ~ 3.5 x 10^8 Msun. We have estimated
the expected HI content of the late-type galaxies in this group and find the
total detected HI is consistent with our expectations. However, while no global
HI deficiency is inferred for this group, two galaxies exhibit individual HI
deficiencies. Further observations are needed to determine the gas removal
mechanisms in these galaxies.


Signatures of Molecular Magnetism in Single-Molecule Transport
  Spectroscopy

  Single-molecule transistors provide a unique experimental tool to investigate
the coupling between charge transport and the molecular degrees of freedom in
individual molecules. One interesting class of molecules for such experiments
are the single-molecule magnets, since the intramolecular exchange forces
present in these molecules should couple strongly to the spin of transport
electrons, thereby providing both new mechanisms for modulating electron flow
and also new means for probing nanoscale magnetic excitations. Here we report
single-molecule transistor measurements on devices incorporating Mn12
molecules. By studying the electron-tunneling spectrum as a function of
magnetic field, we are able to identify clear signatures of magnetic states and
their associated magnetic anisotropy. A comparison of the data to simulations
also suggests that electron flow can strongly enhance magnetic relaxation of
the magnetic molecule.


Minimal Economic Distributed Computing

  In an ideal distributed computing infrastructure, users would be able to use
diverse distributed computing resources in a simple coherent way, with
guaranteed security and efficient use of shared resources in accordance with
the wishes of the owners of the resources. Our strategy for approaching this
ideal is to first find the simplest structure within which these goals can
plausibly be achieved. This structure, we find, is given by a particular
recursive distributive lattice freely constructed from a presumed partially
ordered set of all data in the infrastructure. Minor syntactic adjustments to
the resulting algebra yields a simple language resembling a UNIX shell, a
concept of execution and an interprocess protocol. Persons, organizations and
servers within the system express their interests explicitly via a hierarchical
currency. The currency provides a common framework for treating authentication,
access control and resource sharing as economic problems while also introducing
a new dimension for improving the infrastructure over time by designing system
components which compete with each other to earn the currency. We explain these
results, discuss experience with an implementation called egg and point out
areas where more research is needed.


Fermi Surface of Alpha-Uranium at Ambient Pressure

  We have performed de Haas-van Alphen measurements of the Fermi surface of
alpha-uranium single crystals at ambient pressure within the alpha-3 charge
density wave (CDW) state from 0.020 K - 10 K and magnetic fields to 35 T using
torque magnetometry. The angular dependence of the resulting frequencies is
described. Effective masses were measured and the Dingle temperature was
determined to be 0.74 K +/- 0.04 K. The observation of quantum oscillations
within the alpha-3 CDW state gives new insight into the effect of the charge
density waves on the Fermi surface. In addition we observed no signature of
superconductivity in either transport or magnetization down to 0.020 K
indicating the possibility of a pressure-induced quantum critical point that
separates the superconducting dome from the normal CDW phase.


The Membership and Distance of the Open Cluster Collinder 419

  The young open cluster Collinder 419 surrounds the massive O star, HD 193322,
that is itself a remarkable multiple star system containing at least four
components. Here we present a discussion of the cluster distance based upon new
spectral classifications of the brighter members, UBV photometry, and an
analysis of astrometric and photometric data from the UCAC3 and 2MASS catalogs.
We determine an average cluster reddening of E(B-V)=0.37 +- 0.05 mag and a
cluster distance of 741 +- 36 pc. The cluster probably contains some very young
stars that may include a reddened M3 III star, IRAS~20161+4035.


Simplicity-Expressiveness Tradeoffs in Mechanism Design

  A fundamental result in mechanism design theory, the so-called revelation
principle, asserts that for many questions concerning the existence of
mechanisms with a given outcome one can restrict attention to truthful direct
revelation-mechanisms. In practice, however, many mechanism use a restricted
message space. This motivates the study of the tradeoffs involved in choosing
simplified mechanisms, which can sometimes bring benefits in precluding bad or
promoting good equilibria, and other times impose costs on welfare and revenue.
We study the simplicity-expressiveness tradeoff in two representative settings,
sponsored search auctions and combinatorial auctions, each being a canonical
example for complete information and incomplete information analysis,
respectively. We observe that the amount of information available to the agents
plays an important role for the tradeoff between simplicity and expressiveness.


Quantifying the Strategyproofness of Mechanisms via Metrics on Payoff
  Distributions

  Strategyproof mechanisms provide robust equilibrium with minimal assumptions
about knowledge and rationality but can be unachievable in combination with
other desirable properties such as budget-balance, stability against deviations
by coalitions, and computational tractability. In the search for
maximally-strategyproof mechanisms that simultaneously satisfy other desirable
properties, we introduce a new metric to quantify the strategyproofness of a
mechanism, based on comparing the payoff distribution, given truthful reports,
against that of a strategyproof "reference" mechanism that solves a problem
relaxation. Focusing on combinatorial exchanges, we demonstrate that the metric
is informative about the eventual equilibrium, where simple regretbased metrics
are not, and can be used for online selection of an effective mechanism.


Random Utility Theory for Social Choice

  Random utility theory models an agent's preferences on alternatives by
drawing a real-valued score on each alternative (typically independently) from
a parameterized distribution, and then ranking the alternatives according to
scores. A special case that has received significant attention is the
Plackett-Luce model, for which fast inference methods for maximum likelihood
estimators are available. This paper develops conditions on general random
utility models that enable fast inference within a Bayesian framework through
MC-EM, providing concave loglikelihood functions and bounded sets of global
maxima solutions. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support
for the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection among
general random utility models including Plackett-Luce.


Truthful Prioritization Schemes for Spectrum Sharing

  We design a protocol for dynamic prioritization of data on shared routers
such as untethered 3G/4G devices. The mechanism prioritizes bandwidth in favor
of users with the highest value, and is incentive compatible, so that users can
simply report their true values for network access. A revenue pooling mechanism
also aligns incentives for sellers, so that they will choose to use
prioritization methods that retain the incentive properties on the buy-side. In
this way, the design allows for an open architecture. In addition to revenue
pooling, the technical contribution is to identify a class of stochastic demand
models and a prioritization scheme that provides allocation monotonicity.
Simulation results confirm efficiency gains from dynamic prioritization
relative to prior methods, as well as the effectiveness of revenue pooling.


Models for Truthful Online Double Auctions

  Online double auctions (DAs) model a dynamic two-sided matching problem with
private information and self-interest, and are relevant for dynamic resource
and task allocation problems. We present a general method to design truthful
DAs, such that no agent can benefit from misreporting its arrival time,
duration, or value. The family of DAs is parameterized by a pricing rule, and
includes a generalization of McAfee's truthful DA to this dynamic setting. We
present an empirical study, in which we study the allocative-surplus and agent
surplus for a number of different DAs. Our results illustrate that dynamic
pricing rules are important to provide good market efficiency for markets with
high volatility or low volume.


Payment Rules through Discriminant-Based Classifiers

  In mechanism design it is typical to impose incentive compatibility and then
derive an optimal mechanism subject to this constraint. By replacing the
incentive compatibility requirement with the goal of minimizing expected ex
post regret, we are able to adapt statistical machine learning techniques to
the design of payment rules. This computational approach to mechanism design is
applicable to domains with multi-dimensional types and situations where
computational efficiency is a concern. Specifically, given an outcome rule and
access to a type distribution, we train a support vector machine with a special
discriminant function structure such that it implicitly establishes a payment
rule with desirable incentive properties. We discuss applications to a
multi-minded combinatorial auction with a greedy winner-determination algorithm
and to an assignment problem with egalitarian outcome rule. Experimental
results demonstrate both that the construction produces payment rules with low
ex post regret, and that penalizing classification errors is effective in
preventing failures of ex post individual rationality.


Expressiveness and Robustness of First-Price Position Auctions

  Since economic mechanisms are often applied to very different instances of
the same problem, it is desirable to identify mechanisms that work well in a
wide range of circumstances. We pursue this goal for a position auction setting
and specifically seek mechanisms that guarantee good outcomes under both
complete and incomplete information. A variant of the generalized first-price
mechanism with multi-dimensional bids turns out to be the only standard
mechanism able to achieve this goal, even when types are one-dimensional. The
fact that expressiveness beyond the type space is both necessary and sufficient
for this kind of robustness provides an interesting counterpoint to previous
work on position auctions that has highlighted the benefits of simplicity. From
a technical perspective our results are interesting because they establish
equilibrium existence for a multi-dimensional bid space, where standard
techniques break down. The structure of the equilibrium bids moreover provides
an intuitive explanation for why first-price payments may be able to support
equilibria in a wider range of circumstances than second-price payments.


A Statistical Decision-Theoretic Framework for Social Choice

  In this paper, we take a statistical decision-theoretic viewpoint on social
choice, putting a focus on the decision to be made on behalf of a system of
agents. In our framework, we are given a statistical ranking model, a decision
space, and a loss function defined on (parameter, decision) pairs, and
formulate social choice mechanisms as decision rules that minimize expected
loss. This suggests a general framework for the design and analysis of new
social choice mechanisms. We compare Bayesian estimators, which minimize
Bayesian expected loss, for the Mallows model and the Condorcet model
respectively, and the Kemeny rule. We consider various normative properties, in
addition to computational complexity and asymptotic behavior. In particular, we
show that the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model satisfies some desired
properties such as anonymity, neutrality, and monotonicity, can be computed in
polynomial time, and is asymptotically different from the other two rules when
the data are generated from the Condorcet model for some ground truth
parameter.


Capturing Variation and Uncertainty in Human Judgment

  The well-studied problem of statistical rank aggregation has been applied to
comparing sports teams, information retrieval, and most recently to data
generated by human judgment. Such human-generated rankings may be substantially
different from traditional statistical ranking data. In this work, we show that
a recently proposed generalized random utility model reveals distinctive
patterns in human judgment across three different domains, and provides a
succinct representation of variance in both population preferences and
imperfect perception. In contrast, we also show that classical statistical
ranking models fail to capture important features from human-generated input.
Our work motivates the use of more flexible ranking models for representing and
describing the collective preferences or decision-making of human participants.


Atomically-thin Ohmic Edge Contacts Between Two-dimensional Materials

  With the decrease of the dimensions of electronic devices, the role played by
electrical contacts is ever increasing, eventually coming to dominate the
overall device volume and total resistance. This is especially problematic for
monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which are
promising candidates for atomically thin electronics. Ideal electrical contacts
to them would require the use of similarly thin electrode materials while
maintaining low contact resistances. Here we report a scalable method to
fabricate ohmic graphene edge contacts to two representative monolayer TMDs -
MoS2 and WS2. The graphene and TMD layer are laterally connected with
wafer-scale homogeneity, no observable overlap or gap, and a low average
contact resistance of 30 k$\Omega$ $\mu$m. The resulting graphene edge contacts
show linear current-voltage (IV) characteristics at room temperature, with
ohmic behavior maintained down to liquid helium temperatures.


Learning and Solving Many-Player Games through a Cluster-Based
  Representation

  In addressing the challenge of exponential scaling with the number of agents
we adopt a cluster-based representation to approximately solve asymmetric games
of very many players. A cluster groups together agents with a similar
"strategic view" of the game. We learn the clustered approximation from data
consisting of strategy profiles and payoffs, which may be obtained from
observations of play or access to a simulator. Using our clustering we
construct a reduced "twins" game in which each cluster is associated with two
players of the reduced game. This allows our representation to be individually-
responsive because we align the interests of every individual agent with the
strategy of its cluster. Our approach provides agents with higher payoffs and
lower regret on average than model-free methods as well as previous
cluster-based methods, and requires only few observations for learning to be
successful. The "twins" approach is shown to be an important component of
providing these low regret approximations.


Optimal Coordinated Planning Amongst Self-Interested Agents with Private
  State

  Consider a multi-agent system in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Each
agent's local decision problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)
and agents must coordinate on a joint action in each period, which provides a
reward to each agent and causes local state transitions. A social planner knows
the model of every agent's MDP and wants to implement the optimal joint policy,
but agents are self-interested and have private local state. We provide an
incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting state information that achieves
the optimal joint plan in a Markov perfect equilibrium of the induced
stochastic game. In the special case in which local problems are Markov chains
and agents compete to take a single action in each period, we leverage Gittins
allocation indices to provide an efficient factored algorithm and distribute
computation of the optimal policy among the agents. Distributed, optimal
coordinated learning in a multi-agent variant of the multi-armed bandit problem
is obtained as a special case.


Miniature Dilatometer Based upon an AFM Piezocantilever

  We report on the development of a sensitive dilatometer based upon a AFM
piezocantilever. This dilatometer has been tested at temperatures down to 25 mK
and in magnetic fields up to 16 T. The layered heavy fermion superconductor
$CeCoIn_5$ and its non-magnetic analog $LaRhIn_5$ have been measured to
demonstrate its use in detecting phase transitions and quantum oscillations. In
addition, using this dilatometer, a simultaneous multi-axis dilation
measurement has been done. This compact dilatometer has many advantages such as
its ability to measure very small samples with lengths at sub-mm levels, low
temperature and field dependence, ability to rotate, and works well
irrespective of being in a changing liquid or gas environment (i.e. within a
flow cryostat or mixing chamber).


Preference Elicitation For General Random Utility Models

  This paper discusses {General Random Utility Models (GRUMs)}. These are a
class of parametric models that generate partial ranks over alternatives given
attributes of agents and alternatives. We propose two preference elicitation
scheme for GRUMs developed from principles in Bayesian experimental design, one
for social choice and the other for personalized choice. We couple this with a
general Monte-Carlo-Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) based algorithm for MAP
inference under GRUMs. We also prove uni-modality of the likelihood functions
for a class of GRUMs. We examine the performance of various criteria by
experimental studies, which show that the proposed elicitation scheme increases
the precision of estimation.


Peer Prediction with Heterogeneous Tasks

  Peer prediction is a method to promote contributions of information by users
in settings in which there is no way to verify the quality of responses. In
multi-task peer prediction, the reports from users across multiple tasks are
used to score contributions. This paper extends the correlated agreement (CA)
multi-task peer prediction mechanism to allow the reports from users to be on
heterogeneous tasks, each associated with different distributions on responses.
The motivation comes from wanting to elicit user-generated content about places
in a city, where tasks vary because places, and questions about places, vary.
We prove that the generalized CA mechanism is informed truthful under weak
conditions, meaning that it is strictly beneficial for a user to invest effort
and acquire information, and that truthful reporting is the best strategy when
investing effort, as well as an equilibrium. We demonstrate that the mechanism
has good incentive properties when tested in simulation on distributions
derived from user reports on Google Local Guides.


IOTA (Integrable Optics Test Accelerator): Facility and Experimental
  Beam Physics Program

  The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is a storage ring for advanced
beam physics research currently being built and commissioned at Fermilab. It
will operate with protons and electrons using injectors with momenta of 70 and
150 MeV/c, respectively. The research program includes the study of nonlinear
focusing integrable optical beam lattices based on special magnets and electron
lenses, beam dynamics of space-charge effects and their compensation, optical
stochastic cooling, and several other experiments. In this article, we present
the design and main parameters of the facility, outline progress to date and
provide the timeline of the construction, commissioning and research. The
physical principles, design, and hardware implementation plans for the major
IOTA experiments are also discussed.


Optimal Auctions through Deep Learning

  Designing an incentive compatible auction that maximizes expected revenue is
an intricate task. The single-item case was resolved in a seminal piece of work
by Myerson in 1981. Even after 30-40 years of intense research the problem
remains unsolved for seemingly simple multi-bidder, multi-item settings. In
this work, we initiate the exploration of the use of tools from deep learning
for the automated design of optimal auctions. We model an auction as a
multi-layer neural network, frame optimal auction design as a constrained
learning problem, and show how it can be solved using standard pipelines. We
prove generalization bounds and present extensive experiments, recovering
essentially all known analytical solutions for multi-item settings, and
obtaining novel mechanisms for settings in which the optimal mechanism is
unknown.


Calibrated Fairness in Bandits

  We study fairness within the stochastic, \emph{multi-armed bandit} (MAB)
decision making framework. We adapt the fairness framework of "treating similar
individuals similarly" to this setting. Here, an `individual' corresponds to an
arm and two arms are `similar' if they have a similar quality distribution.
First, we adopt a {\em smoothness constraint} that if two arms have a similar
quality distribution then the probability of selecting each arm should be
similar. In addition, we define the {\em fairness regret}, which corresponds to
the degree to which an algorithm is not calibrated, where perfect calibration
requires that the probability of selecting an arm is equal to the probability
with which the arm has the best quality realization. We show that a variation
on Thompson sampling satisfies smooth fairness for total variation distance,
and give an $\tilde{O}((kT)^{2/3})$ bound on fairness regret. This complements
prior work, which protects an on-average better arm from being less favored. We
also explain how to extend our algorithm to the dueling bandit setting.


Amplified Sensitivity of Nitrogen-Vacancy Spins in Nanodiamonds using
  All-Optical Charge Readout

  Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers offer a versatile
platform for sensing applications spanning from nanomagnetism to in-vivo
monitoring of cellular processes. In many cases, however, weak optical signals
and poor contrast demand long acquisition times that prevent the measurement of
environmental dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the ability to perform fast,
high-contrast optical measurements of charge distributions in ensembles of NV
centers in nanodiamonds and use the technique to improve the spin readout
signal-to-noise ratio through spin-to-charge conversion. A study of 38
nanodiamonds, each hosting 10-15 NV centers with an average diameter of 40 nm,
uncovers complex, multiple-timescale dynamics due to radiative and
non-radiative ionization and recombination processes. Nonetheless, the
nanodiamonds universally exhibit charge-dependent photoluminescence contrasts
and the potential for enhanced spin readout using spin-to-charge conversion. We
use the technique to speed up a $T_1$ relaxometry measurement by a factor of
five.


Fabrication of (111)-Faced Single-Crystal Diamond Plates by Laser
  Nucleated Cleaving

  Single-crystal diamond plates with surfaces oriented in a (111) crystal plane
are required for high-performance solid-state device platforms ranging from
power electronics to quantum information processing architectures. However,
producing plates with this orientation has proven challenging. In this paper,
we demonstrate a method for reliably and precisely fabricating (111)-faced
plates from commercially available, chemical-vapor-deposition-grown, type-IIa
single-crystal diamond substrates with (100) faces. Our method uses a
nanosecond-pulsed visible laser to nucleate and propagate a mechanical cleave
in a chosen (111) crystal plane, resulting in faces as large as 3.0
mm$\times$0.3 mm with atomically flat surfaces, negligible miscut angles, and
near zero kerf loss. We discuss the underlying physical mechanisms of the
process along with potential improvements that will enable the production of
millimeter-scale (111)-faced single-crystal diamond plates for a variety of
emerging devices and applications.


Spatio-Temporal Pricing for Ridesharing Platforms

  Ridesharing platforms match drivers and riders to trips, using dynamic prices
to balance supply and demand. A challenge is to set prices that are
appropriately smooth in space and time, so that drivers will choose to accept
their dispatched trips, rather than drive to another area or wait for higher
prices or a better trip. We work in a complete information, discrete time,
multi-period, multi-location model, and introduce the Spatio-Temporal Pricing
(STP) mechanism. The mechanism is incentive-aligned, in that it is a
subgame-perfect equilibrium for drivers to accept their dispatches. The
mechanism is also welfare-optimal, envy-free, individually rational, budget
balanced and core-selecting from any history onward. The proof of incentive
alignment makes use of the $M^\natural$ concavity of min-cost flow objectives.
We also give an impossibility result, that there can be no dominant-strategy
mechanism with the same economic properties. An empirical analysis conducted in
simulation suggests that the STP mechanism can achieve significantly higher
social welfare than a myopic pricing mechanism.


Optimizing cluster-based randomized experiments under a monotonicity
  assumption

  Cluster-based randomized experiments are popular designs for mitigating the
bias of standard estimators when interference is present and classical causal
inference and experimental design assumptions (such as SUTVA or ITR) do not
hold. Without an exact knowledge of the interference structure, it can be
challenging to understand which partitioning of the experimental units is
optimal to minimize the estimation bias. In the paper, we introduce a
monotonicity condition under which a novel two-stage experimental design allows
us to determine which of two cluster-based designs yields the least biased
estimator. We then consider the setting of online advertising auctions and show
that reserve price experiments verify the monotonicity condition and the
proposed framework and methodology applies. We validate our findings on an
advertising auction dataset.


Social Choice with Non Quasi-linear Utilities

  Without monetary payments, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem proves that
under mild requirements all truthful social choice mechanisms must be
dictatorships. When payments are allowed, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
mechanism implements the value-maximizing choice, and has many other good
properties: it is strategy-proof, onto, deterministic, individually rational,
and does not make positive transfers to the agents. By Roberts' theorem, with
three or more alternatives, the weighted VCG mechanisms are essentially unique
for domains with quasi-linear utilities. The goal of this paper is to
characterize domains of non-quasi-linear utilities where "reasonable"
mechanisms (with VCG-like properties) exist. Our main result is a tight
characterization of the maximal non quasi-linear utility domain, which we call
the largest parallel domain. We extend Roberts' theorem to parallel domains,
and use the generalized theorem to prove two impossibility results. First, any
reasonable mechanism must be dictatorial when the utility domain is
quasi-linear together with any single non-parallel type. Second, for richer
utility domains that still differ very slightly from quasi-linearity, every
strategy-proof, onto and deterministic mechanism must be a dictatorship.


The Capacity Constrained Facility Location problem

  We initiate the study of the capacity constrained facility location problem
from a mechanism design perspective. The capacity constrained setting leads to
a new strategic environment where a facility serves a subset of the population,
which is endogenously determined by the ex-post Nash equilibrium of an induced
subgame and is not directly controlled by the mechanism designer. Our focus is
on mechanisms that are ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DIC) at
the reporting stage. We provide a complete characterization of DIC mechanisms
via the family of Generalized Median Mechanisms (GMMs). In general, the social
welfare optimal mechanism is not DIC. Adopting the worst-case approximation
measure, we attain tight lower bounds on the approximation ratio of any DIC
mechanism. The well-known median mechanism is shown to be optimal among the
family of DIC mechanisms for certain capacity ranges. Surprisingly, the
framework we introduce provides a new characterization for the family of GMMs,
and is responsive to gaps in the current social choice literature highlighted
by Border and Jordan (1983) and Barbar{\`a}, Mass{\'o} and Serizawa (1998).


Artificial Intelligence for Social Good

  The Computing Community Consortium (CCC), along with the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the Association for the
Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), co-sponsored a public workshop
on Artificial Intelligence for Social Good on June 7th, 2016 in Washington, DC.
This was one of five workshops that OSTP co-sponsored and held around the
country to spur public dialogue on artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and to identify challenges and opportunities related to AI. In the AI for
Social Good workshop, the successful deployments and the potential use of AI in
various topics that are essential for social good were discussed, including but
not limited to urban computing, health, environmental sustainability, and
public welfare. This report highlights each of these as well as a number of
crosscutting issues.


Photoresponse of a strongly correlated material determined by scanning
  photocurrent microscopy

  The generation of a current by light is a key process in optoelectronic and
photovoltaic devices. In band semiconductors, depletion fields associated with
interfaces separate long-lived photo-induced carriers. However, in systems with
strong electron-electron and electron-phonon correlations it is unclear what
physics will dominate the photoresponse. Here we investigate photocurrent in a
vanadium dioxide, an exemplary strongly correlated material known for its
dramatic metal-insulator transition (MIT) at Tc = 68 C which could be useful
for optoelectronic detection and switching up to ultraviolet wavelengths. Using
scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) on individual suspended VO2 nanobeams
we observe photoresponse peaked at the metal-insulator boundary but extended
throughout both insulating and metallic phases. We determine that the response
is photo-thermal, implying efficient carrier relaxation to a local equilibrium
in a manner consistent with strong correlations. Temperature dependent
measurements reveal subtle phase changes within the insulating state. We
further demonstrate switching of the photocurrent by optical control of the
metal-insulator boundary arrangement. Our work shows the value of SPCM applied
to nanoscale crystals for investigating strongly correlated materials, and the
results are relevant for designing and controlling optoelectronic devices
employing such materials.


Measurement of a solid-state triple point at the metal-insulator
  transition in VO2

  First-order phase transitions in solids are notoriously challenging to study.
The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion,
and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain
structure, hysteresis, and cracking. The situation is still worse near a triple
point where more than two phases are involved. The famous metal-insulator
transition (MIT) in vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast optical
and electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is
one of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties
posed by the first-order nature of the MIT as well as the involvement of at
least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy about
its nature. Here, we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in a
purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this
prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our
results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic and
two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, T_tr = T_c, which we
determine to be 65.0 +- 0.1 C. The findings have profound implications for the
mechanism of the MIT in VO2, but in addition they demonstrate the importance of
such an approach for mastering phase transitions in many other strongly
correlated materials, such as manganites and iron-based superconductors.


ALMA Multi-line Imaging of the Nearby Starburst Galaxy NGC 253

  We present spatially resolved ($\sim$50 pc) imaging of molecular gas species
in the central kiloparsec of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, based on
observations taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA). A total of 50 molecular lines are detected over a 13 GHz bandwidth
imaged in the 3 mm band. Unambiguous identifications are assigned for 27 lines.
Based on the measured high CO/C$^{17}$O isotopic line ratio ($\gtrsim$350), we
show that $^{12}$CO(1-0) has moderate optical depths. A comparison of the HCN
and HCO$^{+}$ with their $^{13}$C-substituted isotopologues shows that the
HCN(1-0) and HCO$^{+}$(1-0) lines have optical depths at least comparable to
CO(1-0). H$^{13}$CN/H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (and H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C) line ratios
provide tighter constraints on dense gas properties in this starburst. SiO has
elevated abundances across the nucleus. HNCO has the most distinctive
morphology of all the bright lines, with its global luminosity dominated by the
outer parts of the central region. The dramatic variation seen in the HNCO/SiO
line ratio suggests that some of the chemical signatures of shocked gas are
being erased in the presence of dominating central radiation fields (traced by
C$_{2}$H and CN). High density molecular gas tracers (including HCN, HCO$^+$,
and CN) are detected at the base of the molecular outflow. We also detect
hydrogen $\beta$ recombination lines that, like their $\alpha$ counterparts,
show compact, centrally peaked morphologies, distinct from the molecular gas
tracers. A number of sulfur based species are mapped (CS, SO, NS, C$_{2}$S,
H$_{2}$CS and CH$_{3}$SH) and have morphologies similar to SiO.


Bulk properties of van-der-Waals hard ferromagnet VI3

  We present comprehensive measurements of the structural, magnetic and
electronic properties of layered van-der-Waals ferromagnet VI$_3$ down to low
temperatures. Despite belonging to a well studied family of transition metal
trihalides, this material has received very little attention. We outline, from
high-resolution powder x-ray diffraction measurements, a corrected
room-temperature crystal structure to that previously proposed and uncover a
structural transition at 79 K, also seen in the heat capacity. Magnetization
measurements confirm VI$_3$ to be a hard ferromagnet (9.1 kOe coercive field at
2 K) with a high degree of anisotropy, and the pressure dependence of the
magnetic properties provide evidence for the two-dimensional nature of the
magnetic order. Optical and electrical transport measurements show this
material to be an insulator with an optical band gap of 0.67 eV - the previous
theoretical predictions of d-band metallicity then lead us to believe VI$_3$ to
be a correlated Mott insulator. Our latest band structure calculations support
this picture and show good agreement with the experimental data. We suggest
VI$_3$ to host great potential in the thriving field of low-dimensional
magnetism and functional materials, together with opportunities to study and
make use of low-dimensional Mott physics.


Measurement of the generalized form factors near threshold via $γ^*
  p \to nπ^+$ at high $Q^2$

  We report the first extraction of the pion-nucleon multipoles near the
production threshold for the $n\pi^+$ channel at relatively high momentum
transfer ($Q^2$ up to 4.2 $\rm{GeV^2}$). The dominance of the s-wave transverse
multipole ($E_{0+}$), expected in this region, allowed us to access the
generalized form factor $G_1$ within the light-cone sum rule (LCSR) framework
as well as the axial form factor $G_A$. The data analyzed in this work were
collected by the nearly $4\pi$ CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) using
a 5.754 $\rm{GeV}$ electron beam on a proton target. The differential cross
section and the $\pi-N$-multipole $E_{0+}/G_D$ were measured using two
different methods, the LCSR and a direct multipole fit. The results from the
two methods are found to be consistent and almost $Q^2$ independent.


Searches for millisecond pulsar candidates among the unidentified Fermi
  objects

  Here we report the results of searching millisecond pulsar (MSP) candidates
from the Fermi LAT second source catalog (2FGL). Seven unassociated
$\gamma-$ray sources in this catalog are identified as promising MSP candidates
based on their $\gamma$-ray properties. Through the X-ray analysis, we have
detected possible X-ray counterparts, localized to an arcsecond accuracy. We
have systematically estimated their X-ray fluxes and compared with the
corresponding $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The X-ray to $\gamma$-ray flux ratios for
2FGL J1653.6-0159 and 2FGL J1946.4-5402 are comparable with the typical value
for pulsars. For 2FGL J1625.2-0020, 2FGL J1653.6-0159 and 2FGL J1946.4-5402,
their candidate X-ray counterparts are bright enough for performing a detailed
spectral and temporal analysis to discriminate their thermal/non thermal nature
and search for the periodic signal. We have also searched for possible
optical/IR counterparts at the X-ray positions. For the optical/IR source
coincident with the brightest X-ray object that associated with 2FGL
J1120.0-2204, its spectral energy distribution is comparable with a late-type
star. Evidence for the variability has also been found by examining its optical
light curve. All the aforementioned 2FGL sources resemble a pulsar in one or
more aspects, which make them as the promising targets for follow-up
investigations.


The Galaxy Proximity Effect in the Lyman-alpha Forest

  Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations predict that the average opacity of the
Ly-alpha forest should increase in the neighborhood of galaxies because
galaxies form in dense environments. Recent observations (Adelberger et al.
2002) confirm this expectation at large scales, but they show a decrease of
absorption at comoving separations Delta_r <~ 1 Mpc/h. We show that this
discrepancy is statistically significant, especially for the innermost data
point at Delta_r <= 0.5 Mpc/h, even though this data point rests on three
galaxy-quasar pairs. Galaxy redshift errors of the expected magnitude are
insufficient to resolve the conflict. Peculiar velocities allow gas at comoving
distances >~ 1 Mpc/h to produce saturated absorption at the galaxy redshift,
putting stringent requirements on any ``feedback'' solution. Local
photoionization is insufficient, even if we allow for recurrent AGN activity
that keeps the neutral hydrogen fraction below its equilibrium value. A simple
``wind'' model that eliminates all neutral hydrogen in spheres around the
observed galaxies can marginally explain the data, but only if the winds extend
to comoving radii ~1.5 Mpc/h.


An HI census of Loose Groups of Galaxies

  We present results from our Parkes Multibeam HI survey of 3 loose groups of
galaxies that are analogous to the Local Group. This is a survey of groups
containing only spiral galaxies with mean separations of a few hundred kpc, and
total areas of approximately 1 sq. Mpc; groups similar to our own Local Group.
We present a census of the HI-rich objects in these groups down to an M(HI),
1-sigma sensitivity ~7x10^5 M(sun), as well as the detailed properties of these
detections from follow-up Compact Array observations. We found 7 new HI-rich
members in the 3 groups, all of which have stellar counterparts and are,
therefore, typical dwarf galaxies. The ratio of low-mass to high-mass gas-rich
galaxies in these groups is less than in the Local Group meaning that the
``missing satellite'' problem is not unique. No high-velocity cloud analogs
were found in any of the groups. If HVCs in these groups are the same as in the
Local Group, this implies that HVCs must be located within ~300-400 kpc of the
Milky Way.


NR/HEP: roadmap for the future

  Physics in curved spacetime describes a multitude of phenomena, ranging from
astrophysics to high energy physics. The last few years have witnessed further
progress on several fronts, including the accurate numerical evolution of the
gravitational field equations, which now allows highly nonlinear phenomena to
be tamed. Numerical relativity simulations, originally developed to understand
strong field astrophysical processes, could prove extremely useful to
understand high-energy physics processes like trans-Planckian scattering and
gauge-gravity dualities. We present a concise and comprehensive overview of the
state-of-the-art and important open problems in the field(s), along with
guidelines for the next years. This writeup is a summary of the "NR/HEP
Workshop" held in Madeira, Portugal from August 31st to September 3rd 2011.


Long-term causal effects of economic mechanisms on agent incentives

  Economic mechanisms administer the allocation of resources to interested
agents based on their self-reported types. One objective in mechanism design is
to design a strategyproof process so that no agent will have an incentive to
misreport its type. However, typical analyses of the incentives properties of
mechanisms operate under strong, usually untestable assumptions. Empirical,
data-oriented approaches are, at best, under-developed. Furthermore,
mechanism/policy evaluation methods usually ignore the dynamic nature of a
multi-agent system and are thus inappropriate for estimating long-term effects.
We introduce the problem of estimating the causal effects of mechanisms on
incentives and frame it under the Rubin causal framework \citep{rubin74,
rubin78}. This raises unique technical challenges since the outcome of interest
(agent truthfulness) is confounded with strategic interactions and,
interestingly, is typically never observed under any mechanism. We develop a
methodology to estimate such causal effects that using a prior that is based on
a strategic equilibrium model. Working on the domain of kidney exchanges, we
show how to apply our methodology to estimate causal effects of kidney
allocation mechanisms on hospitals' incentives. Our results demonstrate that
the use of game-theoretic prior captures the dynamic nature of the kidney
exchange multiagent system and shrinks the estimates towards long-term effects,
thus improving upon typical methods that completely ignore agents' strategic
behavior.


Inhomogeneity in the ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition dynamics in
  VO$_2$

  The insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) of the simple binary compound of
vanadium dioxide VO$_2$ at $\sim 340$ K has been puzzling since its discovery
more than five decades ago. A wide variety of photon and electron probes have
been applied in search of a satisfactory microscopic mechanistic explanation.
However, many of the conclusions drawn have implicitly assumed a {\em
homogeneous} material response. Here, we reveal inherently {\em inhomogeneous}
behavior in the study of the dynamics of individual VO$_2$ micro-crystals using
a combination of femtosecond pump-probe microscopy with nano-IR imaging. The
time scales of the photoinduced bandgap reorganization in the ultrafast IMT
vary from $\simeq 40 \pm 8$ fs, i.e., shorter than a suggested phonon
bottleneck, to $\sim 200\pm20$ fs, with an average value of $80 \pm 25$ fs,
similar to results from previous studies on polycrystalline thin films. The
variation is uncorrelated with crystal size, orientation, transition
temperature, and initial insulating phase. This together with details of the
nano-domain behavior during the thermally-induced IMT suggests a significant
sensitivity to local variations in, e.g., doping, defects, and strain of the
microcrystals. The combination of results points to an electronic mechanism
dominating the photoinduced IMT in VO$_2$, but also highlights the difficulty
of deducing mechanistic information where the intrinsic response in correlated
matter may not yet have been reached.
