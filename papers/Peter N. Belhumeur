Stochastic Dynamics for Video Infilling

  In this paper, we introduce a stochastic generation framework (SDVI) toinfill long intervals in video sequences. To enhance the temporal resolution,video interpolation aims to produce transitional frames for a short intervalbetween every two frames. Video Infilling, however, aims to complete longintervals in a video sequence. Our framework models the infilling as aconstrained stochastic generation process and sequentially samples dynamicsfrom the inferred distribution. SDVI consists of two parts: (1) abi-directional constraint propagation to guarantee the spatial-temporalcoherency among frames, (2) a stochastic sampling process to generate dynamicsfrom the inferred distributions. Experimental results show that SDVI cangenerate clear and varied sequences. Moreover, motions in the generatedsequence are realistic and able to transfer smoothly from the referenced startframe to the end frame.
