Stochastic Dynamics for Video Infilling

  In this paper, we introduce a stochastic generation framework (SDVI) to
infill long intervals in video sequences. To enhance the temporal resolution,
video interpolation aims to produce transitional frames for a short interval
between every two frames. Video Infilling, however, aims to complete long
intervals in a video sequence. Our framework models the infilling as a
constrained stochastic generation process and sequentially samples dynamics
from the inferred distribution. SDVI consists of two parts: (1) a
bi-directional constraint propagation to guarantee the spatial-temporal
coherency among frames, (2) a stochastic sampling process to generate dynamics
from the inferred distributions. Experimental results show that SDVI can
generate clear and varied sequences. Moreover, motions in the generated
sequence are realistic and able to transfer smoothly from the referenced start
frame to the end frame.
