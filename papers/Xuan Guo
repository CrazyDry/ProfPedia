Suppression of leakage for a charge quadrupole qubit in triangular  geometry

  We present a simple yet effective strategy to suppress the leakage in thecharge quadrupole qubit system by having the dots in a triangle as opposed tothe linear geometry originally conceived. We find that the tunnel couplingbetween the two outmost dots are amplified in triangular triple dots, whichconsequently reduces leakage by separating the leaked state and qubit states.We have found that the leakage can be suppressed by as much as five orders ofmagnitude when the dots form an equilateral triangle, with further improvementof control fidelities possible if composite pulses are applied.

Decentralizing MVCC by Leveraging Visibility

  Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) is a widely adopted concurrencycontrol mechanism in database systems, which usually utilizes timestamps toresolve conflicts between transactions. However, centralized allocation oftimestamps is a potential bottleneck for parallel transaction management. Thisbottleneck is becoming increasingly visible with the rapidly growing degree ofparallelism of today's computing platforms. This paper introduces Visibilitybased Concurrency Control (ViCC), a series of CC mechanisms that allowtransactions to determine their timestamps autonomously, without relying oncentralized coordination. As such, ViCC can scale well, rendering it suitablefor various multicore and MPP platforms. Extensive experiments are conducted todemonstrate its advantage over existing approaches.

Nematicons in liquid crystals with negative dielectric anisotropy

  We report a theoretical and experimental work on the nematicon in the planarcell containing the nematic liquid crystal with negative dielectric anisotropy,aligned homeotropically in the presence of an externally applied voltage. Theformation of the soliton is resulted from the balance between the lineardifrraction and the nonlocal nonlinearity due to molecular reorientation.

A Moser type inequality for Bessel Laplace equations and applications

  In this paper, we study Bessel operators and Bessel Laplace equations studiedby Weinstein, Huber, and related the harmonic function theory introduced byMuckenhoupt--Stein. We establish the Moser type inequality for these harmonicfunctions, which is missing in this setting before. We then apply it to give adirect proof for the equivalence of characterizations of the Hardy spacesassociated to Bessel operator via non-tangential maximal function and radialmaximal function defined in terms of the Poisson semigroup.

Polarization sensitive laser intensity inside femtosecond filament in  air

  Polarization dependence on clamping intensity inside femtosecond filament wasexperimentally measured in air. By tuning the laser pulse ellipse from linearpolarization to circular polarization, the measured clamping intensity insidelaser filament is gradually increased up to 1.7 times. The experimental resultsare in good agreement with the simulation results by solving the extendednonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). The polarization sensitive clampingintensity inside filaments offers an important factor towards fullyunderstanding the polarization related phenomenon observed so far.

JS-MA: A Jensen-Shannon Divergence Based Method for Mapping Genome-wide  Associations on Multiple Diseases

  Taking advantages of high-throughput genotyping technology of singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP), large genome-wide association studies (GWASs)have been considered as the promise to unravel the complex relationshipsbetween genotypes and phenotypes, in particularly common diseases. However,current multi-locus-based methods are insufficient, in terms of computationalcost and discrimination power, to detect statistically significant interactionsand they are lacking in the ability of finding diverse genetic effects onmultifarious diseases. Especially, multiple statistic tests for high-orderepistasis ($ \geq $ 2 SNPs) will raise huge analytical challenges because thecomputational cost increases exponentially as the growth of the cardinality ofSNPs in an epistatic module. In this paper, we develop a simple, fast andpowerful method, named JS-MA, using the Jensen-Shannon divergence and ahigh-dimensional $ k $-mean clustering algorithm for mapping the genome-widemulti-locus epistatic interactions on multiple diseases. Compared with somestate-of-the-art association mapping tools, our method is demonstrated to bemore powerful and efficient from the experimental results on the systematicalsimulations. We also applied JS-MA to the GWAS datasets from WTCCC for twocommon diseases, i.e. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Type 1 Diabetes. JS-MA not onlyconfirms some recently reported biologically meaningful associations but alsoidentifies some novel findings. Therefore, we believe that our method issuitable and efficient for the full-scale analysis of multi-disease-relatedinteractions in the large GWASs.

Sunspots rotation and magnetic transients associated with flares in NOAA  AR 11429

  We analyze sunspots rotation and magnetic transients in NOAA AR 11429 duringtwo X-class (X5.4 and X1.3) flares using the data from the Helioseismic andMagnetic Imager on board the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory}. A large leadingsunspot with positive magnetic polarity rotated counterclockwise. As expected,the rotation was significantly affected by the two flares. The magnetictransients induced by the flares were clearly evident in the sunspots withnegative polarity. They were moving across the sunspots with speed of order$3-7\ \rm km \ s^{-1}$. Furthermore, the trend of magnetic flux evolution ofthese sunspots exhibited changes associated with the flares. These results mayshed light on the understanding of the evolution of sunspots.

Multiple structure and symmetry types in narrow temperature and magnetic  field ranges in two-dimensional Cr2Ge2Te6 crystal

  Multiple structure and symmetry types and their transformations arediscovered in quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) Cr2Ge2Te6 crystal insurprisingly very narrow temperature range of 2 K and magnetic field range of0.07 T using a homebuilt magnetic force microscope (MFM). A series of basicdomain patterns are extracted from the MFM images. Some of them seem unique to2-D materials as they are not observed in 3-D materials, such as self-fittingdisks, and fine ladder structure within Y-connected walls. Based on thesefindings, a phase map is drawn for the magnetic phase structures. The symmetryof the patterns are discussed. The results are not only important in developingnew theories but also highly desirable in applications.

Self-learning Mutual Selection Model for Weighted Networks

  In this paper, we propose a self-learning mutual selection model tocharacterize weighted evolving networks. By introducing the self-learningprobability $p$ and the general mutual selection mechanism, which is controlledby the parameter $m$, the model can reproduce scale-free distributions ofdegree, weight and strength, as found in many real systems. The simulationresults are consistent with the theoretical predictions approximately.Interestingly, we obtain the nontrivial clustering coefficient $C$ and tunabledegree assortativity $r$, depending on the parameters $m$ and $p$. The modelcan unify the characterization of both assortative and disassortative weightednetworks. Also, we find that self-learning may contribute to the assortativemixing of social networks.

Nonlocality-controlled interaction of spatial solitons in nematic liquid  crystals

  We demonstrate experimentally that the interactions between a pair ofnonlocal spatial optical solitons in a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) can becontrolled by the degree of nonlocality. For a given beam width, the degree ofnonlocality can be modulated by varying the pretilt angle of NLC molecules viathe change of the bias. When the pretilt angle is smaller than pi/4, thenonlocality is strong enough to guarantee the independence of the interactionson the phase difference of the solitons. As the pretilt angle increases, thedegree of nonlocality decreases. When the degree is below its critical value,the two solitons behavior in the way like their local counterpart: the twoin-phase solitons attract and the two out-of-phase solitons repulse.

Weighted Network of Chinese Nature Science Basic Research

  Using the requisition papers of Chinese Nature Science Basic Research inmanagement and information department, we construct the weighted network ofresearch areas({\bf WRAN}) represented by the subject codes. In WRAN, tworesearch areas are considered connected if they have been filled in at leastone requisition paper. The edge weight is defined as the number of requisitionpapers which have filled in the same pairs of codes. The node strength isdefined as the number of requisition papers which have filled in this code,including the papers which have filled in it only. Here we study a variety ofnonlocal statistics for these networks, such as typical distances betweenresearch areas through the network, and measures of centrality such asbetweenness. These statistics characteristics can illuminate the globaldevelopment trend of Chinese scientific study, it is also helpful to adjust thecode system to reflect the real status more accurately. Finally, we present aplausible model for the formation and structure of networks with the observedproperties.

Observation of Optical Solitons and Abnormal Modulation Instability in  Liquid Crystals with Negative Dielectric Anisotropy

  We investigate theoretically and experimentally the optical beam propagationin the nematic liquid crystal with negative dielectric anisotropy, which isaligned homeotropically in a $80\mu m$-thickness planar cell in the presence ofan externally voltage. It is predicted that the nonlocal nonlinearity of liquidcrystal undergo an oscillatory response function with a negative nonlinearrefractive index coefficient. We found that the oscillatory nonlocalnonlinearity can support stable bright solitons, which are observed inexperiment. We also found that abnormal modulation instability occurs withinfinity gain coefficient at a fixed spatial frequency, which is no depend onthe beam intensity. We observed the modulation instability in the liquidcrystal at a very low intensity ($0.26W/cm^2$), and the maximum gain frequencywere found kept unchange when beam power changes over 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Pentavalent symmetric graphs of order four times an odd square-free  integer

  A graph is said to be symmetric if its automorphism group is transitive onits arcs. Guo et al. (Electronic J. Combin. 18, \#P233, 2011) and Pan et al.(Electronic J. Combin. 20, \#P36, 2013) determined all pentavalent symmetricgraphs of order $4pq$. In this paper, we shall generalize this result bydetermining all connected pentavalent symmetric graphs of order four times anodd square-free integer. It is shown in this paper that, for each of suchgraphs $\it\Gamma$, either the full automorphism group ${\sf Aut}\it\Gamma$ isisomorphic to ${\sf PSL}(2,p)$, ${\sf PGL}(2,p)$, ${\sfPSL}(2,p){\times}\mathbb{Z}_2$ or ${\sf PGL}(2,p){\times}\mathbb{Z}_2$, or$\it\Gamma$ is isomorphic to one of 8 graphs.

A Learning-based Framework for Hybrid Depth-from-Defocus and Stereo  Matching

  Depth from defocus (DfD) and stereo matching are two most studied passivedepth sensing schemes. The techniques are essentially complementary: DfD canrobustly handle repetitive textures that are problematic for stereo matchingwhereas stereo matching is insensitive to defocus blurs and can handle largedepth range. In this paper, we present a unified learning-based technique toconduct hybrid DfD and stereo matching. Our input is image triplets: a stereopair and a defocused image of one of the stereo views. We first applydepth-guided light field rendering to construct a comprehensive trainingdataset for such hybrid sensing setups. Next, we adopt the hourglass networkarchitecture to separately conduct depth inference from DfD and stereo.Finally, we exploit different connection methods between the two separatenetworks for integrating them into a unified solution to produce high fidelity3D disparity maps. Comprehensive experiments on real and synthetic data showthat our new learning-based hybrid 3D sensing technique can significantlyimprove accuracy and robustness in 3D reconstruction.

On the validity of microscopic calculations of double-quantum-dot spin  qubits based on Fock-Darwin states

  We consider two typical approximations that are used in the microscopiccalculations of double-quantum dot spin qubits, namely, the Heitler-London (HL)and the Hund-Mulliken (HM) approximations, which use linear combinations ofFock-Darwin states to approximate the two-electron states under the double-wellconfinement potential. We compared these results to a case in which thesolution to a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation was exactly known andfound that typical microscopic calculations based on Fock-Darwin statessubstantially underestimate the value of the exchange interaction, which is thekey parameter that controls the quantum dot spin qubits. This underestimationoriginates from the lack of tunneling of Fock-Darwin states, which is accurateonly in the case with a single potential well. Our results suggest that theaccuracies of the current two-dimensional molecular-orbit-theoreticalcalculations based on Fock-Darwin states should be revisited sinceunderestimation could only deteriorate in dimensions that are higher than one.

Tunable charge qubit based on barrier-controlled triple quantum dots

  We present a theoretical proposal of a tunable charge qubit, hosted in triplequantum dots. The manipulation is solely performed by changing the heights ofthe two potential barriers between the three dots, while the energy of allthree dots are fixed. We have found that when the relative height of the twobarriers are changed, the direction of the axis of rotation in performingsingle-qubit gates can be varied. On the other hand, the corresponding rotationspeed can be tuned by raising or lowering the two barriers at the same time.Our proposal therefore allows for tunability of both the rotation axis androtating speed for a charge qubit via all-electrical control, which mayfacilitate realization of quantum algorithms in these devices.

Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Detection of Mind  Wandering using EEG Signals

  Mind wandering (MW) is a ubiquitous phenomenon which reflects a shift inattention from task-related to task-unrelated thoughts. There is a need forintelligent interfaces that can reorient attention when MW is detected due toits detrimental effects on performance and productivity. In this paper, wepropose a deep learning model for MW detection using Electroencephalogram (EEG)signals. Specifically, we develop a channel-wise deep convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) model to classify the features of focusing state and MW extractedfrom EEG signals. This is the first study that employs CNN to automaticallydetect MW using only EEG data. The experimental results on the collecteddataset demonstrate promising performance with 91.78% accuracy, 92.84%sensitivity, and 90.73% specificity.

A generalized theory of preferential linking

  There are diverse mechanisms driving the evolution of social networks. A keyopen question dealing with understanding their evolution is: How variouspreferential linking mechanisms produce networks with different features? Inthis paper we first empirically study preferential linking phenomena in anevolving online social network, find and validate the linear preference. Wepropose an analyzable model which captures the real growth process of thenetwork and reveals the underlying mechanism dominating its evolution.Furthermore based on preferential linking we propose a generalized modelreproducing the evolution of online social networks, present unified analyticalresults describing network characteristics for 27 preference scenarios, andexplore the relation between preferential linking mechanism and networkfeatures. We find that within the framework of preferential linking analyticaldegree distributions can only be the combinations of finite kinds of functionswhich are related to rational, logarithmic and inverse tangent functions, andextremely complex network structure will emerge even for very simple sublinearpreferential linking. This work not only provides a verifiable origin for theemergence of various network characteristics in social networks, but bridgesthe micro individuals' behaviors and the global organization of socialnetworks.

Unusual evolution of B_{c2} and T_c with inclined fields in restacked  TaS_2 nanosheets

  Recently we reported an enhanced superconductivity in restacked monolayerTaS_2 nanosheets compared with the bulk TaS_2, pointing to the exotic physicalproperties of low dimensional systems. Here we tune the superconductingproperties of this system with magnetic field along different directions, wherea strong Pauli paramagnetic spin-splitting effect is found in this system.Importantly, an unusual enhancement as high as 3.8 times of the upper criticalfield B_{c2}, as compered with the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model and Tinkhammodel, is observed under the inclined external magnetic field. Moreover, withthe out-of-plane field fixed, we find that the superconducting transitiontemperature T_c can be enhanced by increasing the in-plane field and forms adome-shaped phase diagram. An extended GL model considering the specialmicrostructure with wrinkles was proposed to describe the results. Therestacked crystal structure without inversion center along with the strongspin-orbit coupling may also play an important role for our observations.

Ground-to-satellite quantum teleportation

  An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be precisely measured or perfectlyreplicated. However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknownquantum states from one object to another over long distance, without physicaltravelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation has beenrecognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantumnetworks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previousteleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distanceon the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres orterrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for aglobal-scale "quantum internet" is to significantly extend the range forteleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satelliteplatform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote pointson the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons'propagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantumteleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory toa low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance upto 1400 km. To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmosphericturbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including acompact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beamdivergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking(APT). We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states inmutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80+/-0.01, well above theclassical limit. This work establishes the first ground-to-satellite up-linkfor faithful and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation, an essential steptoward global-scale quantum internet.
