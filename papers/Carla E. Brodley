Multi-task Learning with Weak Class Labels: Leveraging iEEG to Detect  Cortical Lesions in Cryptogenic Epilepsy

  Multi-task learning (MTL) is useful for domains in which data originates frommultiple sources that are individually under-sampled. MTL methods are able tolearn classification models that have higher performance as compared tolearning a single model by aggregating all the data together or learning aseparate model for each data source. The performance of these methods relies onlabel accuracy. We address the problem of simultaneously learning multipleclassifiers in the MTL framework when the training data has imprecise labels.We assume that there is an additional source of information that provides ascore for each instance which reflects the certainty about its label. Modelingthis score as being generated by an underlying ranking function, we augment theMTL framework with an added layer of supervision. This results in new MTLmethods that are able to learn accurate classifiers while preserving the domainstructure provided through the rank information. We apply these methods to thetask of detecting abnormal cortical regions in the MRIs of patients sufferingfrom focal epilepsy whose MRI were read as normal by expert neuroradiologists.In addition to the noisy labels provided by the results of surgical resection,we employ the results of an invasive intracranial-EEG exam as an additionalsource of label information. Our proposed methods are able to successfullydetect abnormal regions for all patients in our dataset and achieve a higherperformance as compared to baseline methods.

Finding Anomalous Periodic Time Series: An Application to Catalogs of  Periodic Variable Stars

  Catalogs of periodic variable stars contain large numbers of periodiclight-curves (photometric time series data from the astrophysics domain).Separating anomalous objects from well-known classes is an important steptowards the discovery of new classes of astronomical objects. Most anomalydetection methods for time series data assume either a single continuous timeseries or a set of time series whose periods are aligned. Light-curve dataprecludes the use of these methods as the periods of any given pair oflight-curves may be out of sync. One may use an existing anomaly detectionmethod if, prior to similarity calculation, one performs the costly act ofaligning two light-curves, an operation that scales poorly to massive datasets. This paper presents PCAD, an unsupervised anomaly detection method forlarge sets of unsynchronized periodic time-series data, that outputs a rankedlist of both global and local anomalies. It calculates its anomaly score foreach light-curve in relation to a set of centroids produced by a modifiedk-means clustering algorithm. Our method is able to scale to large data setsthrough the use of sampling. We validate our method on both light-curve dataand other time series data sets. We demonstrate its effectiveness at findingknown anomalies, and discuss the effect of sample size and number of centroidson our results. We compare our method to naive solutions and existing timeseries anomaly detection methods for unphased data, and show that PCAD'sreported anomalies are comparable to or better than all other methods. Finally,astrophysicists on our team have verified that PCAD finds true anomalies thatmight be indicative of novel astrophysical phenomena.
