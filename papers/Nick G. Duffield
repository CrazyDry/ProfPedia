Near-Optimal Disjoint-Path Facility Location Through Set Cover by Pairs

  In this paper we consider two special cases of the "cover-by-pairs"optimization problem that arise when we need to place facilities so that eachcustomer is served by two facilities that reach it by disjoint shortest paths.These problems arise in a network traffic monitoring scheme proposed by Breslauet al. and have potential applications to content distribution. The"set-disjoint" variant applies to networks that use the OSPF routing protocol,and the "path-disjoint" variant applies when MPLS routing is enabled, makingbetter solutions possible at the cost of greater operational expense. Althoughwe can prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can guarantee good solutions foreither version, we are able to provide heuristics that do very well in practiceon instances with real-world network structure. Fast implementations of theheuristics, made possible by exploiting mathematical observations about therelationship between the network instances and the corresponding instances ofthe cover-by-pairs problem, allow us to perform an extensive experimentalevaluation of the heuristics and what the solutions they produce tell us aboutthe effectiveness of the proposed monitoring scheme. For the set-disjointvariant, we validate our claim of near-optimality via a new lower-boundinginteger programming formulation. Although computing this lower bound requiressolving the NP-hard Hitting Set problem and can underestimate the optimal valueby a linear factor in the worst case, it can be computed quickly by CPLEX, andit equals the optimal solution value for all the instances in our extensivetestbed.
