On Considering Uncertainty and Alternatives in Low-Level Vision

  In this paper we address the uncertainty issues involved in the low-levelvision task of image segmentation. Researchers in computer vision have workedextensively on this problem, in which the goal is to partition (or segment) animage into regions that are homogeneous or uniform in some sense. Thissegmentation is often utilized by some higher level process, such as an objectrecognition system. We show that by considering uncertainty in a Bayesianformalism, we can use statistical image models to build an approximaterepresentation of a probability distribution over a space of alternativesegmentations. We give detailed descriptions of the various levels ofuncertainty associated with this problem, discuss the interaction of prior andposterior distributions, and provide the operations for constructing thisrepresentation.

Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Graphs: Structure and Computational  Complexity

  We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs (MPP)over four distinct minimization objectives: the total arrival time, themakespan (last arrival time), the total distance, and the maximum (single-robottraveled) distance. On the structure side, we show that each pair of these fourobjectives induces a Pareto front and cannot always be optimizedsimultaneously. Then, through reductions from 3-SAT, we further establish thatcomputation over each objective is an NP-hard task, providing evidence thatsolving MPP optimally is generally intractable. Nevertheless, in a relatedpaper, we design complete algorithms and efficient heuristics for optimizingall four objectives, capable of solving MPP optimally or near-optimally forhundreds of robots in challenging setups.

Distance Optimal Formation Control on Graphs with a Tight Convergence  Time Guarantee

  For the task of moving a set of indistinguishable agents on a connected graphwith unit edge distance to an arbitrary set of goal vertices, free ofcollisions, we propose a fast distance optimal control algorithm that guidesthe agents into the desired formation. Moreover, we show that the algorithmalso provides a tight convergence time guarantee (time optimality and distanceoptimality cannot be simultaneously satisfied). Our generic graph formulationallows the algorithm to be applied to scenarios such as grids with holes(modeling obstacles) in arbitrary dimensions. Simulations, available online,confirm our theoretical developments.

Planning Optimal Paths for Multiple Robots on Graphs

  In this paper, we study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning(MPP) on graphs. We propose two multiflow based integer linear programming(ILP) models that computes minimum last arrival time and minimum total distancesolutions for our MPP formulation, respectively. The resulting algorithms fromthese ILP models are complete and guaranteed to yield true optimal solutions.In addition, our flexible framework can easily accommodate other variants ofthe MPP problem. Focusing on the time optimal algorithm, we evaluate itsperformance, both as a stand alone algorithm and as a generic heuristic forquickly solving large problem instances. Computational results confirm theeffectiveness of our method.

Multi-agent Path Planning and Network Flow

  This paper connects multi-agent path planning on graphs (roadmaps) to networkflow problems, showing that the former can be reduced to the latter, thereforeenabling the application of combinatorial network flow algorithms, as well asgeneral linear program techniques, to multi-agent path planning problems ongraphs. Exploiting this connection, we show that when the goals are permutationinvariant, the problem always has a feasible solution path set with a longestfinish time of no more than $n + V - 1$ steps, in which $n$ is the number ofagents and $V$ is the number of vertices of the underlying graph. We then givea complete algorithm that finds such a solution in $O(nVE)$ time, with $E$being the number of edges of the graph. Taking a further step, we study timeand distance optimality of the feasible solutions, show that they have apairwise Pareto optimal structure, and again provide efficient algorithms foroptimizing two of these practical objectives.

Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Graphs: Complete Algorithms and  Effective Heuristics

  We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs MPP overfour distinct minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), themaximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the totaldistance. In a related paper, we show that these objectives are distinct andNP-hard to optimize. In this work, we focus on efficiently algorithmicsolutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we firstestablish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and network-flow. Based onthis equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel andcomplete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. Inparticular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is afirst such that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems withrobot-vertex ratio as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computationalperformance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principledheuristics, at the expense of some optimality loss. The combination of ILPmodel based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective,allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containinghundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in justseconds.
