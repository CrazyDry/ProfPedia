On Considering Uncertainty and Alternatives in Low-Level Vision

  In this paper we address the uncertainty issues involved in the low-level
vision task of image segmentation. Researchers in computer vision have worked
extensively on this problem, in which the goal is to partition (or segment) an
image into regions that are homogeneous or uniform in some sense. This
segmentation is often utilized by some higher level process, such as an object
recognition system. We show that by considering uncertainty in a Bayesian
formalism, we can use statistical image models to build an approximate
representation of a probability distribution over a space of alternative
segmentations. We give detailed descriptions of the various levels of
uncertainty associated with this problem, discuss the interaction of prior and
posterior distributions, and provide the operations for constructing this
representation.


Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Graphs: Structure and Computational
  Complexity

  We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs (MPP)
over four distinct minimization objectives: the total arrival time, the
makespan (last arrival time), the total distance, and the maximum (single-robot
traveled) distance. On the structure side, we show that each pair of these four
objectives induces a Pareto front and cannot always be optimized
simultaneously. Then, through reductions from 3-SAT, we further establish that
computation over each objective is an NP-hard task, providing evidence that
solving MPP optimally is generally intractable. Nevertheless, in a related
paper, we design complete algorithms and efficient heuristics for optimizing
all four objectives, capable of solving MPP optimally or near-optimally for
hundreds of robots in challenging setups.


Distance Optimal Formation Control on Graphs with a Tight Convergence
  Time Guarantee

  For the task of moving a set of indistinguishable agents on a connected graph
with unit edge distance to an arbitrary set of goal vertices, free of
collisions, we propose a fast distance optimal control algorithm that guides
the agents into the desired formation. Moreover, we show that the algorithm
also provides a tight convergence time guarantee (time optimality and distance
optimality cannot be simultaneously satisfied). Our generic graph formulation
allows the algorithm to be applied to scenarios such as grids with holes
(modeling obstacles) in arbitrary dimensions. Simulations, available online,
confirm our theoretical developments.


Planning Optimal Paths for Multiple Robots on Graphs

  In this paper, we study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning
(MPP) on graphs. We propose two multiflow based integer linear programming
(ILP) models that computes minimum last arrival time and minimum total distance
solutions for our MPP formulation, respectively. The resulting algorithms from
these ILP models are complete and guaranteed to yield true optimal solutions.
In addition, our flexible framework can easily accommodate other variants of
the MPP problem. Focusing on the time optimal algorithm, we evaluate its
performance, both as a stand alone algorithm and as a generic heuristic for
quickly solving large problem instances. Computational results confirm the
effectiveness of our method.


Multi-agent Path Planning and Network Flow

  This paper connects multi-agent path planning on graphs (roadmaps) to network
flow problems, showing that the former can be reduced to the latter, therefore
enabling the application of combinatorial network flow algorithms, as well as
general linear program techniques, to multi-agent path planning problems on
graphs. Exploiting this connection, we show that when the goals are permutation
invariant, the problem always has a feasible solution path set with a longest
finish time of no more than $n + V - 1$ steps, in which $n$ is the number of
agents and $V$ is the number of vertices of the underlying graph. We then give
a complete algorithm that finds such a solution in $O(nVE)$ time, with $E$
being the number of edges of the graph. Taking a further step, we study time
and distance optimality of the feasible solutions, show that they have a
pairwise Pareto optimal structure, and again provide efficient algorithms for
optimizing two of these practical objectives.


Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Graphs: Complete Algorithms and
  Effective Heuristics

  We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs MPP over
four distinct minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), the
maximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the total
distance. In a related paper, we show that these objectives are distinct and
NP-hard to optimize. In this work, we focus on efficiently algorithmic
solutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we first
establish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and network-flow. Based on
this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and
complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In
particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a
first such that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with
robot-vertex ratio as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computational
performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled
heuristics, at the expense of some optimality loss. The combination of ILP
model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective,
allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing
hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just
seconds.
