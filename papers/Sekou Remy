Characterizing the hyper-parameter space of LSTM language models for  mixed context applications

  Applying state of the art deep learning models to novel real world datasetsgives a practical evaluation of the generalizability of these models. Ofimportance in this process is how sensitive the hyper parameters of such modelsare to novel datasets as this would affect the reproducibility of a model. Wepresent work to characterize the hyper parameter space of an LSTM for languagemodeling on a code-mixed corpus. We observe that the evaluated model showsminimal sensitivity to our novel dataset bar a few hyper parameters.

Assessing virtualization effects in simulations of distributed robotics

  In this work, our aim is to identify whether the choice of virtualizationstrategy influences the performance of simulations in robotics. Performance isquantified in the error between a reference trajectory and the actualtrajectory for the ball moving along the surface of a smooth plate. Thetwo-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to assess significance of variationsin performance under the different experimental settings. Our results show thatthe selection of virtualization technology does have a significant effect onsimulation, and moreover this effect can be amplified by the use of someoperating systems. While these results are a strong cause for caution, theyalso provide reason for optimism for those considering 'repeatable roboticsresearch' using virtualization.

Web Standards as Standard Pieces in Robotics

  Modern robotics often involves the use of web technologies as a means to copewith the complexity of design and operation. Many of these technologies havebeen formalized into standards, which are often avoided by those in roboticsand controls because of a sometimes warranted fear that "the web" is too slow,or too uncertain for meaningful control applications.  In this work we argue that while web technologies may not be applicable forall control, they should not be dismissed outright because they can providecritical help with system integration. Web technologies have also advancedsignificantly over the past decade. We present the details of an application ofa web server to perform open and close-loop control (between 3Hz and 1kHz) overa variety of different network topologies. In our study we also consider theimpact of a web browser to implement the control of the plant. Our resultsconfirm that meaningful control can be performed using web technologies, andalso highlight design choices that can limit their applicability.

Using Genetic Algorithms to Benchmark the Cloud

  This paper presents a novel application of Genetic Algorithms(GAs) toquantify the performance of Platform as a Service (PaaS), a cloud service modelthat plays a critical role in both industry and academia. While Cloudbenchmarks are not new, in this novel concept, the authors use a GA to takeadvantage of the elasticity in Cloud services in a graceful manner that was notpreviously possible. Using Google App Engine, Heroku, and Python Anywhere withthree distinct classes of client computers running our GA codebase, wequantified the completion time for application of the GA to search for theparameters of controllers for dynamical systems. Our results show statisticallysignificant differences in PaaS performance by vendor, and also that theperformance of the PaaS performance is dependent upon the client that uses it.Results also show the effectiveness of our GA in determining the level ofservice of PaaS providers, and for determining if the level of service of onePaaS vendor is repeatable with another. Such a concept could then increase theappeal of PaaS Cloud services by making them more financially appealing.

Novel Exploration Techniques (NETs) for Malaria Policy Interventions

  The task of decision-making under uncertainty is daunting, especially forproblems which have significant complexity. Healthcare policy makers across theglobe are facing problems under challenging constraints, with limited tools tohelp them make data driven decisions. In this work we frame the process offinding an optimal malaria policy as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem,and implement three agent based strategies to explore the policy space. Weapply a Gaussian Process regression to the findings of each agent, both forcomparison and to account for stochastic results from simulating the spread ofmalaria in a fixed population. The generated policy spaces are compared withpublished results to give a direct reference with human expert decisions forthe same simulated population. Our novel approach provides a powerful resourcefor policy makers, and a platform which can be readily extended to capturefuture more nuanced policy spaces.

Subset Scanning Over Neural Network Activations

  This work views neural networks as data generating systems and appliesanomalous pattern detection techniques on that data in order to detect when anetwork is processing an anomalous input. Detecting anomalies is a criticalcomponent for multiple machine learning problems including detectingadversarial noise. More broadly, this work is a step towards giving neuralnetworks the ability to recognize an out-of-distribution sample. This is thefirst work to introduce "Subset Scanning" methods from the anomalous patterndetection domain to the task of detecting anomalous input of neural networks.Subset scanning treats the detection problem as a search for the most anomaloussubset of node activations (i.e., highest scoring subset according tonon-parametric scan statistics). Mathematical properties of these scoringfunctions allow the search to be completed in log-linear rather thanexponential time while still guaranteeing the most anomalous subset of nodes inthe network is identified for a given input. Quantitative results for detectingand characterizing adversarial noise are provided for CIFAR-10 images on asimple convolutional neural network. We observe an "interference" pattern whereanomalous activations in shallow layers suppress the activation structure ofthe original image in deeper layers.

Promoting Distributed Trust in Machine Learning and Computational  Simulation via a Blockchain Network

  Policy decisions are increasingly dependent on the outcomes of simulationsand/or machine learning models. The ability to share and interact with theseoutcomes is relevant across multiple fields and is especially critical in thedisease modeling community where models are often only accessible and workableto the researchers that generate them. This work presents a blockchain-enabledsystem that establishes a decentralized trust between parties involved in amodeling process. Utilizing the OpenMalaria framework, we demonstrate theability to store, share and maintain auditable logs and records of each step inthe simulation process, showing how to validate results generated by computingworkers. We also show how the system monitors worker outputs to rank andidentify faulty workers via comparison to nearest neighbors or historicalreward spaces as a means of ensuring model quality.

Trusted Multi-Party Computation and Verifiable Simulations: A Scalable  Blockchain Approach

  Large-scale computational experiments, often running over weeks and overlarge datasets, are used extensively in fields such as epidemiology,meteorology, computational biology, and healthcare to understand phenomena, anddesign high-stakes policies affecting everyday health and economy. Forinstance, the OpenMalaria framework is a computationally-intensive simulationused by various non-governmental and governmental agencies to understandmalarial disease spread and effectiveness of intervention strategies, andsubsequently design healthcare policies. Given that such shared results formthe basis of inferences drawn, technological solutions designed, and day-to-daypolicies drafted, it is essential that the computations are validated andtrusted. In particular, in a multi-agent environment involving severalindependent computing agents, a notion of trust in results generated by peersis critical in facilitating transparency, accountability, and collaboration.Using a novel combination of distributed validation of atomic computationblocks and a blockchain-based immutable audits mechanism, this work proposes auniversal framework for distributed trust in computations. In particular weaddress the scalaibility problem by reducing the storage and communicationcosts using a lossy compression scheme. This framework guarantees not onlyverifiability of final results, but also the validity of local computations,and its cost-benefit tradeoffs are studied using a synthetic example oftraining a neural network.
