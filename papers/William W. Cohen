TensorLog: Deep Learning Meets Probabilistic DBs

  We present an implementation of a probabilistic first-order logic called
TensorLog, in which classes of logical queries are compiled into differentiable
functions in a neural-network infrastructure such as Tensorflow or Theano. This
leads to a close integration of probabilistic logical reasoning with
deep-learning infrastructure: in particular, it enables high-performance deep
learning frameworks to be used for tuning the parameters of a probabilistic
logic. Experimental results show that TensorLog scales to problems involving
hundreds of thousands of knowledge-base triples and tens of thousands of
examples.


The 2-log-convexity of the Apery Numbers

  We present an approach to proving the 2-log-convexity of sequences satisfying
three-term recurrence relations. We show that the Apery numbers, the Cohen-Rhin
numbers, the Motzkin numbers, the Fine numbers, the Franel numbers of order 3
and 4 and the large Schroder numbers are all 2-log-convex. Numerical evidence
suggests that all these sequences are k-log-convex for any $k\geq 1$ possibly
except for a constant number of terms at the beginning.


TensorLog: A Differentiable Deductive Database

  Large knowledge bases (KBs) are useful in many tasks, but it is unclear how
to integrate this sort of knowledge into "deep" gradient-based learning
systems. To address this problem, we describe a probabilistic deductive
database, called TensorLog, in which reasoning uses a differentiable process.
In TensorLog, each clause in a logical theory is first converted into certain
type of factor graph. Then, for each type of query to the factor graph, the
message-passing steps required to perform belief propagation (BP) are
"unrolled" into a function, which is differentiable. We show that these
functions can be composed recursively to perform inference in non-trivial
logical theories containing multiple interrelated clauses and predicates. Both
compilation and inference in TensorLog are efficient: compilation is linear in
theory size and proof depth, and inference is linear in database size and the
number of message-passing steps used in BP. We also present experimental
results with TensorLog and discuss its relationship to other first-order
probabilistic logics.


Programming with Personalized PageRank: A Locally Groundable First-Order
  Probabilistic Logic

  In many probabilistic first-order representation systems, inference is
performed by "grounding"---i.e., mapping it to a propositional representation,
and then performing propositional inference. With a large database of facts,
groundings can be very large, making inference and learning computationally
expensive. Here we present a first-order probabilistic language which is
well-suited to approximate "local" grounding: every query $Q$ can be
approximately grounded with a small graph. The language is an extension of
stochastic logic programs where inference is performed by a variant of
personalized PageRank. Experimentally, we show that the approach performs well
without weight learning on an entity resolution task; that supervised
weight-learning improves accuracy; and that grounding time is independent of DB
size. We also show that order-of-magnitude speedups are possible by
parallelizing learning.


WebSets: Extracting Sets of Entities from the Web Using Unsupervised
  Information Extraction

  We describe a open-domain information extraction method for extracting
concept-instance pairs from an HTML corpus. Most earlier approaches to this
problem rely on combining clusters of distributionally similar terms and
concept-instance pairs obtained with Hearst patterns. In contrast, our method
relies on a novel approach for clustering terms found in HTML tables, and then
assigning concept names to these clusters using Hearst patterns. The method can
be efficiently applied to a large corpus, and experimental results on several
datasets show that our method can accurately extract large numbers of
concept-instance pairs.


A Comparative Study of Word Embeddings for Reading Comprehension

  The focus of past machine learning research for Reading Comprehension tasks
has been primarily on the design of novel deep learning architectures. Here we
show that seemingly minor choices made on (1) the use of pre-trained word
embeddings, and (2) the representation of out-of-vocabulary tokens at test
time, can turn out to have a larger impact than architectural choices on the
final performance. We systematically explore several options for these choices,
and provide recommendations to researchers working in this area.


Bispindles in strongly connected digraphs with large chromatic number

  A $(k_1+k_2)$-bispindle is the union of $k_1$ $(x,y)$-dipaths and $k_2$
$(y,x)$-dipaths, all these dipaths being pairwise internally disjoint.
Recently, Cohen et al. showed that for every $(1,1)$- bispindle $B$, there
exists an integer $k$ such that every strongly connected digraph with chromatic
number greater than $k$ contains a subdivision of $B$. We investigate
generalisations of this result by first showing constructions of strongly
connected digraphs with large chromatic number without any $(3,0)$-bispindle or
$(2,2)$-bispindle. Then we show that strongly connected digraphs with large
chromatic number contains a $(2,1)$-bispindle, where at least one of the
$(x,y)$-dipaths and the $(y,x)$-dipath are long.


Semi-Supervised Learning with Declaratively Specified Entropy
  Constraints

  We propose a technique for declaratively specifying strategies for
semi-supervised learning (SSL). The proposed method can be used to specify
ensembles of semi-supervised learning, as well as agreement constraints and
entropic regularization constraints between these learners, and can be used to
model both well-known heuristics such as co-training and novel domain-specific
heuristics. In addition to representing individual SSL heuristics, we show that
multiple heuristics can also be automatically combined using Bayesian
optimization methods. We show consistent improvements on a suite of
well-studied SSL benchmarks, including a new state-of-the-art result on a
difficult relation extraction task.


The Effect of Biased Communications On Both Trusting and Suspicious
  Voters

  In recent studies of political decision-making, apparently anomalous behavior
has been observed on the part of voters, in which negative information about a
candidate strengthens, rather than weakens, a prior positive opinion about the
candidate. This behavior appears to run counter to rational models of decision
making, and it is sometimes interpreted as evidence of non-rational "motivated
reasoning". We consider scenarios in which this effect arises in a model of
rational decision making which includes the possibility of deceptive
information. In particular, we will consider a model in which there are two
classes of voters, which we will call trusting voters and suspicious voters,
and two types of information sources, which we will call unbiased sources and
biased sources. In our model, new data about a candidate can be efficiently
incorporated by a trusting voter, and anomalous updates are impossible;
however, anomalous updates can be made by suspicious voters, if the information
source mistakenly plans for an audience of trusting voters, and if the partisan
goals of the information source are known by the suspicious voter to be
"opposite" to his own. Our model is based on a formalism introduced by the
artificial intelligence community called "multi-agent influence diagrams",
which generalize Bayesian networks to settings involving multiple agents with
distinct goals.


Efficient Inference and Learning in a Large Knowledge Base: Reasoning
  with Extracted Information using a Locally Groundable First-Order
  Probabilistic Logic

  One important challenge for probabilistic logics is reasoning with very large
knowledge bases (KBs) of imperfect information, such as those produced by
modern web-scale information extraction systems. One scalability problem shared
by many probabilistic logics is that answering queries involves "grounding" the
query---i.e., mapping it to a propositional representation---and the size of a
"grounding" grows with database size. To address this bottleneck, we present a
first-order probabilistic language called ProPPR in which that approximate
"local groundings" can be constructed in time independent of database size.
Technically, ProPPR is an extension to stochastic logic programs (SLPs) that is
biased towards short derivations; it is also closely related to an earlier
relational learning algorithm called the path ranking algorithm (PRA). We show
that the problem of constructing proofs for this logic is related to
computation of personalized PageRank (PPR) on a linearized version of the proof
space, and using on this connection, we develop a proveably-correct approximate
grounding scheme, based on the PageRank-Nibble algorithm. Building on this, we
develop a fast and easily-parallelized weight-learning algorithm for ProPPR. In
experiments, we show that learning for ProPPR is orders magnitude faster than
learning for Markov logic networks; that allowing mutual recursion (joint
learning) in KB inference leads to improvements in performance; and that ProPPR
can learn weights for a mutually recursive program with hundreds of clauses,
which define scores of interrelated predicates, over a KB containing one
million entities.


Magnetic moments of light nuclei from lattice quantum chromodynamics

  We present the results of lattice QCD calculations of the magnetic moments of
the lightest nuclei, the deuteron, the triton and ${}^3$He, along with those of
the neutron and proton. These calculations, performed at quark masses
corresponding to $m_\pi \sim 800$ MeV, reveal that the structure of these
nuclei at unphysically heavy quark masses closely resembles that at the
physical quark masses. In particular, we find that the magnetic moment of
${}^3$He differs only slightly from that of a free neutron, as is the case in
nature, indicating that the shell-model configuration of two spin-paired
protons and a valence neutron captures its dominant structure. Similarly a
shell-model-like moment is found for the triton, $\mu_{{}^3{\rm H}} \sim
\mu_p$. The deuteron magnetic moment is found to be equal to the nucleon
isoscalar moment within the uncertainties of the calculations.


Quarkonium-Nucleus Bound States from Lattice QCD

  Quarkonium-nucleus systems are composed of two interacting hadronic states
without common valence quarks, which interact primarily through multi-gluon
exchanges, realizing a color van der Waals force. We present lattice QCD
calculations of the interactions of strange and charm quarkonia with light
nuclei. Both the strangeonium-nucleus and charmonium-nucleus systems are found
to be relatively deeply bound when the masses of the three light quarks are set
equal to that of the physical strange quark. Extrapolation of these results to
the physical light-quark masses suggests that the binding energy of charmonium
to nuclear matter is B < 40 MeV.


An Unusual Eclipse of a Pre-Main Sequence Star in IC 348

  A solar-like pre-main sequence star (TJ 108 = H 187 = LRLL 35 = HMW 15) in
the extremely young cluster IC 348 has been found, which apparently experienced
an eclipse lasting ~3.5 years, much longer than has ever been detected for any
normal eclipsing binary. The light curve is flat-bottomed and rather symmetric,
with a depth of 0.66 mag in Cousins I. During eclipse, the system reddened by
\~0.17 mag in R-I. We argue that the eclipsing body is not a star because of
the small probability of detecting an eclipse in what would be a very widely
separated binary. Instead, it appears that the eclipse was caused by a
circumstellar or circumbinary cloud or disk feature which occulted the star, or
one of its components, if it is a binary system. We emphasize the importance of
more detailed study of this object, which appears to be a new member of a small
class of pre-main sequence stars whose variability can be firmly linked to
occultation by circumstellar (or circumbinary) matter.


Application of a semiclassical model for the second-quantized
  many-electron Hamiltonian to nonequilibrium quantum transport: The resonant
  level model

  A semiclassical (SC) approach is developed for nonequilibrium quantum
transport in molecular junctions. Following the early work of Miller and White
[J. Chem. Phys. 84, 5059 (1986)], the many-electron Hamiltonian in second
quantization is mapped onto a classical model that preserves the fermionic
character of electrons. The resulting classical electronic Hamiltonian allows
for real-time molecular dynamics simulations of the many-body problem from an
uncorrelated initial state to the steady state. Comparisons with exact results
generated for the resonant level model reveal that a semiclassical treatment of
transport provides a quantitative description of the dynamics at all relevant
timescales for a wide range of bias and gate potentials, and for different
temperatures. The approach opens a door to treating nontrivial quantum
transport problems that remain far from the reach of fully quantum
methodologies.


Vlasov simulation in multiple spatial dimensions

  A long-standing challenge encountered in modeling plasma dynamics is
achieving practical Vlasov equation simulation in multiple spatial dimensions
over large length and time scales. While direct multi-dimension Vlasov
simulation methods using adaptive mesh methods [J. W. Banks et al., Physics of
Plasmas 18, no. 5 (2011): 052102; B. I. Cohen et al., November 10, 2010,
http://meetings.aps.org/link/BAPS.2010.DPP.NP9.142] have recently shown
promising results, in this paper we present an alternative, the Vlasov Multi
Dimensional (VMD) model, that is specifically designed to take advantage of
solution properties in regimes when plasma waves are confined to a narrow cone,
as may be the case for stimulated Raman scatter in large optic f# laser beams.
Perpendicular grid spacing large compared to a Debye length is then possible
without instability, enabling an order 10 decrease in required computational
resources compared to standard particle in cell (PIC) methods in 2D, with
another reduction of that order in 3D. Further advantage compared to PIC
methods accrues in regimes where particle noise is an issue. VMD and PIC
results in a 2D model of localized Langmuir waves are in qualitative agreement.


Exploratory Learning

  In multiclass semi-supervised learning (SSL), it is sometimes the case that
the number of classes present in the data is not known, and hence no labeled
examples are provided for some classes. In this paper we present variants of
well-known semi-supervised multiclass learning methods that are robust when the
data contains an unknown number of classes. In particular, we present an
"exploratory" extension of expectation-maximization (EM) that explores
different numbers of classes while learning. "Exploratory" SSL greatly improves
performance on three datasets in terms of F1 on the classes with seed examples
i.e., the classes which are expected to be in the data. Our Exploratory EM
algorithm also outperforms a SSL method based non-parametric Bayesian
clustering.


Grounded Discovery of Coordinate Term Relationships between Software
  Entities

  We present an approach for the detection of coordinate-term relationships
between entities from the software domain, that refer to Java classes. Usually,
relations are found by examining corpus statistics associated with text
entities. In some technical domains, however, we have access to additional
information about the real-world objects named by the entities, suggesting that
coupling information about the "grounded" entities with corpus statistics might
lead to improved methods for relation discovery. To this end, we develop a
similarity measure for Java classes using distributional information about how
they are used in software, which we combine with corpus statistics on the
distribution of contexts in which the classes appear in text. Using our
approach, cross-validation accuracy on this dataset can be improved
dramatically, from around 60% to 88%. Human labeling results show that our
classifier has an F1 score of 86% over the top 1000 predicted pairs.


Gated-Attention Readers for Text Comprehension

  In this paper we study the problem of answering cloze-style questions over
documents. Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop
architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative
interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a
recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build
query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer
selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks
for this task--the CNN \& Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset.
The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation
study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing
the gated-attention. The code is available at
https://github.com/bdhingra/ga-reader.


Bootstrapping Distantly Supervised IE using Joint Learning and Small
  Well-structured Corpora

  We propose a framework to improve performance of distantly-supervised
relation extraction, by jointly learning to solve two related tasks:
concept-instance extraction and relation extraction. We combine this with a
novel use of document structure: in some small, well-structured corpora,
sections can be identified that correspond to relation arguments, and
distantly-labeled examples from such sections tend to have good precision.
Using these as seeds we extract additional relation examples by applying label
propagation on a graph composed of noisy examples extracted from a large
unstructured testing corpus. Combined with the soft constraint that concept
examples should have the same type as the second argument of the relation, we
get significant improvements over several state-of-the-art approaches to
distantly-supervised relation extraction.


Distant IE by Bootstrapping Using Lists and Document Structure

  Distant labeling for information extraction (IE) suffers from noisy training
data. We describe a way of reducing the noise associated with distant IE by
identifying coupling constraints between potential instance labels. As one
example of coupling, items in a list are likely to have the same label. A
second example of coupling comes from analysis of document structure: in some
corpora, sections can be identified such that items in the same section are
likely to have the same label. Such sections do not exist in all corpora, but
we show that augmenting a large corpus with coupling constraints from even a
small, well-structured corpus can improve performance substantially, doubling
F1 on one task.


Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings

  We present a semi-supervised learning framework based on graph embeddings.
Given a graph between instances, we train an embedding for each instance to
jointly predict the class label and the neighborhood context in the graph. We
develop both transductive and inductive variants of our method. In the
transductive variant of our method, the class labels are determined by both the
learned embeddings and input feature vectors, while in the inductive variant,
the embeddings are defined as a parametric function of the feature vectors, so
predictions can be made on instances not seen during training. On a large and
diverse set of benchmark tasks, including text classification, distantly
supervised entity extraction, and entity classification, we show improved
performance over many of the existing models.


Tweet2Vec: Character-Based Distributed Representations for Social Media

  Text from social media provides a set of challenges that can cause
traditional NLP approaches to fail. Informal language, spelling errors,
abbreviations, and special characters are all commonplace in these posts,
leading to a prohibitively large vocabulary size for word-level approaches. We
propose a character composition model, tweet2vec, which finds vector-space
representations of whole tweets by learning complex, non-local dependencies in
character sequences. The proposed model outperforms a word-level baseline at
predicting user-annotated hashtags associated with the posts, doing
significantly better when the input contains many out-of-vocabulary words or
unusual character sequences. Our tweet2vec encoder is publicly available.


Review Networks for Caption Generation

  We propose a novel extension of the encoder-decoder framework, called a
review network. The review network is generic and can enhance any existing
encoder- decoder model: in this paper, we consider RNN decoders with both CNN
and RNN encoders. The review network performs a number of review steps with
attention mechanism on the encoder hidden states, and outputs a thought vector
after each review step; the thought vectors are used as the input of the
attention mechanism in the decoder. We show that conventional encoder-decoders
are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we show that our framework
improves over state-of- the-art encoder-decoder systems on the tasks of image
captioning and source code captioning.


Words or Characters? Fine-grained Gating for Reading Comprehension

  Previous work combines word-level and character-level representations using
concatenation or scalar weighting, which is suboptimal for high-level tasks
like reading comprehension. We present a fine-grained gating mechanism to
dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on
properties of the words. We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to
modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading
comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance
on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
Children's Book Test dataset. To demonstrate the generality of our gating
mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task.


Semi-Supervised QA with Generative Domain-Adaptive Nets

  We study the problem of semi-supervised question answering----utilizing
unlabeled text to boost the performance of question answering models. We
propose a novel training framework, the Generative Domain-Adaptive Nets. In
this framework, we train a generative model to generate questions based on the
unlabeled text, and combine model-generated questions with human-generated
questions for training question answering models. We develop novel domain
adaptation algorithms, based on reinforcement learning, to alleviate the
discrepancy between the model-generated data distribution and the
human-generated data distribution. Experiments show that our proposed framework
obtains substantial improvement from unlabeled text.


Differentiable Learning of Logical Rules for Knowledge Base Reasoning

  We study the problem of learning probabilistic first-order logical rules for
knowledge base reasoning. This learning problem is difficult because it
requires learning the parameters in a continuous space as well as the structure
in a discrete space. We propose a framework, Neural Logic Programming, that
combines the parameter and structure learning of first-order logical rules in
an end-to-end differentiable model. This approach is inspired by a
recently-developed differentiable logic called TensorLog, where inference tasks
can be compiled into sequences of differentiable operations. We design a neural
controller system that learns to compose these operations. Empirically, our
method outperforms prior work on multiple knowledge base benchmark datasets,
including Freebase and WikiMovies.


Using Graphs of Classifiers to Impose Declarative Constraints on
  Semi-supervised Learning

  We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning (SSL)
algorithms. Specifically, we present a declarative language for modeling both
traditional supervised classification tasks and many SSL heuristics, including
both well-known heuristics such as co-training and novel domain-specific
heuristics. In addition to representing individual SSL heuristics, we show that
multiple heuristics can be automatically combined using Bayesian optimization
methods. We experiment with two classes of tasks, link-based text
classification and relation extraction. We show modest improvements on
well-studied link-based classification benchmarks, and state-of-the-art results
on relation-extraction tasks for two realistic domains.


Linguistic Knowledge as Memory for Recurrent Neural Networks

  Training recurrent neural networks to model long term dependencies is
difficult. Hence, we propose to use external linguistic knowledge as an
explicit signal to inform the model which memories it should utilize.
Specifically, external knowledge is used to augment a sequence with typed edges
between arbitrarily distant elements, and the resulting graph is decomposed
into directed acyclic subgraphs. We introduce a model that encodes such graphs
as explicit memory in recurrent neural networks, and use it to model
coreference relations in text. We apply our model to several text comprehension
tasks and achieve new state-of-the-art results on all considered benchmarks,
including CNN, bAbi, and LAMBADA. On the bAbi QA tasks, our model solves 15 out
of the 20 tasks with only 1000 training examples per task. Analysis of the
learned representations further demonstrates the ability of our model to encode
fine-grained entity information across a document.


Transfer Learning for Sequence Tagging with Hierarchical Recurrent
  Networks

  Recent papers have shown that neural networks obtain state-of-the-art
performance on several different sequence tagging tasks. One appealing property
of such systems is their generality, as excellent performance can be achieved
with a unified architecture and without task-specific feature engineering.
However, it is unclear if such systems can be used for tasks without large
amounts of training data. In this paper we explore the problem of transfer
learning for neural sequence taggers, where a source task with plentiful
annotations (e.g., POS tagging on Penn Treebank) is used to improve performance
on a target task with fewer available annotations (e.g., POS tagging for
microblogs). We examine the effects of transfer learning for deep hierarchical
recurrent networks across domains, applications, and languages, and show that
significant improvement can often be obtained. These improvements lead to
improvements over the current state-of-the-art on several well-studied tasks.


Good Semi-supervised Learning that Requires a Bad GAN

  Semi-supervised learning methods based on generative adversarial networks
(GANs) obtained strong empirical results, but it is not clear 1) how the
discriminator benefits from joint training with a generator, and 2) why good
semi-supervised classification performance and a good generator cannot be
obtained at the same time. Theoretically, we show that given the discriminator
objective, good semisupervised learning indeed requires a bad generator, and
propose the definition of a preferred generator. Empirically, we derive a novel
formulation based on our analysis that substantially improves over feature
matching GANs, obtaining state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets.


Breaking the Softmax Bottleneck: A High-Rank RNN Language Model

  We formulate language modeling as a matrix factorization problem, and show
that the expressiveness of Softmax-based models (including the majority of
neural language models) is limited by a Softmax bottleneck. Given that natural
language is highly context-dependent, this further implies that in practice
Softmax with distributed word embeddings does not have enough capacity to model
natural language. We propose a simple and effective method to address this
issue, and improve the state-of-the-art perplexities on Penn Treebank and
WikiText-2 to 47.69 and 40.68 respectively. The proposed method also excels on
the large-scale 1B Word dataset, outperforming the baseline by over 5.6 points
in perplexity.


Neural Models for Reasoning over Multiple Mentions using Coreference

  Many problems in NLP require aggregating information from multiple mentions
of the same entity which may be far apart in the text. Existing Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) layers are biased towards short-term dependencies and
hence not suited to such tasks. We present a recurrent layer which is instead
biased towards coreferent dependencies. The layer uses coreference annotations
extracted from an external system to connect entity mentions belonging to the
same cluster. Incorporating this layer into a state-of-the-art reading
comprehension model improves performance on three datasets -- Wikihop, LAMBADA
and the bAbi AI tasks -- with large gains when training data is scarce.


GLoMo: Unsupervisedly Learned Relational Graphs as Transferable
  Representations

  Modern deep transfer learning approaches have mainly focused on learning
generic feature vectors from one task that are transferable to other tasks,
such as word embeddings in language and pretrained convolutional features in
vision. However, these approaches usually transfer unary features and largely
ignore more structured graphical representations. This work explores the
possibility of learning generic latent relational graphs that capture
dependencies between pairs of data units (e.g., words or pixels) from
large-scale unlabeled data and transferring the graphs to downstream tasks. Our
proposed transfer learning framework improves performance on various tasks
including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis,
and image classification. We also show that the learned graphs are generic
enough to be transferred to different embeddings on which the graphs have not
been trained (including GloVe embeddings, ELMo embeddings, and task-specific
RNN hidden unit), or embedding-free units such as image pixels.


Open Domain Question Answering Using Early Fusion of Knowledge Bases and
  Text

  Open Domain Question Answering (QA) is evolving from complex pipelined
systems to end-to-end deep neural networks. Specialized neural models have been
developed for extracting answers from either text alone or Knowledge Bases
(KBs) alone. In this paper we look at a more practical setting, namely QA over
the combination of a KB and entity-linked text, which is appropriate when an
incomplete KB is available with a large text corpus. Building on recent
advances in graph representation learning we propose a novel model, GRAFT-Net,
for extracting answers from a question-specific subgraph containing text and KB
entities and relations. We construct a suite of benchmark tasks for this
problem, varying the difficulty of questions, the amount of training data, and
KB completeness. We show that GRAFT-Net is competitive with the
state-of-the-art when tested using either KBs or text alone, and vastly
outperforms existing methods in the combined setting. Source code is available
at https://github.com/OceanskySun/GraftNet .


HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question
  Answering

  Existing question answering (QA) datasets fail to train QA systems to perform
complex reasoning and provide explanations for answers. We introduce HotpotQA,
a new dataset with 113k Wikipedia-based question-answer pairs with four key
features: (1) the questions require finding and reasoning over multiple
supporting documents to answer; (2) the questions are diverse and not
constrained to any pre-existing knowledge bases or knowledge schemas; (3) we
provide sentence-level supporting facts required for reasoning, allowing QA
systems to reason with strong supervision and explain the predictions; (4) we
offer a new type of factoid comparison questions to test QA systems' ability to
extract relevant facts and perform necessary comparison. We show that HotpotQA
is challenging for the latest QA systems, and the supporting facts enable
models to improve performance and make explainable predictions.


Incremental Reading for Question Answering

  Any system which performs goal-directed continual learning must not only
learn incrementally but process and absorb information incrementally. Such a
system also has to understand when its goals have been achieved. In this paper,
we consider these issues in the context of question answering. Current
state-of-the-art question answering models reason over an entire passage, not
incrementally. As we will show, naive approaches to incremental reading, such
as restriction to unidirectional language models in the model, perform poorly.
We present extensions to the DocQA [2] model to allow incremental reading
without loss of accuracy. The model also jointly learns to provide the best
answer given the text that is seen so far and predict whether this best-so-far
answer is sufficient.


Probing Biomedical Embeddings from Language Models

  Contextualized word embeddings derived from pre-trained language models (LMs)
show significant improvements on downstream NLP tasks. Pre-training on
domain-specific corpora, such as biomedical articles, further improves their
performance. In this paper, we conduct probing experiments to determine what
additional information is carried intrinsically by the in-domain trained
contextualized embeddings. For this we use the pre-trained LMs as fixed feature
extractors and restrict the downstream task models to not have additional
sequence modeling layers. We compare BERT, ELMo, BioBERT and BioELMo, a
biomedical version of ELMo trained on 10M PubMed abstracts. Surprisingly, while
fine-tuned BioBERT is better than BioELMo in biomedical NER and NLI tasks, as a
fixed feature extractor BioELMo outperforms BioBERT in our probing tasks. We
use visualization and nearest neighbor analysis to show that better encoding of
entity-type and relational information leads to this superiority.


The First Extrasolar Planet Discovered with a New Generation High
  Throughput Doppler Instrument

  We report the detection of the first extrasolar planet, ET-1 (HD 102195b),
using the Exoplanet Tracker (ET), a new generation Doppler instrument. The
planet orbits HD 102195, a young star with solar metallicity that may be part
of the local association. The planet imparts radial velocity variability to the
star with a semiamplitude of $63.4\pm2.0$ m s$^{-1}$ and a period of 4.11 days.
The planetary minimum mass ($m \sin i$) is $0.488\pm0.015$ $M_J$.


Nuclear σ-terms and Scalar-Isoscalar WIMP-Nucleus Interactions from
  Lattice QCD

  It has been argued that the leading scalar-isoscalar WIMP-nucleus
interactions receive parametrically enhanced contributions in the context of
nuclear effective field theories. These contributions arise from meson-exchange
currents (MECs) and potentially modify the impulse approximation estimates of
these interactions by 10--60%. We point out that these MECs also contribute to
the quark mass dependence of nuclear binding energies, that is, nuclear
\sigma-terms. In this work, we use recent lattice QCD calculations of the
binding energies of the deuteron, He-3 and He-4 at pion masses near 500 MeV and
800 MeV, combined with the experimentally determined binding energies at the
physical point, to provide approximate determinations of the \sigma-terms for
these light nuclei. For each nucleus, we find that the deviation of the
corresponding nuclear \sigma-term from the single-nucleon estimate is at the
few percent level, in conflict with the conjectured enhancement. As a
consequence, lattice QCD calculations currently indicate that the cross
sections for scalar-isoscalar WIMP-nucleus interactions arising from
fundamental WIMP interactions with quarks do not suffer from significant
uncertainties due to enhanced meson-exchange currents.


A Multi-Year Photometric Study of IC 348

  The extremely young cluster IC 348 has been monitored photometrically over 5
observing seasons from Dec 1998 to March 2003 in Cousins I with a 0.6 m
telescope at Van Vleck Observatory. Twenty-eight periodic variables and 16
irregular variables have been identified. Among the brighter stars, 14 of the
16 known K or M-type WTTS were found to be periodic variables, while all 5 of
the known CTTS were found to be irregular variables. In the full sample, which
includes 150 stars with I mag as faint as 18, we find that 40% of the 63 WTTS
are detected as variables, nearly all of them periodic, while 55% of the 20
CTTS are also detected as variable, with none of them periodic. Our study
suggests that 80-90% of all WTTS in young clusters will be detected as periodic
variables given sufficiently precise and extended monitoring, whereas CTTS will
reveal themselves primarily or solely as irregular variables. This has clear
consequences for PMS rotational studies based on photometric periods. We
examine the stability of the periodic light curves from season to season. All
periodic stars show modulations of their amplitude, mean brightness and light
curve shape on time scales of less than 1 yr, presumably due to changes in spot
configurations and/or physical characteristics. In no case, however, can we
find definitive evidence of a change in period, indicating that differential
rotation is probably much less on WTTS than it is on the Sun. Among the
non-periodic stars, we report the detection of two possible UXors as well as a
pre-main sequence star, HMW 15, which apparently undergoes an eclipse with a
duration exceeding three years.


Semantic Scan: Detecting Subtle, Spatially Localized Events in Text
  Streams

  Early detection and precise characterization of emerging topics in text
streams can be highly useful in applications such as timely and targeted public
health interventions and discovering evolving regional business trends. Many
methods have been proposed for detecting emerging events in text streams using
topic modeling. However, these methods have numerous shortcomings that make
them unsuitable for rapid detection of locally emerging events on massive text
streams. In this paper, we describe Semantic Scan (SS) that has been developed
specifically to overcome these shortcomings in detecting new spatially compact
events in text streams.
  Semantic Scan integrates novel contrastive topic modeling with online
document assignment and principled likelihood ratio-based spatial scanning to
identify emerging events with unexpected patterns of keywords hidden in text
streams. This enables more timely and accurate detection and characterization
of anomalous, spatially localized emerging events. Semantic Scan does not
require manual intervention or labeled training data, and is robust to noise in
real-world text data since it identifies anomalous text patterns that occur in
a cluster of new documents rather than an anomaly in a single new document.
  We compare Semantic Scan to alternative state-of-the-art methods such as
Topics over Time, Online LDA, and Labeled LDA on two real-world tasks: (i) a
disease surveillance task monitoring free-text Emergency Department chief
complaints in Allegheny County, and (ii) an emerging business trend detection
task based on Yelp reviews. On both tasks, we find that Semantic Scan provides
significantly better event detection and characterization accuracy than
competing approaches, while providing up to an order of magnitude speedup.


Quasar: Datasets for Question Answering by Search and Reading

  We present two new large-scale datasets aimed at evaluating systems designed
to comprehend a natural language query and extract its answer from a large
corpus of text. The Quasar-S dataset consists of 37000 cloze-style
(fill-in-the-gap) queries constructed from definitions of software entity tags
on the popular website Stack Overflow. The posts and comments on the website
serve as the background corpus for answering the cloze questions. The Quasar-T
dataset consists of 43000 open-domain trivia questions and their answers
obtained from various internet sources. ClueWeb09 serves as the background
corpus for extracting these answers. We pose these datasets as a challenge for
two related subtasks of factoid Question Answering: (1) searching for relevant
pieces of text that include the correct answer to a query, and (2) reading the
retrieved text to answer the query. We also describe a retrieval system for
extracting relevant sentences and documents from the corpus given a query, and
include these in the release for researchers wishing to only focus on (2). We
evaluate several baselines on both datasets, ranging from simple heuristics to
powerful neural models, and show that these lag behind human performance by
16.4% and 32.1% for Quasar-S and -T respectively. The datasets are available at
https://github.com/bdhingra/quasar .


Learning to Organize Knowledge and Answer Questions with N-Gram Machines

  Though deep neural networks have great success in natural language
processing, they are limited at more knowledge intensive AI tasks, such as
open-domain Question Answering (QA). Existing end-to-end deep QA models need to
process the entire text after observing the question, and therefore their
complexity in responding a question is linear in the text size. This is
prohibitive for practical tasks such as QA from Wikipedia, a novel, or the Web.
We propose to solve this scalability issue by using symbolic meaning
representations, which can be indexed and retrieved efficiently with complexity
that is independent of the text size. We apply our approach, called the N-Gram
Machine (NGM), to three representative tasks. First as proof-of-concept, we
demonstrate that NGM successfully solves the bAbI tasks of synthetic text.
Second, we show that NGM scales to large corpus by experimenting on "life-long
bAbI", a special version of bAbI that contains millions of sentences. Lastly on
the WikiMovies dataset, we use NGM to induce latent structure (i.e. schema) and
answer questions from natural language Wikipedia text, with only QA pairs as
weak supervision.


From genome to phenome: Predicting multiple cancer phenotypes based on
  somatic genomic alterations via the genomic impact transformer

  Motivation: Cancers are mainly caused by somatic genomic alterations (SGAs)
that perturb cellular signaling systems and eventually activate oncogenic
processes. Therefore, understanding the functional impact of SGAs is a
fundamental task in cancer biology and precision oncology. Here, we present a
deep neural network model with encoder-decoder architecture, referred to as
genomic impact transformer (GIT), to infer the functional impact of SGAs on
cellular signaling systems through modeling the statistical relationships
between SGA events and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumors. The
model utilizes multi-head self-attention mechanism to identify SGAs that likely
cause DEGs, or in other words differentiating potential driver SGAs from
passenger ones in a tumor. GIT model learns a vector (gene embedding) as an
abstract representation of functional impact for each SGA-affected gene. Given
SGAs of a tumor, the model can instantiate the states of the hidden layer,
providing abstract representation (tumor embedding) reflecting characteristics
of perturbed molecular/cellular processes in the tumor, which in turn can be
used to predict multiple phenotypes. Results: We apply the GIT model to 4,468
tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The attention
mechanism enables the model to better capture the statistical relationship
between SGAs and DEGs than conventional methods, and distinguishes cancer
drivers from passengers. The learned gene embeddings capture the functional
similarity of SGAs perturbing common pathways. The tumor embeddings are shown
to be useful for tumor status representation, and phenotype prediction
including patient survival time and drug response of cancer cell lines.


The Spitzer Local Volume Legacy: Survey Description and Infrared
  Photometry

  The survey description and the near-, mid-, and far-infrared flux properties
are presented for the 258 galaxies in the Local Volume Legacy (LVL). LVL is a
Spitzer Space Telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to
11 Mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, H-alpha, and HST imaging from
11HUGS (11 Mpc H-alpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey) and ANGST (ACS Nearby
Galaxy Survey Treasury). LVL covers an unbiased, representative, and
statistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting the
highest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with Spitzer. As a result
of its approximately volume-limited nature, LVL augments previous Spitzer
observations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of the
low-luminosity galaxy population. The collection of LVL galaxies shows a large
spread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8um
PAH emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. Conversely, the
far-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with a
dispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. In terms of the relation
between infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the LVL
sample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios than
starburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important in
the lower mass systems that dominate the LVL sample. Comparisons with
theoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relation
found for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populations
that dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.


Extinction and Dust Geometry in M83 HII Regions: A Hubble Space
  Telescope/WFC3 Study

  We present HST/WFC3 narrow-band imaging of the starburst galaxy M83 targeting
the hydrogen recombination lines (H$\beta$, H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$), which we
use to investigate the dust extinction in the HII regions. We derive extinction
maps with 6 parsec spatial resolution from two combinations of hydrogen lines
(H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$/Pa$\beta$), and show that the longer
wavelengths probe larger optical depths, with $A_V$ values larger by $\gtrsim$1
mag than those derived from the shorter wavelengths. This difference leads to a
factor $\gtrsim$2 discrepancy in the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity,
a significant effect when studying extragalactic HII regions. By comparing
these observations to a series of simple models, we conclude that a large
diversity of absorber/emitter geometric configurations can account for the
data, implying a more complex physical structure than the classical foreground
"dust screen" assumption. However, most data points are bracketed by the
foreground screen and a model where dust and emitters are uniformly mixed. When
averaged over large ($\gtrsim$100--200 pc) scales, the extinction becomes
consistent with a "dust screen", suggesting that other geometries tend to be
restricted to more local scales. Moreover, the extinction in any region can be
described by a combination of the foreground screen and the uniform mixture
model with weights of 1/3 and 2/3 in the center ($\lesssim$2 kpc),
respectively, and 2/3 and 1/3 for the rest of the disk. This simple
prescription significantly improves the accuracy of the dust extinction
corrections and can be especially useful for pixel-based analyses of galaxies
similar to M83.


Spitzer Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud, Surveying the Agents of a
  Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) I: Overview and Initial Results

  We are performing a uniform and unbiased, ~7x7 degrees imaging survey of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the IRAC and MIPS instruments on board the
Spitzer Space Telescope in order to survey the agents of a galaxy's evolution
(SAGE), the interstellar medium (ISM) and stars in the LMC. The detection of
diffuse ISM with column densities >1.2x10^21 H cm^-2 permits detailed studies
of dust processes in the ISM. SAGE's point source sensitivity enables a
complete census of newly formed stars with masses >3 solar masses that will
determine the current star formation rate in the LMC. SAGE's detection of
evolved stars with mass loss rates >1x10^-8 solar masses per year will quantify
the rate at which evolved stars inject mass into the ISM of the LMC. The
observing strategy includes two epochs in 2005, separated by three months, that
both mitigate instrumental artifacts and constrain source variability. The SAGE
data are non-proprietary. The data processing includes IRAC and MIPS pipelines
and a database for mining the point source catalogs, which will be released to
the community in support of Spitzer proposal cycles 4 and 5. We present initial
results on the epoch 1 data with a special focus on the N79 and N83 region. The
SAGE epoch 1 point source catalog has ~4 million sources. The point source
counts are highest for the IRAC 3.6 microns band and decrease dramatically
towards longer wavelengths consistent with the fact that stars dominate the
point source catalogs and that the dusty objects, e.g. young stellar objects
and dusty evolved stars that detected at the longer wavelengths, are rare in
comparison. We outline a strategy for identifying foreground MW stars, that may
comprise as much as 18% of the source list, and background galaxies, that may
comprise ~12% of the source list.

Ionization Electron Signal Processing in Single Phase LArTPCs I.
  Algorithm Description and Quantitative Evaluation with MicroBooNE Simulation

  We describe the concept and procedure of drifted-charge extraction developed
in the MicroBooNE experiment, a single-phase liquid argon time projection
chamber (LArTPC). This technique converts the raw digitized TPC waveform to the
number of ionization electrons passing through a wire plane at a given time. A
robust recovery of the number of ionization electrons from both induction and
collection anode wire planes will augment the 3D reconstruction, and is
particularly important for tomographic reconstruction algorithms. A number of
building blocks of the overall procedure are described. The performance of the
signal processing is quantitatively evaluated by comparing extracted charge
with the true charge through a detailed TPC detector simulation taking into
account position-dependent induced current inside a single wire region and
across multiple wires. Some areas for further improvement of the performance of
the charge extraction procedure are also discussed.


Ionization Electron Signal Processing in Single Phase LArTPCs II.
  Data/Simulation Comparison and Performance in MicroBooNE

  The single-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) provides a
large amount of detailed information in the form of fine-grained drifted
ionization charge from particle traces. To fully utilize this information, the
deposited charge must be accurately extracted from the raw digitized waveforms
via a robust signal processing chain. Enabled by the ultra-low noise levels
associated with cryogenic electronics in the MicroBooNE detector, the precise
extraction of ionization charge from the induction wire planes in a
single-phase LArTPC is qualitatively demonstrated on MicroBooNE data with event
display images, and quantitatively demonstrated via waveform-level and
track-level metrics. Improved performance of induction plane calorimetry is
demonstrated through the agreement of extracted ionization charge measurements
across different wire planes for various event topologies. In addition to the
comprehensive waveform-level comparison of data and simulation, a calibration
of the cryogenic electronics response is presented and solutions to various
MicroBooNE-specific TPC issues are discussed. This work presents an important
improvement in LArTPC signal processing, the foundation of reconstruction and
therefore physics analyses in MicroBooNE.
