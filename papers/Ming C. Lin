Probing Hamiltonian field redefinition on the nontrivial conformal  algebra

  The compatibility between the conformal symmetry and the closure of conformalalgebras is discussed on the nonlinear sigma model. The present approach, abovethe basis of field redefinition employed in the Hamiltonian scheme, attemptsthe method of quantisation with intuitive picture. As a general field theoretictreatment, the consistency is ensured by means of the interesting featureswhich are observed in the historical studies for the gauge-invariant conformalsymmetry. The identification of conformal anomaly is also shown coincident withthe conventional one approached within the path-integral formulation.

Critical gaps of first-order phase transition in infinitely long Ising  cylinders with antiperiodically joined circumference

  Based on the analytic expression of free energy for infinitely long Isingstrip with finite width joined antiperiodically on a variety of planarlattices, we show the existence of first-order phase transition at the criticalpoint of Ising transition. The critical gaps of the transition are alsocalculated analytically by measuring the discontinuities in the internal energyand the specific heat.

Exact treatment of Ising model on the helical tori

  The exact closed forms of the partition functions of 2D Ising model on squarelattices with twisted boundary conditions are given. The constructions ofhelical tori are unambiguously related to the twisted boundary conditions byvirtue of the SL(2,Z) transforms. Numerical analyses reveal that the finitesize effect is irrelevant to the chirality equipped with each helical boundarycondition.

Partonic Effects in Heavy Ion Collisions at RHIC

  Effects of partonic interactions in heavy ion collisions at RHIC are studiedin a multiphase transport model (AMPT) that includes both initial partonic andfinal hadronic interactions.It is found that a large parton scattering crosssection is needed to understand the measured elliptic flow of pions andtwo-pion correlation function.

  An active control method of azo-polymer loaded surface plasmon-polaritons(SPPs) wave with tightly focused 532nm laser is proposed and demonstrated inthis paper. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are consistent, whichconfirm the validity of this method. The optically active control method hasthe advantage of simple samples preparation, high spatial resolution andselectively control of the SPPs wave. This optical control of SPPs wave methodhas potential applications in integrated plasmonics.

  We experimentally demonstrate a net-rate 503.61-Gbit/s discrete multitone(DMT) transmission over 10-km 7-core fiber with 1.5-\mu m single mode VCSEL,where low-complexity kernelrecursive-least-squares algorithm is employed fornonlinear channel equalization.

Measurement of photoelectron yield of the prototype for the CDEX-10  liquid argon detector

  The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) is a low background experiment atChina Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) designed to directly detect darkmatter with a high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. In the second phaseCDEX-10 with a 10 kg Germanium array detector system, the liquid argon (LAr)anti-compton active shielding and cooling system is proposed. For purpose ofstudying the properties of LAr detector, a prototype with an active volume of 7liters of liquid argon was built and operated. The photoelectron yields, as acritically important parameter for the prototype detector, have been measuredto be 0.051-0.079 p.e./keV for 662 keV Gamma lines at different positions. Thegood agreement between the experimental and simulation results has provided aquite reasonable understanding and determination of the important parameterssuch as the Surviving Fraction of the Ar2 excimers, the absorption length for128 nm photons in liquid argon, the reflectivity of Teflon and so on.

A Multi-Phase Transport Model for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions

  We describe in detail how the different components of a multi-phase transport(AMPT) model, that uses the Heavy Ion Jet Interaction Generator (HIJING) forgenerating the initial conditions, Zhang's Parton Cascade (ZPC) for modelingpartonic scatterings, the Lund string fragmentation model or a quarkcoalescence model for hadronization, and A Relativistic Transport (ART) modelfor treating hadronic scatterings, are improved and combined to give a coherentdescription of the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. We alsoexplain the way parameters in the model are determined, and discuss thesensitivity of predicted results to physical input in the model. Comparisons ofthese results to experimental data, mainly from heavy ion collisions at theRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), are then made in order to extractinformation on the properties of the hot dense matter formed in thesecollisions.

Finite-size scaling of partition function zeros and first-order phase  transition for infinitely long Ising cylinder

  The critical properties of an infinitely long Ising strip with finite width Ljoined periodically or antiperiodically are investigated by analyzing thedistribution of partition function zeros. For periodic boundary condition, thethe leading finite-size scaling of partition function zeros and its correctionsare given. For antiperiodic boundary condition, the critical point of 2D Isingtransition is one of the loci of the zeros, and the associated non-analyticityis identified as a first-order phase transition. The exact amount of the latentheat released by the transition is 4/L.

Deuteron production and elliptic flow in relativistic heavy ion  collisions

  The hadronic transport model \textsc{art} is extended to include theproduction and annihilation of deuterons via the reactions $BB \leftrightarrowdM$, where $B$ and $M$ stand for baryons and mesons, respectively, as well astheir elastic scattering with mesons and baryons in the hadronic matter. Thisnew hadronic transport model is then used to study the transverse momentumspectrum and elliptic flow of deuterons in relativistic heavy ion collisions,with the initial hadron distributions after hadronization of producedquark-gluon plasma taken from a blast wave model. The results are compared withthose measured by the PHENIX and STAR Collaborations for Au+Au collisions at$\sqrt{s_{NN}^{}} = 200$ GeV, and also with those obtained from the coalescencemodel based on freeze-out nucleons in the transport model.

Creation of Helical Dirac Fermions by Interfacing Two Gapped Systems of  Ordinary Fermions

  Topological insulators (TIs) are a unique class of materials characterized bya surface (edge) Dirac cone state of helical Dirac fermions in the middle ofbulk (surface) gap. When the thickness (width) of TIs is reduced, however,interaction between the surface (edge) states will open a gap removing theDirac cone. Using density function theory calculation, we demonstrate thecreation of helical Dirac fermions from interfacing two gapped TI films, asingle bilayer Bi grown on a single quintuple layer Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3. Thetheoretical prediction is directly confirmed by experiment. We further showthat the extrinsic helical Dirac fermions consists of predominantly Bi bilayerstates, which are created by a giant Rashba effect due to interfacial chargetransfer. Our findings provide a promising new method to create novel TImaterials by interface engineering.

Estimating Traffic Conditions At Metropolitan Scale Using Traffic Flow  Theory

  The rapid urbanization and increasing traffic have serious social, economic,and environmental impact on metropolitan areas worldwide. It is of a greatimportance to understand the complex interplay of road networks and trafficconditions. The authors propose a novel framework to estimate trafficconditions at the metropolitan scale using GPS traces. Their approach beginswith an initial estimation of network travel times by solving a convexoptimization program based on traffic flow theory. Then, they iterativelyrefine the estimated network travel times and vehicle traversed paths. Last,the authors perform a bilevel optimization process to estimate trafficconditions on road segments that are not covered by GPS data. The evaluationand comparison of the authors' approach over two state-of-the-art methods showup to 96.57% relative improvements. The authors have further conducted fieldtests by coupling road networks of San Francisco and Beijing with real-worldGIS data, which involve 128,701 nodes, 148,899 road segments, and over 26million GPS traces.

LSwarm: Efficient Collision Avoidance for Large Swarms with Coverage  Constraints in Complex Urban Scenes

  In this paper, we address the problem of collision avoidance for a swarm ofUAVs used for continuous surveillance of an urban environment. Our method,LSwarm, efficiently avoids collisions with static obstacles, dynamic obstaclesand other agents in 3-D urban environments while considering coverageconstraints. LSwarm computes collision avoiding velocities that (i) maximizethe conformity of an agent to an optimal path given by a global coveragestrategy and (ii) ensure sufficient resolution of the coverage data collectedby each agent. Our algorithm is formulated based on ORCA (Optimal ReciprocalCollision Avoidance) and is scalable with respect to the size of the swarm. Weevaluate the coverage performance of LSwarm in realistic simulations of a swarmof quadrotors in complex urban models. In practice, our approach can computecollision avoiding velocities for a swarm composed of tens to hundreds ofagents in a few milliseconds on dense urban scenes consisting of tens ofbuildings.

Quasiparticle Dynamics in Reshaped Helical Dirac Cone of Topological  Insulators

  Topological insulators (TIs) and graphene present two unique classes ofmaterials which are characterized by spin polarized (helical) and non-polarizedDirac-cone band structures, respectively. The importance of many-bodyinteractions that renormalize the linear bands near Dirac point in graphene hasbeen well recognized and attracted much recent attention. However,renormalization of the helical Dirac point has not been observed in TIs. Here,we report the experimental observation of the renormalized quasi-particlespectrum with a skewed Dirac cone in a single Bi bilayer grown on Bi2Te3substrate, from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. First-principlesband calculations indicate that the quasi-particle spectra are likelyassociated with the hybridization between the extrinsic substrate-induced Diracstates of Bi bilayer and the intrinsic surface Dirac states of Bi2Te3 film atclose energy proximity. Without such hybridization, only single-particle Diracspectra are observed in a single Bi bilayer grown on Bi2Se3, where theextrinsic Dirac states Bi bilayer and the intrinsic Dirac states of Bi2Se3 arewell separated in energy. The possible origins of many-body interactions arediscussed. Our findings provide a means to manipulate topological surfacestates.

Detailed Garment Recovery from a Single-View Image

  Most recent garment capturing techniques rely on acquiring multiple views ofclothing, which may not always be readily available, especially in the case ofpre-existing photographs from the web. As an alternative, we pro- pose a methodthat is able to compute a rich and realistic 3D model of a human body and itsoutfits from a single photograph with little human in- teraction. Our algorithmis not only able to capture the global shape and geometry of the clothing, itcan also extract small but important details of cloth, such as occludedwrinkles and folds. Unlike previous methods using full 3D information (i.e.depth, multi-view images, or sampled 3D geom- etry), our approach achievesdetailed garment recovery from a single-view image by using statistical,geometric, and physical priors and a combina- tion of parameter estimation,semantic parsing, shape recovery, and physics- based cloth simulation. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by re-purposing thereconstructed garments for virtual try-on and garment transfer applications, aswell as cloth animation for digital characters.

Low-mass dark matter search results from full exposure of PandaX-I  experiment

  We report the results of a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) darkmatter search using the full 80.1\;live-day exposure of the first stage of thePandaX experiment (PandaX-I) located in the China Jin-Ping UndergroundLaboratory. The PandaX-I detector has been optimized for detecting low-massWIMPs, achieving a photon detection efficiency of 9.6\%. With a fiducial liquidxenon target mass of 54.0\,kg, no significant excess event were found above theexpected background. A profile likelihood analysis confirms our earlier findingthat the PandaX-I data disfavor all positive low-mass WIMP signals reported inthe literature under standard assumptions. A stringent bound on the low massWIMP is set at WIMP mass below 10\,GeV/c$^2$, demonstrating that liquid xenondetectors can be competitive for low-mass WIMP searches.

Plasmoid ejection and secondary current sheet generation from magnetic  reconnection in laser-plasma interaction

  Reconnection of the self-generated magnetic fields in laser-plasmainteraction was first investigated experimentally by Nilson {\it et al.} [Phys.Rev. Lett. 97, 255001 (2006)] by shining two laser pulses a distance apart on asolid target layer. An elongated current sheet (CS) was observed in the plasmabetween the two laser spots. In order to more closely model magnetotailreconnection, here two side-by-side thin target layers, instead of a singleone, are used. It is found that at one end of the elongated CS a fan-likeelectron outflow region including three well-collimated electron jets appears.The ($>1$ MeV) tail of the jet energy distribution exhibits a power-lawscaling. The enhanced electron acceleration is attributed to the intenseinductive electric field in the narrow electron dominated reconnection region,as well as additional acceleration as they are trapped inside the rapidlymoving plasmoid formed in and ejected from the CS. The ejection also induces asecondary CS.

A novel artificial condensed matter lattice and a new platform for  one-dimensional topological phases

  Engineered lattices in condensed matter physics, such as cold atom opticallattices or photonic crystals, can have fundamentally different properties fromnaturally-occurring electronic crystals. Here, we report a novel type ofartificial quantum matter lattice. Our lattice is a multilayer heterostructurebuilt from alternating thin films of topological and trivial insulators. Eachinterface within the heterostructure hosts a set of topologically-protectedinterface states, and by making the layers sufficiently thin, we demonstratefor the first time a hybridization of interface states across layers. In thisway, our heterostructure forms an emergent atomic chain, where the interfacesact as lattice sites and the interface states act as atomic orbitals, as seenfrom our measurements by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Bychanging the composition of the heterostructure, we can directly controlhopping between lattice sites. We realize a topological and a trivial phase inour superlattice band structure. We argue that the superlattice may becharacterized in a significant way by a one-dimensional topological invariant,closely related to the invariant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Ourtopological insulator heterostructure demonstrates a novel experimentalplatform where we can engineer band structures by directly controlling howelectrons hop between lattice sites.

JINGLE, a JCMT legacy survey of dust and gas for galaxy evolution  studies: I. Survey overview and first results

  JINGLE is a new JCMT legacy survey designed to systematically study the coldinterstellar medium of galaxies in the local Universe. As part of the survey weperform 850um continuum measurements with SCUBA-2 for a representative sampleof 193 Herschel-selected galaxies with M*>10^9Msun, as well as integratedCO(2-1) line fluxes with RxA3m for a subset of 90 of these galaxies. The sampleis selected from fields covered by the Herschel-ATLAS survey that are alsotargeted by the MaNGA optical integral-field spectroscopic survey. The new JCMTobservations combined with the multi-wavelength ancillary data will allow forthe robust characterization of the properties of dust in the nearby Universe,and the benchmarking of scaling relations between dust, gas, and global galaxyproperties. In this paper we give an overview of the survey objectives anddetails about the sample selection and JCMT observations, present a consistent30 band UV-to-FIR photometric catalog with derived properties, and introducethe JINGLE Main Data Release (MDR). Science highlights include thenon-linearity of the relation between 850um luminosity and CO line luminosity,and the serendipitous discovery of candidate z>6 galaxies.

Search for Baryon and Lepton Number Violation in  $J/Ï\toÎ_c^+e^-+c.c.$

  Using $1.31\times10^9$ $J/\psi$ events collected by the BESIII detector atthe Beijing Electron Positron Collider, we search for the process$J/\psi\to\Lambda_c^+e^-+c.c.$ for the first time. In this process, both baryonand lepton number conservation is violated. No signal is found and the upperlimit on the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to\Lambda_c^+e^-+c.c.)$ isset to be $6.9\times10^{-8}$ at the 90\% Confidence Level.

Measurements of absolute branching fractions for $D$ mesons decays into  two pseudoscalar mesons

  Using a data sample of $e^+e^-$ collision data with an integrated luminosityof 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ taken at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s= 3.773$~GeV withthe BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage rings, we measure theabsolute branching fractions of the two-body hadronic decays $D^+\to\pi^+\pi^0$, $K^+ \pi^0$, $\pi^+ \eta$, $K^+\eta$, $\pi^+\eta^\prime$,$K^+\eta^\prime$, $K_S^0 \pi^+$, $K_S^0 K^+$, and $D^0\to \pi^+ \pi^-$, $K^+K^-$, $K^\mp \pi^\pm$, $K_S^0 \pi^0$, $K_S^0 \eta$, $K_S^0 \eta^\prime$. Ourresults are consistent with previous measurements within uncertainties. Amongthem, the branching fractions for $D^+\to\pi^+\pi^0$, $K^+\pi^0$, $\pi^+\eta$,$\pi^+\eta^\prime$, $K_S^0 \pi^+$, $K_S^0 K^+$ and $D^0 \to K_S^0 \pi^0$,$K_S^0 \eta$, $K_S^0 \eta^\prime$ are determined with improved precisioncompared to the world average values.

First low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals

  In this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on Virgo VSR2 andVSR4 data. The search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 Hz and128 Hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ Hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ Hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. The startingpoint was a set of short Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. Aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. On each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the FrequencyHough transform inan incoherent step. Only coincident candidates among VSR2 and VSR4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. The criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. Selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer FFTs followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. No evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint VSR2-VSR4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 Hz and 128 Hz. This is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 Hz. We setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. Our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{Hz}$.

A search of the Orion spur for continuous gravitational waves using a  "loosely coherent" algorithm on data from LIGO interferometers

  We report results of a wideband search for periodic gravitational waves fromisolated neutron stars within the Orion spur towards both the inner and outerregions of our Galaxy. As gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter,the search is unimpeded by dust and concentrations of stars. One search disk(A) is $6.87^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$20^\textrm{h}10^\textrm{m}54.71^\textrm{s}+33^\circ33'25.29"$, and the other(B) is $7.45^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$8^\textrm{h}35^\textrm{m}20.61^\textrm{s}-46^\circ49'25.151"$. We explored thefrequency range of 50-1500 Hz and frequency derivative from $0$ to $-5\times10^{-9}$ Hz/s. A multi-stage, loosely coherent search program allowed probingmore deeply than before in these two regions, while increasing coherence lengthwith every stage.  Rigorous followup parameters have winnowed initial coincidence set to only 70candidates, to be examined manually. None of those 70 candidates proved to beconsistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 95% confidencelevel upper limits were placed on continuous-wave strain amplitudes. Near $169$Hz we achieve our lowest 95% CL upper limit on worst-case linearly polarizedstrain amplitude $h_0$ of $6.3\times 10^{-25}$, while at the high end of ourfrequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of $3.4\times 10^{-24}$ forall polarizations and sky locations.

Narrow-band search of continuous gravitational-wave signals from Crab  and Vela pulsars in Virgo VSR4 data

  In this paper we present the results of a coherent narrow-band search forcontinuous gravitational-wave signals from the Crab and Vela pulsars conductedon Virgo VSR4 data. In order to take into account a possible small mismatchbetween the gravitational wave frequency and two times the star rotationfrequency, inferred from measurement of the electromagnetic pulse rate, a rangeof 0.02 Hz around two times the star rotational frequency has been searched forboth the pulsars. No evidence for a signal has been found and 95$\%$ confidencelevel upper limits have been computed both assuming polarization parameters arecompletely unknown and that they are known with some uncertainty, as derivedfrom X-ray observations of the pulsar wind torii. For Vela the upper limits arecomparable to the spin-down limit, computed assuming that all the observedspin-down is due to the emission of gravitational waves. For Crab the upperlimits are about a factor of two below the spin-down limit, and represent asignificant improvement with respect to past analysis. This is the first timethe spin-down limit is significantly overcome in a narrow-band search.

A directed search for gravitational waves from Scorpius X-1 with initial  LIGO

  We present results of a search for continuously-emitted gravitationalradiation, directed at the brightest low-mass X-ray binary, Scorpius X-1. Oursemi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of LIGO S5 data ranging from 50-550 Hz,and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic powerdistributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. All candidates notremoved at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% falsealarm rate. We present Bayesian 95% confidence upper limits ongravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: astandard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of ScorpiusX-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagneticobservations. Median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at150 Hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. This proofof principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknowneffects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, butimproves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.

Searches for continuous gravitational waves from nine young supernova  remnants

  We describe directed searches for continuous gravitational waves in data fromthe sixth LIGO science data run. The targets were nine young supernova remnantsnot associated with pulsars; eight of the remnants are associated withnon-pulsing suspected neutron stars. One target's parameters are uncertainenough to warrant two searches, for a total of ten. Each search covered a broadband of frequencies and first and second frequency derivatives for a fixed skydirection. The searches coherently integrated data from the two LIGOinterferometers over time spans from 5.3-25.3 days using the matched-filteringF-statistic. We found no credible gravitational-wave signals. We set 95%confidence upper limits as strong (low) as $4\times10^{-25}$ on intrinsicstrain, $2\times10^{-7}$ on fiducial ellipticity, and $4\times10^{-5}$ onr-mode amplitude. These beat the indirect limits from energy conservation andare within the range of theoretical predictions for neutron-star ellipticitiesand r-mode amplitudes.

A gravitational-wave standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant

  The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagneticwaves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17August 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strongsignal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 secondsafter the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a regionof the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of thegravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by opticalastronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transientsignal within $\sim 10$ arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messengerobservations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, thegravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure theHubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate ofthe Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamentalimportance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the sourceinferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocityinferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. Thisapproach does not require any form of cosmic "distance ladder;" thegravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance outto cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomicaldistance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be$70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0} \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$(maximum a posteriori and 68% credible interval). This is consistent withexisting measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additionalstandard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provideprecision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.

The DESI Experiment Part I: Science,Targeting, and Survey Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based darkenergy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and thegrowth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxyand quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution,spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. Wewill measure luminous red galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out toeven higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies upto $z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlyingdark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 < z < 3.5$), for theLy-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used totrace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficientobservations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct amagnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 milliongalaxies with a median $z\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxyand quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determinethe matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.

The DESI Experiment Part II: Instrument Design

  DESI (Dark Energy Spectropic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based darkenergy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations and the growthof structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy andquasar redshift survey. The DESI instrument is a robotically-actuated,fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking up to 5,000 simultaneous spectra overa wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The fibers feed ten three-armspectrographs with resolution $R= \lambda/\Delta\lambda$ between 2000 and 5500,depending on wavelength. The DESI instrument will be used to conduct afive-year survey designed to cover 14,000 deg$^2$. This powerful instrumentwill be installed at prime focus on the 4-m Mayall telescope in Kitt Peak,Arizona, along with a new optical corrector, which will provide a three-degreediameter field of view. The DESI collaboration will also deliver aspectroscopic pipeline and data management system to reduce and archive alldata for eventual public use.

Localization and broadband follow-up of the gravitational-wave transient  GW150914

  A gravitational-wave (GW) transient was identified in data recorded by theAdvanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectorson 2015 September 14. The event, initially designated G184098 and later giventhe name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement,preliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the eventwere shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared,X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground- and space-based facilities. Inthis Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present thesky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize thefollow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray CoordinatesNetwork circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GWsky localization coverage, the timeline and depth of the observations. As thisevent turned out to be a binary black hole merger, there is little expectationof a detectable electromagnetic (EM) signature. Nevertheless, this firstbroadband campaign to search for a counterpart of an Advanced LIGO sourcerepresents a milestone and highlights the broad capabilities of the transientastronomy community and the observing strategies that have been developed topursue neutron star binary merger events. Detailed investigations of the EMdata and results of the EM follow-up campaign are being disseminated in papersby the individual teams.
