Infusing Collaborative Recommenders with Distributed Representations

  Recommender systems assist users in navigating complex information spaces andfocus their attention on the content most relevant to their needs. Often thesesystems rely on user activity or descriptions of the content. Social annotationsystems, in which users collaboratively assign tags to items, provide anothermeans to capture information about users and items. Each of these data sourcesprovides unique benefits, capturing different relationships.  In this paper, we propose leveraging multiple sources of data: ratings dataas users report their affinity toward an item, tagging data as users assignannotations to items, and item data collected from an online database. Takentogether, these datasets provide the opportunity to learn rich distributedrepresentations by exploiting recent advances in neural network architectures.We first produce representations that subjectively capture interestingrelationships among the data. We then empirically evaluate the utility of therepresentations to predict a user's rating on an item and show that itoutperforms more traditional representations. Finally, we demonstrate thattraditional representations can be combined with representations trainedthrough a neural network to achieve even better results.
