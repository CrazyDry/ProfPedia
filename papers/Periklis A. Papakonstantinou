Width-parameterized SAT: Time-Space Tradeoffs

  Width parameterizations of SAT, such as tree-width and path-width, enable thestudy of computationally more tractable and practical SAT instances. We givetwo simple algorithms. One that runs simultaneously in time-space$(O^*(2^{2tw(\phi)}), O^*(2^{tw(\phi)}))$ and another that runs in time-space$(O^*(3^{tw(\phi)\log{|\phi|}}),|\phi|^{O(1)})$, where $tw(\phi)$ is thetree-width of a formula $\phi$ with $|\phi|$ many clauses and variables. Thispartially answers the question of Alekhnovitch and Razborov, who also gavealgorithms exponential both in time and space, and asked whether the space canbe made smaller. We conjecture that every algorithm for this problem that runsin time $2^{tw(\phi)\mathbf{o(\log{|\phi|})}}$ necessarily blows up the spaceto exponential in $tw(\phi)$.  We introduce a novel way to combine the two simple algorithms that allows usto trade \emph{constant} factors in the exponents between running time andspace. Our technique gives rise to a family of algorithms controlled by twoparameters. By fixing one parameter we obtain an algorithm that runs intime-space $(O^*(3^{1.441(1-\epsilon)tw(\phi)\log{|\phi|}}), O^*(2^{2\epsilontw(\phi)}))$, for every $0<\epsilon<1$. We systematically study the limitationsof this technique, and show that these algorithmic results are the bestachievable using this technique.  We also study further the computational complexity of width parameterizationsof SAT. We prove non-sparsification lower bounds for formulas of path-width$\omega(\log|\phi|)$, and a separation between the complexity of path-width andtree-width parametrized SAT modulo plausible complexity assumptions.
