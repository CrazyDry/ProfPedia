Multicommodity Flow Algorithms for Buffered Global Routing

  In this paper we describe a new algorithm for buffered global routingaccording to a prescribed buffer site map. Specifically, we describe a provablygood multi-commodity flow based algorithm that finds a global routingminimizing buffer and wire congestion subject to given constraints on routingarea (wirelength and number of buffers) and sink delays. Our algorithm allowscomputing the tradeoff curve between routing area and wire/buffer congestionunder any combination of delay and capacity constraints, and simultaneouslyperforms buffer/wire sizing, as well as layer and pin assignment. Experimentalresults show that near-optimal results are obtained with a practical runtime.

Asymmetric binary covering codes

  An asymmetric binary covering code of length n and radius R is a subset C ofthe n-cube Q_n such that every vector x in Q_n can be obtained from some vectorc in C by changing at most R 1's of c to 0's, where R is as small as possible.K^+(n,R) is defined as the smallest size of such a code. We show K^+(n,R) is oforder 2^n/n^R for constant R, using an asymmetric sphere-covering bound andprobabilistic methods. We show K^+(n,n-R')=R'+1 for constant coradius R' iffn>=R'(R'+1)/2. These two results are extended to near-constant R and R',respectively. Various bounds on K^+ are given in terms of the total number of0's or 1's in a minimal code. The dimension of a minimal asymmetric linearbinary code ([n,R]^+ code) is determined to be min(0,n-R). We conclude bydiscussing open problems and techniques to compute explicit values for K^+,giving a table of best known bounds.
