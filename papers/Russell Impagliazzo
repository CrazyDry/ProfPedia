Hardness as randomness: a survey of universal derandomization

  We survey recent developments in the study of probabilistic complexityclasses. While the evidence seems to support the conjecture that probabilismcan be deterministically simulated with relatively low overhead, i.e., that$P=BPP$, it also indicates that this may be a difficult question to resolve. Infact, proving that probabilistic algorithms have non-trivial deterministicsimulations is basically equivalent to proving circuit lower bounds, either inthe algebraic or Boolean models.

An Entropic Proof of Chang's Inequality

  Chang's lemma is a useful tool in additive combinatorics and the analysis ofBoolean functions. Here we give an elementary proof using entropy. The constantwe obtain is tight, and we give a slight improvement in the case where thevariables are highly biased.

Constant-Depth Frege Systems with Counting Axioms Polynomially Simulate  Nullstellensatz Refutations

  We show that constant-depth Frege systems with counting axioms modulo $m$polynomially simulate Nullstellensatz refutations modulo $m$. Central to thisis a new definition of reducibility from formulas to systems of polynomialswith the property that, for most previously studied translations of formulas tosystems of polynomials, a formula reduces to its translation. When combinedwith a previous result of the authors, this establishes the first sizeseparation between Nullstellensatz and polynomial calculus refutations. We alsoobtain new, small refutations for certain CNFs by constant-depth Frege systemswith counting axioms.

0-1 Integer Linear Programming with a Linear Number of Constraints

  We give an exact algorithm for the 0-1 Integer Linear Programming problemwith a linear number of constraints that improves over exhaustive search by anexponential factor. Specifically, our algorithm runs in time$2^{(1-\text{poly}(1/c))n}$ where n is the number of variables and cn is thenumber of constraints. The key idea for the algorithm is a reduction to theVector Domination problem and a new algorithm for that subproblem.

A Satisfiability Algorithm for AC$^0$

  We consider the problem of efficiently enumerating the satisfying assignmentsto $\AC^0$ circuits. We give a zero-error randomized algorithm which takes an$\AC^0$ circuit as input and constructs a set of restrictions which partition$\{0,1\}^n$ so that under each restriction the value of the circuit isconstant. Let $d$ denote the depth of the circuit and $cn$ denote the number ofgates. This algorithm runs in time $|C| 2^{n(1-\mu_{c.d})}$ where $|C|$ is thesize of the circuit for $\mu_{c,d} \ge 1/\bigO[\lg c + d \lg d]^{d-1}$ withprobability at least $1-2^{-n}$.  As a result, we get improved exponential time algorithms for $\AC^0$ circuitsatisfiability and for counting solutions. In addition, we get an improvedbound on the correlation of $\AC^0$ circuits with parity.  As an important component of our analysis, we extend the H{\aa}stad SwitchingLemma to handle multiple $\kcnf$s and $\kdnf$s.

A Satisfiability Algorithm for Sparse Depth Two Threshold Circuits

  We give a nontrivial algorithm for the satisfiability problem for cn-wirethreshold circuits of depth two which is better than exhaustive search by afactor 2^{sn} where s= 1/c^{O(c^2)}. We believe that this is the firstnontrivial satisfiability algorithm for cn-wire threshold circuits of depthtwo. The independently interesting problem of the feasibility of sparse 0-1integer linear programs is a special case. To our knowledge, our algorithm isthe first to achieve constant savings even for the special case of IntegerLinear Programming. The key idea is to reduce the satisfiability problem to theVector Domination Problem, the problem of checking whether there are twovectors in a given collection of vectors such that one dominates the othercomponent-wise.  We also provide a satisfiability algorithm with constant savings for depthtwo circuits with symmetric gates where the total weighted fan-in is at mostcn.  One of our motivations is proving strong lower bounds for TC^0 circuits,exploiting the connection (established by Williams) between satisfiabilityalgorithms and lower bounds. Our second motivation is to explore the connectionbetween the expressive power of the circuits and the complexity of thecorresponding circuit satisfiability problem.

Stabbing Planes

  We introduce and develop a new semi-algebraic proof system, called StabbingPlanes that is in the style of DPLL-based modern SAT solvers. As with DPLL,there is only one rule: the current polytope can be subdivided by branching onan inequality and its "integer negation." That is, we can (nondeterministicallychoose) a hyperplane a x \geq b with integer coefficients, which partitions thepolytope into three pieces: the points in the polytope satisfying a x \geq b,the points satisfying a x \leq b-1, and the middle slab b-1 < a x < b. Sincethe middle slab contains no integer points it can be safely discarded, and thealgorithm proceeds recursively on the other two branches. Each path terminateswhen the current polytope is empty, which is polynomial-time checkable. Amongour results, we show somewhat surprisingly that Stabbing Planes can efficientlysimulate Cutting Planes, and moreover, is strictly stronger than Cutting Planesunder a reasonable conjecture. We prove linear lower bounds on the rank ofStabbing Planes refutations, by adapting a lifting argument in communicationcomplexity.

AM with Multiple Merlins

  We introduce and study a new model of interactive proofs: AM(k), orArthur-Merlin with k non-communicating Merlins. Unlike with the better-knownMIP, here the assumption is that each Merlin receives an independent randomchallenge from Arthur. One motivation for this model (which we explore indetail) comes from the close analogies between it and the quantum complexityclass QMA(k), but the AM(k) model is also natural in its own right.  We illustrate the power of multiple Merlins by giving an AM(2) protocol for3SAT, in which the Merlins' challenges and responses consist of onlyn^{1/2+o(1)} bits each. Our protocol has the consequence that, assuming theExponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), any algorithm for approximating a dense CSPwith a polynomial-size alphabet must take n^{(log n)^{1-o(1)}} time. Algorithmsnearly matching this lower bound are known, but their running times had neverbeen previously explained. Brandao and Harrow have also recently used our 3SATprotocol to show quasipolynomial hardness for approximating the values ofcertain entangled games.  In the other direction, we give a simple quasipolynomial-time approximationalgorithm for free games, and use it to prove that, assuming the ETH, our 3SATprotocol is essentially optimal. More generally, we show that multiple Merlinsnever provide more than a polynomial advantage over one: that is, AM(k)=AM forall k=poly(n). The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games,which follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. onsubsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can beclosely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame.

Strong ETH Breaks With Merlin and Arthur: Short Non-Interactive Proofs  of Batch Evaluation

  We present an efficient proof system for Multipoint Arithmetic CircuitEvaluation: for every arithmetic circuit $C(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of size $s$ anddegree $d$ over a field ${\mathbb F}$, and any inputs $a_1,\ldots,a_K \in{\mathbb F}^n$,  $\bullet$ the Prover sends the Verifier the values $C(a_1), \ldots, C(a_K)\in {\mathbb F}$ and a proof of $\tilde{O}(K \cdot d)$ length, and  $\bullet$ the Verifier tosses $\textrm{poly}(\log(dK|{\mathbbF}|/\varepsilon))$ coins and can check the proof in about $\tilde{O}(K \cdot(n+ d) + s)$ time, with probability of error less than $\varepsilon$.  For small degree $d$, this "Merlin-Arthur" proof system (a.k.a. MA-proofsystem) runs in nearly-linear time, and has many applications. For example, weobtain MA-proof systems that run in $c^{n}$ time (for various $c < 2$) for thePermanent, $\#$Circuit-SAT for all sublinear-depth circuits, countingHamiltonian cycles, and infeasibility of $0$-$1$ linear programs. In general,the value of any polynomial in Valiant's class ${\sf VP}$ can be certifiedfaster than "exhaustive summation" over all possible assignments. These resultsstrongly refute a Merlin-Arthur Strong ETH and Arthur-Merlin Strong ETH posedby Russell Impagliazzo and others.  We also give a three-round (AMA) proof system for quantified Boolean formulasrunning in $2^{2n/3+o(n)}$ time, nearly-linear time MA-proof systems forcounting orthogonal vectors in a collection and finding Closest Pairs in theHamming metric, and a MA-proof system running in $n^{k/2+O(1)}$-time forcounting $k$-cliques in graphs.  We point to some potential future directions for refuting theNondeterministic Strong ETH.
