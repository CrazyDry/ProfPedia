Efficient 4.42 Î¼m Raman laser based on hollow-core silica fiber

  In this paper we consider mid-infrared Raman lasers based on gas-filledhollow-core silica fibers and provide theoretical and experimental analysis offactors that limit the efficiency and output power of these lasers. As aresult, we realized an efficient ns-pulsed 4.42 {\mu}m Raman laser based on an1H2-filled revolver silica fiber. Quantum efficiency as high as 36 % isachieved, and output average power as high as 250 mW is demonstrated. Thepossibilities of further improving the laser efficiency are discussed.

Online, interactive user guidance for high-dimensional, constrained  motion planning

  We consider the problem of planning a collision-free path for ahigh-dimensional robot. Specifically, we suggest a planning framework where amotion-planning algorithm can obtain guidance from a user. In contrast toexisting approaches that try to speed up planning by incorporating experiencesor demonstrations ahead of planning, we suggest to seek user guidance only whenthe planner identifies that it ceases to make significant progress towards thegoal. Guidance is provided in the form of an intermediate configuration$\hat{q}$, which is used to bias the planner to go through $\hat{q}$. Wedemonstrate our approach for the case where the planning algorithm isMulti-Heuristic A* (MHA*) and the robot is a 34-DOF humanoid. We show that ourapproach allows to compute highly-constrained paths with little domainknowledge. Without our approach, solving such problems requirescarefully-crafting domain-dependent heuristics.

A Single-Planner Approach to Multi-Modal Humanoid Mobility

  In this work, we present an approach to planning for humanoid mobility.Humanoid mobility is a challenging problem, as the configuration space for ahumanoid robot is intractably large, especially if the robot is capable ofperforming many types of locomotion. For example, a humanoid robot may be ableto perform such tasks as bipedal walking, crawling, and climbing. Our approachis to plan for all these tasks within a single search process. This allows thesearch to reason about all the capabilities of the robot at any point, and toderive the complete solution such that the plan is guaranteed to be feasible. Akey observation is that we often can roughly decompose a mobility task into asequence of smaller tasks, and focus planning efforts to reason over muchsmaller search spaces. To this end, we leverage the results of a recentlydeveloped framework for planning with adaptive dimensionality, and incorporatethe capabilities of available controllers directly into the planning process.The resulting planner can also be run in an interleaved fashion alongsideexecution so that time spent idle is much reduced.

Provable Infinite-Horizon Real-Time Planning for Repetitive Tasks

  In manufacturing and automation settings, robots often have to performhighly-repetitive manipulation tasks in structured environments. In this workwe are interested in settings where tasks are similar, yet not identical (e.g.,due to uncertain orientation of objects) and motion planning needs to beextremely fast. Preprocessing-based approaches prove to be very beneficial inthese settings; they analyze the configuration-space offline to generate someauxiliary information which can then be used in the query phase to speedupplanning times. Typically, the tighter the requirement is on query times thelarger the memory footprint will be. In particular, for high-dimensionalspaces, providing real-time planning capabilities is extremely challenging.While there are planners that guarantee real-time performance by limiting theplanning horizon, we are not aware of general-purpose planners capable of doingit for infinite horizon (i.e., planning to the goal). To this end, we propose apreprocessing-based method that provides provable bounds on the query timewhile incurring only a small amount of memory overhead in the query phase. Weevaluate our method on a 7-DOF robot arm and show a speedup of over tenfold inquery time when compared to the PRM algorithm, while provably guaranteeing amaximum query time of less than 3 milliseconds.

A Homotopy-like Class Invariant for Sub-manifolds of Punctured Euclidean  Spaces

  We consider the $D$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\mathbb{R}^D$, with certain$(D-N)$-dimensional compact, closed and orientable sub-manifolds (which we call\emph{singularity manifolds} and represent by $\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}$)removed from it. We define and investigate the problem of finding ahomotopy-like class invariant ($\chi$-homotopy) for certain $(N-1)$-dimensionalcompact, closed and orientable sub-manifolds (which we call \emph{candidatemanifolds} and represent by $\omega$) of $\mathbb{R}^D \setminus\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}$, with special emphasis on computational aspects of theproblem. We determine a differential $(N-1)$-form,$\psi_{\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}}$, such that$\chi_{\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}}(\omega) = \int_\omega\psi_{\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}}$ is a class invariant for such candidatemanifolds. We show that the formula agrees with formulae from Cauchy integraltheorem and Residue theorem of complex analysis (when $D=2,N=2$), Biot-Savartlaw and Ampere's law of theory of electromagnetism (when $D=3,N=2$), and theGauss divergence theorem (when $D=3,N=3$), and discover that the underlyingequivalence relation suggested by each of these well-known theorems is the$\chi$-homotopy of sub-manifolds of these low dimensional punctured Euclideanspaces. We describe numerical techniques for computing$\psi_{\widetilde{\mathcal{S}}}$ and its integral on $\omega$, and givenumerical validations of the proposed theory for a problem in a 5-dimensionalEuclidean space. We also discuss a specific application from \emph{robot pathplanning problem}, when N=2, and describe a method for computing least costpaths with homotopy class constraints using \emph{graph search techniques}.

PERCH: Perception via Search for Multi-Object Recognition and  Localization

  In many robotic domains such as flexible automated manufacturing or personalassistance, a fundamental perception task is that of identifying and localizingobjects whose 3D models are known. Canonical approaches to this problem includediscriminative methods that find correspondences between feature descriptorscomputed over the model and observed data. While these methods have beenemployed successfully, they can be unreliable when the feature descriptors failto capture variations in observed data; a classic cause being occlusion. As astep towards deliberative reasoning, we present PERCH: PErception via SeaRCH,an algorithm that seeks to find the best explanation of the observed sensordata by hypothesizing possible scenes in a generative fashion. Ourcontributions are: i) formulating the multi-object recognition and localizationtask as an optimization problem over the space of hypothesized scenes, ii)exploiting structure in the optimization to cast it as a combinatorial searchproblem on what we call the Monotone Scene Generation Tree, and iii) leveragingparallelization and recent advances in multi-heuristic search in makingcombinatorial search tractable. We prove that our system can guaranteedlyproduce the best explanation of the scene under the chosen cost function, andvalidate our claims on real world RGB-D test data. Our experimental resultsshow that we can identify and localize objects under heavy occlusion--caseswhere state-of-the-art methods struggle.

Effective Footstep Planning Using Homotopy-Class Guidance

  Planning the motion for humanoid robots is a computationally-complex task dueto the high dimensionality of the system. Thus, a common approach is to firstplan in the low-dimensional space induced by the robot's feet---a task referredto as footstep planning. This low-dimensional plan is then used to guide thefull motion of the robot. One approach that has proven successful in footstepplanning is using search-based planners such as A* and its many variants. To doso, these search-based planners have to be endowed with effective heuristics toefficiently guide them through the search space. However, designing effectiveheuristics is a time-consuming task that requires the user to have good domainknowledge. Thus, our goal is to be able to effectively plan the footstepmotions taken by a humanoid robot while obviating the burden on the user tocarefully design local-minima free heuristics. To this end, we propose to useuser-defined homotopy classes in the workspace that are intuitive to define.These homotopy classes are used to automatically generate heuristic functionsthat efficiently guide the footstep planner. Additionally, we present anextension to homotopy classes such that they are applicable to complexmulti-level environments. We compare our approach for footstep planning with astandard approach that uses a heuristic common to footstep planning. In simplescenarios, the performance of both algorithms is comparable. However, in morecomplex scenarios our approach allows for a speedup in planning of severalorders of magnitude when compared to the standard approach.
