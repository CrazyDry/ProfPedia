Practical Rate and Route Adaptation with Efficient Link Quality  Estimation for IEEE 802.11b/g Multi-Hop Networks

  Accurate and fast packet delivery rate (PDR) estimation, used in evaluatingwireless link quality, is a prerequisite to increase the performance of mobile,multi-hop and multi-rate wireless ad hoc networks. Unfortunately, contemporaryPDR estimation methods, i.e. beacon-based packet counting in EstimatedTransmission Time and Expected Transmission Count metrics, have unsatisfactoryperformance. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel PDR estimation methodbased on SNR profiles. We classify all possible link quality estimation methodsand compare them analytically against our design. Results show that it leads toa more efficient link quality estimation. Further investigations with theprototype implementation of our method in IEEE 802.11b/g testbeds reveal thatthe accuracy of PDR estimation in mobile scenarios can be improved up to 50% incomparison to generic packet-based PDR. Experiments with the same prototype onlink and routing layers for different measurement scenarios show that it leadsto a better rate adaptation and route selection in the form of end-to-endthroughput increase compared to traditional packet counting methods.

Using Social Information for Flow Allocation in MANETs

  Adhoc networks enable communication between distributed, mobile wirelessnodes without any supporting infrastructure. In the absence of centralizedcontrol, such networks require node interaction, and are inherently based oncooperation between nodes. In this paper, we use social and behavioral trust ofnodes to form a flow allocation optimization problem. We initialize trust usinginformation gained from users' social relationships (from social networks) andupdate the trusts metric over time based on observed node behaviors. We conductanalysis of social trust using real data sets and used it as a parameter forperformance evaluation of our frame work in ns-3. Based on our approach weobtain a significant improvement in both detection rate and packet deliveryratio using social trust information when compared to behavioral trust alone.Further, we observe that social trust is critical in the event of mobility andplays a crucial role in bootstrapping the computation of trust.

Trust Exploitation and Attention Competition: A Game Theoretical Model

  The proliferation of Social Network Sites (SNSs) has greatly reformed the wayof information dissemination, but also provided a new venue for hosts withimpure motivations to disseminate malicious information. Social trust is thebasis for information dissemination in SNSs. Malicious hosts judiciously anddynamically make the balance between maintaining its social trust and selfishlymaximizing its malicious gain over a long time-span. Studying the optimalresponse strategies for each malicious host could assist to design the bestsystem maneuver so as to achieve the targeted level of overall maliciousactivities. In this paper, we propose an interaction-based social trust model,and formulate the maximization of long-term malicious gains of multiplecompeting hosts as a non-cooperative differential game. Through rigorousanalysis, optimal response strategies are identified and the best systemmaneuver mechanism is presented. Extensive numerical studies further verify theanalytical results.

FlowIntent: Detecting Privacy Leakage from User Intention to Network  Traffic Mapping

  The exponential growth of mobile devices has raised concerns about sensitivedata leakage. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify suspiciouslocation-related HTTP transmission flows from the user's perspective, byanswering the question: Is the transmission user-intended? In contrast toprevious network-level detection schemes that mainly rely on a given set ofsuspicious hostnames, our approach can better adapt to the fast growth of appmarket and the constantly evolving leakage patterns. On the other hand,compared to existing system-level detection schemes built upon program taintanalysis, where all sensitive transmissions as treated as illegal, our approachbetter meets the user needs and is easier to deploy. In particular, ourproof-of-concept implementation (FlowIntent) captures sensitive transmissionsmissed by TaintDroid, the state-of-the-art dynamic taint analysis system onAndroid platforms. Evaluation using 1002 location sharing instances collectedfrom more than 20,000 apps shows that our approach achieves about 91% accuracyin detecting illegitimate location transmissions.

LeakSemantic: Identifying Abnormal Sensitive Network Transmissions in  Mobile Applications

  Mobile applications (apps) often transmit sensitive data through network withvarious intentions. Some transmissions are needed to fulfill the app'sfunctionalities. However, transmissions with malicious receivers may lead toprivacy leakage and tend to behave stealthily to evade detection. The problemis twofold: how does one unveil sensitive transmissions in mobile apps, andgiven a sensitive transmission, how does one determine if it is legitimate?  In this paper, we propose LeakSemantic, a framework that can automaticallylocate abnormal sensitive network transmissions from mobile apps. LeakSemanticconsists of a hybrid program analysis component and a machine learningcomponent. Our program analysis component combines static analysis and dynamicanalysis to precisely identify sensitive transmissions. Compared to existingtaint analysis approaches, LeakSemantic achieves better accuracy with fewerfalse positives and is able to collect runtime data such as network traffic foreach transmission. Based on features derived from the runtime data, machinelearning classifiers are built to further differentiate between the legal andillegal disclosures. Experiments show that LeakSemantic achieves 91% accuracyon 2279 sensitive connections from 1404 apps.

When to Reset Your Keys: Optimal Timing of Security Updates via Learning

  Cybersecurity is increasingly threatened by advanced and persistent attacks.As these attacks are often designed to disable a system (or a criticalresource, e.g., a user account) repeatedly, it is crucial for the defender tokeep updating its security measures to strike a balance between the risk ofbeing compromised and the cost of security updates. Moreover, these decisionsoften need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthynature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimaltiming policy under incomplete information has broad applications incybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application ofpatches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimaltiming are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-definedattack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case inpractice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimaltiming of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We considera variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback andunknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutivesecurity updates. The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associativebandit problem with dependent arms. We derive upper confidence bound basedlearning policies that achieve low regret compared with optimal periodicdefense strategies that can only be derived when attack time distributions areknown.

Edge Cloud Offloading Algorithms: Issues, Methods, and Perspectives

  Mobile devices supporting the "Internet of Things" (IoT), often have limitedcapabilities in computation, battery energy, and storage space, especially tosupport resource-intensive applications involving virtual reality (VR),augmented reality (AR), multimedia delivery and artificial intelligence (AI),which could require broad bandwidth, low response latency and largecomputational power. Edge cloud or edge computing is an emerging topic andtechnology that can tackle the deficiency of the currently centralized-onlycloud computing model and move the computation and storage resource closer tothe devices in support of the above-mentioned applications. To make thishappen, efficient coordination mechanisms and "offloading" algorithms areneeded to allow the mobile devices and the edge cloud to work togethersmoothly. In this survey paper, we investigate the key issues, methods, andvarious state-of-the-art efforts related to the offloading problem. We adopt anew characterizing model to study the whole process of offloading from mobiledevices to the edge cloud. Through comprehensive discussions, we aim to draw anoverall "big picture" on the existing efforts and research directions. Ourstudy also indicates that the offloading algorithms in edge cloud havedemonstrated profound potentials for future technology and applicationdevelopment.

Wireless Access to Ultimate Virtual Reality 360-Degree Video At Home

  Virtual reality 360-degree videos will become the first prosperous online VRapplication. VR 360 videos are data-hungry and latency-sensitive that poseunique challenges to the networking infrastructure. In this paper, we focus onthe ultimate VR 360 that satisfies human eye fidelity. The ultimate VR 360requires downlink 1.5 Gbps for viewing and uplink 6.6 Gbps for livebroadcasting, with round-trip time of less than 8.3 ms. On the other hand,wireless access to VR 360 services is preferred over wire-line transmissionbecause of the better user experience and the safety concern (e.g., trippinghazard). We explore in this paper whether the most advanced wirelesstechnologies from both cellular communications and WiFi communications supportthe ultimate VR 360. Specifically, we consider 5G in cellular communications,IEEE 802.11ac (operating in 5GHz) and IEEE 802.11ad (operating in 60GHz) inWiFi communications. According to their performance specified in theirstandards and/or empirical measurements, we have the following findings: (1)Only 5G has the potential to support both the the ultimate VR 360 viewing andlive broadcasting. However, it is difficult for 5G to support multiple users ofthe ultimate VR live broadcasting at home; (2) IEEE 802.11ac supports theultimate VR 360 viewing but fails to support the ultimate VR 360 livebroadcasting because it does not meet the data rate requirement of the ultimateVR 360 live broadcasting; (3) IEEE 802.11ad fails to support the ultimate VR360, because its current implementation incurs very high latency. Ourpreliminary results indicate that more advanced wireless technologies areneeded to fully support multiple ultimate VR 360 users at home.

Strong Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Unsupervised Machine Learning  Models

  Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have achievedstate-of-the-art performance on multiple learning tasks, from vision to naturallanguage modelling. With the growing adoption of ML and DL to many areas ofcomputer science, recent research has also started focusing on the securityproperties of these models. There has been a lot of work undertaken tounderstand if (deep) neural network architectures are resilient to black-boxadversarial attacks which craft perturbed input samples that fool theclassifier without knowing the architecture used. Recent work has also focusedon the transferability of adversarial attacks and found that adversarialattacks are generally easily transferable between models, datasets, andtechniques. However, such attacks and their analysis have not been covered fromthe perspective of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In this paper, weseek to bridge this gap through multiple contributions. We first provide astrong (iterative) black-box adversarial attack that can craft adversarialsamples which will be incorrectly clustered irrespective of the choice ofclustering algorithm. We choose 4 prominent clustering algorithms, and areal-world dataset to show the working of the proposed adversarial algorithm.Using these clustering algorithms we also carry out a simple study ofcross-technique adversarial attack transferability.
