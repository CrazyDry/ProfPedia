A Cryptographic Escrow for Treaty Declarations and Step-by-Step  Verification

  The verification of arms-control and disarmament agreements requires statesto provide declarations, including information on sensitive military sites andassets. There are important cases, however, where negotiations of theseagreements are impeded because states are reluctant to provide any such data,because of concerns about prematurely handing over militarily significantinformation. To address this challenge, we present a cryptographic escrow thatallows a state to make a complete declaration of sites and assets at the outsetand commit to its content, but only reveal the sensitive information thereinsequentially. Combined with an inspection regime, our escrow allows forstep-by-step verification of the correctness and completeness of the initialdeclaration so that the information release and inspections keep pace withparallel diplomatic and political processes. We apply this approach to thepossible denuclearization of North Korea. Such approach can be applied,however, to any agreement requiring the sharing of sensitive information.
