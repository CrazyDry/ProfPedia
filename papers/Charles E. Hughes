Practical free-space quantum key distribution over 10 km in daylight and
  at night

  We have demonstrated quantum key distribution (QKD) over a 10-km, 1-airmass
atmospheric range during daylight and at night. Secret random bit sequences of
the quality required for the cryptographic keys used to initialize secure
communications devices were transferred at practical rates with realistic
security. By identifying the physical parameters that determine the system's
secrecy efficiency, we infer that free-space QKD will be practical over much
longer ranges under these and other atmospheric and instrumental conditions.


Observation of the n(3He,t)p Reaction by Detection of Far-Ultraviolet
  Radiation

  We have detected Lyman alpha radiation as a product of the n(3He,t)p nuclear
reaction occurring in a cell of 3He gas. The predominant source of this
radiation appears to be decay of the 2p state of tritium produced by charge
transfer and excitation collisions with the background 3He gas. Under the
experimental conditions reported here we find yields of tens of Lyman alpha
photons for every neutron reaction. These results suggest a method of cold
neutron detection that is complementary to existing technologies that use
proportional counters. In particular, this approach may provide single neutron
sensitivity with wide dynamic range capability, and a class of neutron
detectors that are compact and operate at relatively low voltages.


Far-ultraviolet signatures of the 3He(n,tp) reaction in noble gas
  mixtures

  Previous work showed that the 3He(n,tp) reaction in a cell of 3He at
atmospheric pressure generated tens of far-ultraviolet photons per reacted
neutron. Here we report amplification of that signal by factors of 1000 and
more when noble gases are added to the cell. Calibrated filter-detector
measurements show that this large signal is due to noble-gas excimer emissions,
and that the nuclear reaction energy is converted to far-ultraviolet radiation
with efficiencies of up to 30%. The results have been placed on an absolute
scale through calibrations at the NIST SURF III synchrotron. They suggest
possibilities for high-efficiency neutron detectors as an alternative to
existing proportional counters.


Quantum key distribution at telecom wavelengths with noise-free
  detectors

  The length of a secure link over which a quantum key can be distributed
depends on the efficiency and dark-count rate of the detectors used at the
receiver. We report on the first demonstration of quantum key distribution
using transition-edge sensors with high efficiency and negligible dark-count
rates. Using two methods of synchronization, a bright optical pulse scheme and
an electrical signal scheme, we have successfully distributed key material at
1,550 nm over 50 km of optical fiber. We discuss how use of these detectors in
a quantum key distribution system can result in dramatic increases in range and
performance.


Long distance decoy state quantum key distribution in optical fiber

  The theoretical existence of photon-number-splitting attacks creates a
security loophole for most quantum key distribution (QKD) demonstrations that
use a highly attenuated laser source. Using ultra-low-noise, high-efficiency
transition-edge sensor photodetectors, we have implemented the first version of
a decoy-state protocol that incorporates finite statistics without the use of
Gaussian approximations in a one-way QKD system, enabling the creation of
secure keys immune to photon-number-splitting attacks and highly resistant to
Trojan horse attacks over 107 km of optical fiber.


Misalignment of Magnetic Fields and Outflows in Protostellar Cores

  We present results of 1.3 mm dust polarization observations toward 16 nearby,
low-mass protostars, mapped with ~2.5" resolution at CARMA. The results show
that magnetic fields in protostellar cores on scales of ~1000 AU are not
tightly aligned with outflows from the protostars. Rather, the data are
consistent with scenarios where outflows and magnetic fields are preferentially
misaligned (perpendicular), or where they are randomly aligned. If one assumes
that outflows emerge along the rotation axes of circumstellar disks, and that
the outflows have not disrupted the fields in the surrounding material, then
our results imply that the disks are not aligned with the fields in the cores
from which they formed.


High-resolution, vacuum-ultraviolet absorption spectrum of boron
  trifluoride

  In the course of investigations of thermal neutron detection based on
mixtures of $^{10}$BF$_3$ with other gases, knowledge was required of the
photoabsorption cross sections of $^{10}$BF$_3$ for wavelengths between 135 and
205 nm. Large discrepancies in the values reported in existing literature led
to the absolute measurements reported in this communication. The measurements
were made at the SURF III synchrotron radiation facility at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology. The measured absorption cross sections
vary from 10$^{-20}$ cm$^2$ at 135 nm to less than 10$^{-21}$ cm$^2$ in the
region from 165 to 205 nm. Three previously unreported absorption features with
resolvable structure were found in the regions 135 to 145 nm, 150 to 165 nm and
190 to 205 nm. Quantum mechanical calculations, using the TD-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ
variant of time-dependent density functional theory implemented in Gaussian 09,
suggest that the observed absorption features arise from symmetry-changing
adiabatic transitions.


Network-Centric Quantum Communications with Application to Critical
  Infrastructure Protection

  Network-centric quantum communications (NQC) - a new, scalable instantiation
of quantum cryptography providing key management with forward security for
lightweight encryption, authentication and digital signatures in optical
networks - is briefly described. Results from a multi-node experimental
test-bed utilizing integrated photonics quantum communications components,
known as QKarDs, include: quantum identification; verifiable quantum secret
sharing; multi-party authenticated key establishment, including group keying;
and single-fiber quantum-secured communications that can be applied as a
security retrofit/upgrade to existing optical fiber installations. A
demonstration that NQC meets the challenging simultaneous latency and security
requirements of electric grid control communications, which cannot be met
without compromises using conventional cryptography, is described.


Hand2Face: Automatic Synthesis and Recognition of Hand Over Face
  Occlusions

  A person's face discloses important information about their affective state.
Although there has been extensive research on recognition of facial
expressions, the performance of existing approaches is challenged by facial
occlusions. Facial occlusions are often treated as noise and discarded in
recognition of affective states. However, hand over face occlusions can provide
additional information for recognition of some affective states such as
curiosity, frustration and boredom. One of the reasons that this problem has
not gained attention is the lack of naturalistic occluded faces that contain
hand over face occlusions as well as other types of occlusions. Traditional
approaches for obtaining affective data are time demanding and expensive, which
limits researchers in affective computing to work on small datasets. This
limitation affects the generalizability of models and deprives researchers from
taking advantage of recent advances in deep learning that have shown great
success in many fields but require large volumes of data. In this paper, we
first introduce a novel framework for synthesizing naturalistic facial
occlusions from an initial dataset of non-occluded faces and separate images of
hands, reducing the costly process of data collection and annotation. We then
propose a model for facial occlusion type recognition to differentiate between
hand over face occlusions and other types of occlusions such as scarves, hair,
glasses and objects. Finally, we present a model to localize hand over face
occlusions and identify the occluded regions of the face.


The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale XII. The
  Discovery of Cepheids and a New Distance to NGC 2541

  We report the detection of Cepheids and a new distance to the spiral galaxy
NGC 2541, based on data obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on
board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A total of 25 exposures (divided into
13 epochs) are obtained using the F555W filter (transformed to Johnson V), and
nine exposures (divided into five epochs) using the F814W filter (transformed
to Cousins I). Photometric reduction of the data is performed using two
independent packages, DoPHOT and DAOPHOT II/ALLFRAME, which give very good
agreement in the measured magnitudes. A total of 34 bona fide Cepheids, with
periods ranging from 12 to over 60 days, are identified based on both sets of
photometry. By fitting V and I period-luminosity relations, apparent distance
moduli are derived assuming a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and mean
color excess of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E(B-V) = 0.10 mag respectively. Adopting
A(V)/E(V-I)=2.45, we obtain a true distance modulus to NGC 2541 of 30.47 +/-
0.11 (random) +/- 0.12 (systematic) mag (D = 12.4 +/- 0.6 (random) +/- 0.7
(systematic) Mpc), and a total (Galactic plus internal) mean color excess
E(B-V) = 0.08 +/- 0.05 (internal error) mag.


The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale XVII. The
  Cepheid Distance to NGC 4725

  The distance to NGC 4725 has been derived from Cepheid variables, as part of
the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale.
Thirteen F555W (V) and four F814W (I) epochs of cosmic-ray-split Wide Field and
Planetary Camera 2 observations were obtained. Twenty Cepheids were discovered,
with periods ranging from 12 to 49 days. Adopting a Large Magellanic Cloud
distance modulus and extinction of 18.50+/-0.10 mag and E(V-I)=0.13 mag,
respectively, a true reddening-corrected distance modulus (based on an analysis
employing the ALLFRAME software package) of 30.50 +/- 0.16 (random) +/- 0.17
(systematic) mag was determined for NGC 4725. The corresponding of distance of
12.6 +/- 1.0 (random) +/- 1.0 (systematic) Mpc is in excellent agreement with
that found with an independent analysis based upon the DoPHOT photometry
package. With a foreground reddening of only E(V-I)=0.02, the inferred
intrinsic reddening of this field in NGC 4725, E(V-I)=0.19, makes it one of the
most highly-reddened, encountered by the HST Key Project, to date.


High-spin structure in $^{40}$K

  High-spin states of $^{40}$K have been populated in the fusion-evaporation
reaction $^{12}$C($^{30}$Si,np)$^{40}$K and studied by means of $\gamma$-ray
spectroscopy techniques using one AGATA triple cluster detector, at INFN -
Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro. Several new states with excitation energy up
to 8 MeV and spin up to $10^-$ have been discovered. These new states are
discussed in terms of J=3 and T=0 neutron-proton hole pairs. Shell-model
calculations in a large model space have shown a good agreement with the
experimental data for most of the energy levels. The evolution of the structure
of this nucleus is here studied as a function of excitation energy and angular
momentum.


The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale. XXII. The
  Discovery of Cepheids in NGC 1326-A

  We report on the detection of Cepheids and the first distance measurement to
the spiral galaxy NGC 1326-A, a member of the Fornax cluster of galaxies. We
have employed data obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on board
the Hubble Space Telescope. Over a 49 day interval, a total of twelve V-band
(F555W) and eight I-band (F814W) epochs of observation were obtained. Two
photometric reduction packages, ALLFRAME and DoPHOT, have been employed to
obtain photometry measures from the three Wide Field CCDs. Variability analysis
yields a total of 17 Cepheids in common with both photometry datasets, with
periods ranging between 10 and 50 days. Of these 14 Cepheids with high-quality
lightcurves are used to fit the V and I period-luminosity relations and derive
apparent distance moduli, assuming a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus
(m-M) (LMC) = 18.50 +- 0.10 mag and color excess E(B-V) = 0.10 mag. Assuming
A(V)/E(V-I) = 2.45, the DoPHOT data yield a true distance modulus to NGC 1326-A
of (m-M)_0 = 31.36 +- 0.17 (random) +- 0.13 (systematic) mag, corresponding to
a distance of 18.7 \pm 1.5 (random) \pm 1.2 (systematic) Mpc. The derived
distance to NGC 1326-A is in good agreement with the distance derived
previously to NGC 1365, another spiral galaxy member of the Fornax cluster.
However the distances to both galaxies are significantly lower than to NGC
1425, a third Cepheid calibrator in the outer parts of the cluster.


The First Focused Hard X-ray Images of the Sun with NuSTAR

  We present results from the the first campaign of dedicated solar
observations undertaken by the \textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray}
({\em NuSTAR}) hard X-ray telescope. Designed as an astrophysics mission, {\em
NuSTAR} nonetheless has the capability of directly imaging the Sun at hard
X-ray energies ($>$3~keV) with an increase in sensitivity of at least two
magnitude compared to current non-focusing telescopes. In this paper we
describe the scientific areas where \textit{NuSTAR} will make major
improvements on existing solar measurements. We report on the techniques used
to observe the Sun with \textit{NuSTAR}, their limitations and complications,
and the procedures developed to optimize solar data quality derived from our
experience with the initial solar observations. These first observations are
briefly described, including the measurement of the Fe K-shell lines in a
decaying X-class flare, hard X-ray emission from high in the solar corona, and
full-disk hard X-ray images of the Sun.


Evidence of Significant Energy Input in the Late Phase of a Solar Flare
  from NuSTAR X-Ray Observations

  We present observations of the occulted active region AR12222 during the
third {\em NuSTAR} solar campaign on 2014 December 11, with concurrent {\em
SDO/}AIA and {\em FOXSI-2} sounding rocket observations. The active region
produced a medium size solar flare one day before the observations, at
$\sim18$UT on 2014 December 10, with the post-flare loops still visible at the
time of {\em NuSTAR} observations. The time evolution of the source emission in
the {\em SDO/}AIA $335\textrm{\AA}$ channel reveals the characteristics of an
extreme-ultraviolet late phase event, caused by the continuous formation of new
post-flare loops that arch higher and higher in the solar corona. The spectral
fitting of {\em NuSTAR} observations yields an isothermal source, with
temperature $3.8-4.6$ MK, emission measure $0.3-1.8 \times 10^{46}\textrm{
cm}^{-3}$, and density estimated at $2.5-6.0 \times 10^8 \textrm{ cm}^{-3}$.
The observed AIA fluxes are consistent with the derived {\em NuSTAR}
temperature range, favoring temperature values in the range $4.0-4.3$ MK. By
examining the post-flare loops' cooling times and energy content, we estimate
that at least 12 sets of post-flare loops were formed and subsequently cooled
between the onset of the flare and {\em NuSTAR} observations, with their total
thermal energy content an order of magnitude larger than the energy content at
flare peak time. This indicates that the standard approach of using only the
flare peak time to derive the total thermal energy content of a flare can lead
to a large underestimation of its value.


First NuSTAR Limits on Quiet Sun Hard X-Ray Transient Events

  We present the first results of a search for transient hard X-ray (HXR)
emission in the quiet solar corona with the \textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array} (\textit{NuSTAR}) satellite. While \textit{NuSTAR} was
designed as an astrophysics mission, it can observe the Sun above 2~keV with
unprecedented sensitivity due to its pioneering use of focusing optics.
\textit{NuSTAR} first observed quiet Sun regions on 2014 November 1, although
out-of-view active regions contributed a notable amount of background in the
form of single-bounce (unfocused) X-rays. We conducted a search for quiet Sun
transient brightenings on time scales of 100 s and set upper limits on emission
in two energy bands. We set 2.5--4~keV limits on brightenings with time scales
of 100 s, expressed as the temperature T and emission measure EM of a thermal
plasma. We also set 10--20~keV limits on brightenings with time scales of 30,
60, and 100 s, expressed as model-independent photon fluxes. The limits in both
bands are well below previous HXR microflare detections, though not low enough
to detect events of equivalent T and EM as quiet Sun brightenings seen in soft
X-ray observations. We expect future observations during solar minimum to
increase the \textit{NuSTAR} sensitivity by over two orders of magnitude due to
higher instrument livetime and reduced solar background.


Fermi LAT Search for Dark Matter in Gamma-ray Lines and the Inclusive
  Photon Spectrum

  Dark matter particle annihilation or decay can produce monochromatic
gamma-ray lines and contribute to the diffuse gamma-ray background. Flux upper
limits are presented for gamma-ray spectral lines from 7 to 200 GeV and for the
diffuse gamma-ray background from 4.8 GeV to 264 GeV obtained from two years of
Fermi Large Area Telescope data integrated over most of the sky. We give cross
section upper limits and decay lifetime lower limits for dark matter models
that produce gamma-ray lines or contribute to the diffuse spectrum, including
models proposed as explanations of the PAMELA and Fermi cosmic-ray data.


TADPOL: A 1.3 mm Survey of Dust Polarization in Star-forming Cores and
  Regions

  We present {\lambda}1.3 mm CARMA observations of dust polarization toward 30
star-forming cores and 8 star-forming regions from the TADPOL survey. We show
maps of all sources, and compare the ~2.5" resolution TADPOL maps with ~20"
resolution polarization maps from single-dish submillimeter telescopes. Here we
do not attempt to interpret the detailed B-field morphology of each object.
Rather, we use average B-field orientations to derive conclusions in a
statistical sense from the ensemble of sources, bearing in mind that these
average orientations can be quite uncertain. We discuss three main findings:
(1) A subset of the sources have consistent magnetic field (B-field)
orientations between large (~20") and small (~2.5") scales. Those same sources
also tend to have higher fractional polarizations than the sources with
inconsistent large-to-small-scale fields. We interpret this to mean that in at
least some cases B-fields play a role in regulating the infall of material all
the way down to the ~1000 AU scales of protostellar envelopes. (2) Outflows
appear to be randomly aligned with B-fields; although, in sources with low
polarization fractions there is a hint that outflows are preferentially
perpendicular to small-scale B-fields, which suggests that in these sources the
fields have been wrapped up by envelope rotation. (3) Finally, even at ~2.5"
resolution we see the so-called "polarization hole" effect, where the
fractional polarization drops significantly near the total intensity peak. All
data are publicly available in the electronic edition of this article.


Gamma-Ray and Parsec-Scale Jet Properties of a Complete Sample of
  Blazars From the MOJAVE Program

  We investigate the Fermi LAT gamma-ray and 15 GHz VLBA radio properties of a
joint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of AGNs obtained during the first 11
months of the Fermi mission (2008 Aug 4 - 2009 Jul 5). Our sample contains the
brightest 173 AGNs in these bands above declination -30 deg. during this
period, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray to
radio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. The latter
quantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range of
spectral energy distribution (SED) parameters in the bright blazar population.
The BL Lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasing
gamma-ray loudness with synchrotron SED peak frequency, suggesting a universal
SED shape for objects of this class. The synchrotron self-Compton model is
favored for the gamma-ray emission in these BL Lacs over external seed photon
models, since the latter predict a dependence of Compton dominance on Doppler
factor that would destroy any observed synchrotron SED peak - gamma-ray
loudness correlation. The high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) BL Lac objects are
distinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, and
none display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarization
levels. No equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQ) in our sample. Given the association of such properties with
relativistic beaming, we suggest that the HSP BL Lacs have generally lower
Doppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked BL Lacs or FSRQs in our
sample.


Detection of the Characteristic Pion-Decay Signature in Supernova
  Remnants

  Cosmic rays are particles (mostly protons) accelerated to relativistic
speeds. Despite wide agreement that supernova remnants (SNRs) are the sources
of galactic cosmic rays, unequivocal evidence for the acceleration of protons
in these objects is still lacking. When accelerated protons encounter
interstellar material, they produce neutral pions, which in turn decay into
gamma rays. This offers a compelling way to detect the acceleration sites of
protons. The identification of pion-decay gamma rays has been difficult because
high-energy electrons also produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung and inverse
Compton scattering. We detected the characteristic pion-decay feature in the
gamma-ray spectra of two SNRs, IC 443 and W44, with the Fermi Large Area
Telescope. This detection provides direct evidence that cosmic-ray protons are
accelerated in SNRs.


Constraints on the Galactic Population of TEV Pulsar Wind Nebulae Using
  Fermi Large Area Telescope Observations

  Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) have been established as the most populous class
of TeV gamma-ray emitters. Since launch, the Fermi Large Area Telescope
(LAT)identified five high-energy (100MeV <E< 100 GeV) gamma-ray sources as
PWNe, and detected a large number of PWNe candidates, all powered by young and
energetic pulsars. The wealth of multi-wavelength data available and the new
results provided by Fermi-LAT give us an opportunity to find new PWNe and to
explore the radiative processes taking place in known ones. The TeV gamma-ray
unidentifiedsources (UNIDs) are the best candidates for finding new PWNe. Using
45 months of Fermi-LAT data for energies above 10 GeV, an analysis was
performed near the position of 58TeV PWNe and UNIDs within 5deg of the Galactic
Plane to establish new constraints on PWNe properties and find new clues on the
nature of UNIDs. Of the 58 sources, 30 were detected, and this work provides
their gamma-rayfluxes for energies above 10 GeV. The spectral energy
distributions (SED) andupper limits, in the multi-wavelength context, also
provide new information on the source nature and can help distinguish between
emission scenarios, i.e. between classification as a pulsar candidate or as a
PWN candidate. Six new GeV PWNe candidates are described in detail and compared
with existing models. A population study of GeV PWNe candidates as a function
of the pulsar/PWN system characteristics is presented.


The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Two-Season ACTPol Spectra and
  Parameters

  We present the temperature and polarization angular power spectra measured by
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol). We analyze night-time
data collected during 2013-14 using two detector arrays at 149 GHz, from 548
deg$^2$ of sky on the celestial equator. We use these spectra, and the spectra
measured with the MBAC camera on ACT from 2008-10, in combination with Planck
and WMAP data to estimate cosmological parameters from the temperature,
polarization, and temperature-polarization cross-correlations. We find the new
ACTPol data to be consistent with the LCDM model. The ACTPol
temperature-polarization cross-spectrum now provides stronger constraints on
multiple parameters than the ACTPol temperature spectrum, including the baryon
density, the acoustic peak angular scale, and the derived Hubble constant.
Adding the new data to planck temperature data tightens the limits on damping
tail parameters, for example reducing the joint uncertainty on the number of
neutrino species and the primordial helium fraction by 20%.


Anisotropies in the diffuse gamma-ray background measured by the Fermi
  LAT

  The contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse gamma-ray background
could induce anisotropies in this emission on small angular scales. We analyze
the angular power spectrum of the diffuse emission measured by the Fermi LAT at
Galactic latitudes |b| > 30 deg in four energy bins spanning 1 to 50 GeV. At
multipoles \ell \ge 155, corresponding to angular scales \lesssim 2 deg,
angular power above the photon noise level is detected at >99.99% CL in the 1-2
GeV, 2-5 GeV, and 5-10 GeV energy bins, and at >99% CL at 10-50 GeV. Within
each energy bin the measured angular power takes approximately the same value
at all multipoles \ell \ge 155, suggesting that it originates from the
contribution of one or more unclustered source populations. The amplitude of
the angular power normalized to the mean intensity in each energy bin is
consistent with a constant value at all energies, C_P/<I>^2 = 9.05 +/- 0.84 x
10^{-6} sr, while the energy dependence of C_P is consistent with the
anisotropy arising from one or more source populations with power-law photon
spectra with spectral index \Gamma_s = 2.40 +/- 0.07. We discuss the
implications of the measured angular power for gamma-ray source populations
that may provide a contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray background.


Constraining Dark Matter Models from a Combined Analysis of Milky Way
  Satellites with the Fermi Large Area Telescope

  Satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are among the most promising targets for
dark matter searches in gamma rays. We present a search for dark matter
consisting of weakly interacting massive particles, applying a joint likelihood
analysis to 10 satellite galaxies with 24 months of data of the Fermi Large
Area Telescope. No dark matter signal is detected. Including the uncertainty in
the dark matter distribution, robust upper limits are placed on dark matter
annihilation cross sections. The 95% confidence level upper limits range from
about 1e-26 cm^3 s^-1 at 5 GeV to about 5e-23 cm^3 s^-1 at 1 TeV, depending on
the dark matter annihilation final state. For the first time, using gamma rays,
we are able to rule out models with the most generic cross section (~3e-26 cm^3
s^-1 for a purely s-wave cross section), without assuming additional boost
factors.


Inferred cosmic-ray spectrum from ${\it Fermi}$-LAT $γ$-ray
  observations of the Earth's limb

  Recent accurate measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) species by ATIC-2, CREAM, and
PAMELA reveal an unexpected hardening in the proton and He spectra above a few
hundred GeV, a gradual softening of the spectra just below a few hundred GeV,
and a harder spectrum of He compared to that of protons. These newly-discovered
features may offer a clue to the origin of high-energy CRs. We use the ${\it
Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope observations of the $\gamma$-ray emission from the
Earth's limb for an indirect measurement of the local spectrum of CR protons in
the energy range $\sim 90~$GeV-$6~$TeV (derived from a photon energy range
$15~$GeV-$1~$TeV). Our analysis shows that single power law and broken power
law spectra fit the data equally well and yield a proton spectrum with index
$2.68 \pm 0.04$ and $2.61 \pm 0.08$ above $\sim 200~$GeV, respectively.


Constraints on the Galactic Halo Dark Matter from Fermi-LAT Diffuse
  Measurements

  We have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with the
Fermi Large Area Telescope in the Milky Way Halo region searching for a signal
from dark matter annihilation or decay. In the absence of a robust dark matter
signal, constraints are presented. We consider both gamma rays produced
directly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse Compton
scattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. Conservative limits
are derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observed
diffuse gamma-ray emission. A second set of more stringent limits is derived
based on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using the
GALPROP code. Uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, the
distribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the Galaxy, the index of the
injection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of the
interstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,
while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derived
from fits to local cosmic-ray data. The resulting limits impact the range of
particle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early Universe
is possible, and challenge the interpretation of the PAMELA/Fermi-LAT cosmic
ray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.


Binary Millisecond Pulsar Discovery via Gamma-Ray Pulsations

  Millisecond pulsars, old neutron stars spun-up by accreting matter from a
companion star, can reach high rotation rates of hundreds of revolutions per
second. Until now, all such "recycled" rotation-powered pulsars have been
detected by their spin-modulated radio emission. In a computing-intensive blind
search of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (with partial
constraints from optical data), we detected a 2.5-millisecond pulsar, PSR
J1311-3430. This unambiguously explains a formerly unidentified gamma-ray
source that had been a decade-long enigma, confirming previous conjectures. The
pulsar is in a circular orbit with an orbital period of only 93 minutes, the
shortest of any spin-powered pulsar binary ever found.


Measurement of separate cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra with
  the Fermi Large Area Telescope

  We measured separate cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra with the Fermi
Large Area Telescope. Because the instrument does not have an onboard magnet,
we distinguish the two species by exploiting the Earth's shadow, which is
offset in opposite directions for opposite charges due to the Earth's magnetic
field. We estimate and subtract the cosmic-ray proton background using two
different methods that produce consistent results. We report the electron-only
spectrum, the positron-only spectrum, and the positron fraction between 20 GeV
and 200 GeV. We confirm that the fraction rises with energy in the 20-100 GeV
range. The three new spectral points between 100 and 200 GeV are consistent
with a fraction that is continuing to rise with energy.


Search for Dark Matter Satellites using the FERMI-LAT

  Numerical simulations based on the Lambda-CDM model of cosmology predict a
large number of as yet unobserved Galactic dark matter satellites. We report
the results of a Large Area Telescope (LAT) search for these satellites via the
gamma-ray emission expected from the annihilation of weakly interacting massive
particle (WIMP) dark matter. Some dark matter satellites are expected to have
hard gamma-ray spectra, finite angular extents, and a lack of counterparts at
other wavelengths. We sought to identify LAT sources with these
characteristics, focusing on gamma-ray spectra consistent with WIMP
annihilation through the $b \bar b$ channel. We found no viable dark matter
satellite candidates using one year of data, and we present a framework for
interpreting this result in the context of numerical simulations to constrain
the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section for a conventional 100 GeV
WIMP annihilating through the $b \bar b$ channel.


Dark Matter Constraints from Observations of 25 Milky Way Satellite
  Galaxies with the Fermi Large Area Telescope

  The dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are some of the most
dark-matter-dominated objects known. Due to their proximity, high dark matter
content, and lack of astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are
widely considered to be among the most promising targets for the indirect
detection of dark matter via gamma rays. Here we report on gamma-ray
observations of 25 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies based on 4
years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. None of the dwarf galaxies are
significantly detected in gamma rays, and we present gamma-ray flux upper
limits between 500 MeV and 500 GeV. We determine the dark matter content of 18
dwarf spheroidal galaxies from stellar kinematic data and combine LAT
observations of 15 dwarf galaxies to constrain the dark matter annihilation
cross section. We set some of the tightest constraints to date on the the
annihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 2 GeV and 10 TeV into
prototypical Standard Model channels. We find these results to be robust
against systematic uncertainties in the LAT instrument performance, diffuse
gamma-ray background modeling, and assumed dark matter density profile.


GeV Observations of Star-forming Galaxies with \textit{Fermi} LAT

  Recent detections of the starburst galaxies M82 and NGC 253 by gamma-ray
telescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are more
luminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. Building
upon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 GeV using 3 years of
data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the \textit{Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope} (\textit{Fermi}). Measured fluxes from significantly detected
sources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explore
the physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. We find further evidence for
quasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radio
continuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both to
quiescent galaxies of the Local Group and low-redshift starburst galaxies
(conservative $P$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical and
systematic uncertainties). The normalizations of these scaling relations
correspond to luminosity ratios of $\log(L_{0.1-100 \rm{GeV}}/L_{1.4 \rm{GHz}})
= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and
$\log(L_{0.1-100 \rm{GeV}}/L_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm
(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formation
rate of 1 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function.
Using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,
the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts
$0<z<2.5$ above 0.1 GeV is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ ph
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffuse
component measured with the LAT). We anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could be
detected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year
\textit{Fermi} mission.


Measurement of Target and Double-spin Asymmetries for the $\vec e\vec
  p\to eπ^+ (n)$ Reaction in the Nucleon Resonance Region at Low $Q^2$

  We report measurements of target- and double-spin asymmetries for the
exclusive channel $\vec e\vec p\to e\pi^+ (n)$ in the nucleon resonance region
at Jefferson Lab using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). These
asymmetries were extracted from data obtained using a longitudinally polarized
NH$_3$ target and a longitudinally polarized electron beam with energies 1.1,
1.3, 2.0, 2.3 and 3.0 GeV. The new results are consistent with previous CLAS
publications but are extended to a low $Q^2$ range from $0.0065$ to $0.35$
(GeV$/c$)$^2$. The $Q^2$ access was made possible by a custom-built Cherenkov
detector that allowed the detection of electrons for scattering angles as low
as $6^\circ$. These results are compared with the unitary isobar models JANR
and MAID, the partial-wave analysis prediction from SAID and the dynamic model
DMT. In many kinematic regions our results, in particular results on the target
asymmetry, help to constrain the polarization-dependent components of these
models.


The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Lensing of CMB Temperature and
  Polarization Derived from Cosmic Infrared Background Cross-Correlation

  We present a measurement of the gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) temperature and polarization fields obtained by
cross-correlating the reconstructed convergence signal from the first season of
ACTPol data at 146 GHz with Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) fluctuations
measured using the Planck satellite. Using an overlap area of 206 square
degrees, we detect gravitational lensing of the CMB polarization by large-scale
structure at a statistical significance of 4.5 sigma. Combining both CMB
temperature and polarization data gives a lensing detection at 9.1 sigma
significance. A B-mode polarization lensing signal is present with a
significance of 3.2 sigma. We also present the first measurement of CMB
lensing--CIB correlation at small scales corresponding to l > 2000. Null tests
and systematic checks show that our results are not significantly biased by
astrophysical or instrumental systematic effects, including Galactic dust.
Fitting our measurements to the best-fit lensing-CIB cross power spectrum
measured in Planck data, scaled by an amplitude A, gives A=1.02 +0.12/-0.18
(stat.) +/-0.06(syst.), consistent with the Planck results.


Target and Beam-Target Spin Asymmetries in Exclusive Pion
  Electroproduction for $Q^2>1$ GeV$^2$. I. $e p \rightarrow e π^+ n$

  Beam-target double-spin asymmetries and target single-spin asymmetries were
measured for the exclusive $\pi^+$ electroproduction reaction $\gamma^* p \to n
\pi^+$. The results were obtained from scattering of 6 GeV longitudinally
polarized electrons off longitudinally polarized protons using the CEBAF Large
Acceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic range covered is
$1.1<W<3$ GeV and $1<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$. Results were obtained for about 6000 bins
in $W$, $Q^2$, $\cos(\theta^*)$, and $\phi^*$. Except at forward angles, very
large target-spin asymmetries are observed over the entire $W$ region.
Reasonable agreement is found with phenomenological fits to previous data for
$W<1.6$ GeV, but very large differences are seen at higher values of $W$. A
GPD-based model is in poor agreement with the data. When combined with cross
section measurements, the present results provide powerful constraints on
nucleon resonance amplitudes at moderate and large values of $Q^2$, for
resonances with masses as high as 2.4 GeV.


Target and beam-target spin asymmetries in exclusive pion
  electroproduction for $Q^2>1$ GeV$^2$. II. $e p \rightarrow e π^0 p$

  Beam-target double-spin asymmetries and target single-spin asymmetries were
measured for the exclusive $\pi^0$ electroproduction reaction $\gamma^* p \to p
\pi^0$, expanding an analysis of the $\gamma^* p \to n \pi^+$ reaction from the
same experiment. The results were obtained from scattering of 6 GeV
longitudinally polarized electrons off longitudinally polarized protons using
the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic range
covered is $1.1<W<3$ GeV and $1<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$. Results were obtained for about
5700 bins in $W$, $Q^2$, \cthcm, and $\phi^*$. The beam-target asymmetries were
found to generally be greater than zero, with relatively modest \phicmsp
dependence. The target asymmetries exhibit very strong \phicmsp dependence,
with a change in sign occurring between results at low $W$ and high $W$, in
contrast to $\pi^+$ electroproduction. Reasonable agreement is found with
phenomenological fits to previous data for $W<1.6$ GeV, but significant
differences are seen at higher $W$. When combined with cross section
measurements, as well as $\pi^+$ observables, the present results will provide
powerful constraints on nucleon resonance amplitudes at moderate and large
values of $Q^2$, for resonances with masses as high as 2.4 GeV.


The Spectral Energy Distribution of Fermi bright blazars

  (Abridged) We have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-band
spectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the Fermi LAT Bright
AGN Sample (LBAS). By combining our accurately estimated Fermi gamma-ray
spectra with Swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard X-ray/gamma-ray
data, collected within three months of the LBAS data taking period, we were
able to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous Spectral Energy
Distributions (SED) for 48 LBAS blazars.The SED of these gamma-ray sources is
similar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, in
the usual Log $\nu $ - Log $\nu$ F$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-band
spectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energy
synchrotron radiation followed by inverse Compton emission of one or more
components. We have used these SEDs to characterize the peak intensity of both
the low and the high-energy components. The results have been used to derive
empirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from the
broad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to X-ray spectral
slopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. Our data show that the
synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^S$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and
10$^{14.5}$ Hz in broad-lined FSRQs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ Hz in
featureless BL Lacertae objects.We find that the gamma-ray spectral slope is
strongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the X-ray
spectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse Compton
scenarios. However, simple homogeneous, one-zone, Synchrotron Self Compton
(SSC) models cannot explain most of our SEDs, especially in the case of FSRQs
and low energy peaked (LBL) BL Lacs. (...)


First Measurement of the Polarization Observable E in the $\vec p(\vec
  γ,π^+)n$ Reaction up to 2.25 GeV

  First results from the longitudinally polarized frozen-spin target (FROST)
program are reported. The double-polarization observable E, for the reaction
$\vec \gamma \vec p \to \pi^+n$, has been measured using a circularly polarized
tagged-photon beam, with energies from 0.35 to 2.37 GeV. The final-state pions
were detected with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer in Hall B at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. These polarization data agree
fairly well with previous partial-wave analyses at low photon energies. Over
much of the covered energy range, however, significant deviations are observed,
particularly in the high-energy region where high-L multipoles contribute. The
data have been included in new multipole analyses resulting in updated nucleon
resonance parameters. We report updated fits from the Bonn-Gatchina, J\"ulich,
and SAID groups.


Gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS
  1830-211 observed by Fermi LAT

  The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
routinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and MeV-peaked flat
spectrum radio quasar PKS 1830-211 (z=2.507). Its apparent isotropic gamma-ray
luminosity (E>100 MeV) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peaking
on 2010 October 14/15 at 2.9 X 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightest
high-redshift Fermi blazars. No published model with a single lens can account
for all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. Based on radio
observations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 days
after a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. Two large gamma-ray
flares of PKS 1830-211 have been detected by the LAT in the considered period
and no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. This allows
us to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between the
two lensed images. Swift XRT observations from a dedicated Target of
Opportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significant
correlation of X-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. The spectral energy
distribution can be modeled with inverse Compton scattering of thermal photons
from the dusty torus. The implications of the LAT data in terms of variability,
the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-ray
flux ratios are discussed. Microlensing effects, absorption, size and location
of the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, an
energy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by the
lens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses for
understanding our results.


First Exclusive Measurement of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering off
  $^4$He: Toward the 3D Tomography of Nuclei

  We report on the first measurement of the beam-spin asymmetry in the
exclusive process of coherent deeply virtual Compton scattering off a nucleus.
The experiment used the 6 GeV electron beam from the CEBAF accelerator at
Jefferson Lab incident on a pressurized $^4$He gaseous target placed in front
of the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). The scattered electron was
detected by CLAS and the photon by a dedicated electromagnetic calorimeter at
forward angles. To ensure the exclusivity of the process, a specially designed
radial time projection chamber was used to detect the recoiling $^4$He nuclei.
We measured beam-spin asymmetries larger than those observed on the free proton
in the same kinematic domain. From these, we were able to extract, in a
model-independent way, the real and imaginary parts of the only $^4$He Compton
form factor, $\cal H_A$. This first measurement of coherent deeply virtual
Compton scattering on the $^4$He nucleus, with a fully exclusive final state
via nuclear recoil tagging, leads the way toward 3D imaging of the partonic
structure of nuclei.


Multi-wavelength observations of blazar AO 0235+164 in the 2008-2009
  flaring state

  The blazar AO 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objects
observed by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) since its launch in Summer 2008.
In addition to the continuous coverage by Fermi, contemporaneous observations
were carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 September
and 2009 February. In this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength data
collected during the campaign (including F-GAMMA, GASP- WEBT, Kanata, OVRO,
RXTE, SMARTS, Swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlation
between the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpret
the resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazar
emission models. We find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlated
with a series of near-IR/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in the
optical polarization degree. On the other hand, the X-ray light curve shows a
distinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match the
extrapolation of the optical/UV synchrotron spectrum. We tentatively interpret
this feature as the bulk Compton emission by cold electrons contained in the
jet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factor
of 19% at a distance of 100 Rg . We model the broadband spectra with a leptonic
model with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dusty
torus.


Target and Beam-Target Spin Asymmetries in Exclusive $π^+$ and $π^-$
  Electroproduction with 1.6 to 5.7 GeV Electrons

  Beam-target double spin asymmetries and target single-spin asymmetries in
exclusive $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ electroproduction were obtained from scattering
of 1.6 to 5.7 GeV longitudinally polarized electrons from longitudinally
polarized protons (for $\pi^+$) and deuterons (for $\pi^-$) using the CEBAF
Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic range
covered is $1.1<W<2.6$ GeV and $0.05<Q^2<5$ GeV$^2$, with good anglular
coverage in the forward hemisphere. The asymmetry results were divided into
approximately 40,000 kinematic bins for $\pi^+$ from free protons and 15,000
bins for $\pi^-$ production from bound nucleons in the deuteron. The present
results are found to be in reasonable agreement with fits to previous world
data for $W<1.7$ GeV and $Q^2<0.5$ GeV$^2$, with discrepancies increasing at
higher values of $Q^2$, especially for $W>1.5$ GeV. Very large target-spin
asymmetries are observed for $W>1.6$ GeV. When combined with cross section
measurements, the present results will provide powerful constraints on nucleon
resonance amplitudes at moderate and large values of $Q^2$, for resonances with
masses as high as 2.3 GeV.


Precise Determination of the Deuteron Spin Structure at Low to Moderate
  $Q^2$ with CLAS and Extraction of the Neutron Contribution

  We present the final results for the deuteron spin structure functions
obtained from the full data set collected with Jefferson Lab's CLAS in
2000-2001. Polarized electrons with energies of 1.6, 2.5, 4.2 and 5.8 GeV were
scattered from deuteron ($^{15}$ND$_3$) targets, dynamically polarized along
the beam direction, and detected with CLAS. From the measured double spin
asymmetry, the virtual photon absorption asymmetry $A_1^d$ and the polarized
structure function $g_1^d$ were extracted over a wide kinematic range (0.05
GeV$^2 < Q^2 <$ 5 GeV$^2$ and 0.9 GeV $< W <$ 3 GeV). We use an unfolding
procedure and a parametrization of the corresponding proton results to extract
from these data the polarized structure functions $A_1^n$ and $g_1^n$ of the
(bound) neutron, which are so far unknown in the resonance region, $W < 2$ GeV.
We compare our final results, including several moments of the deuteron and
neutron spin structure functions, with various theoretical models and
expectations as well as parametrizations of the world data. The unprecedented
precision and dense kinematic coverage of these data can aid in future
extractions of polarized parton distributions, tests of perturbative QCD
predictions for the quark polarization at large $x$, a better understanding of
quark-hadron duality, and more precise values for higher-twist matrix elements
in the framework of the Operator Product Expansion.


Deep Broadband Observations of the Distant Gamma-ray Blazar PKS 1424+240

  We present deep VERITAS observations of the blazar PKS 1424+240, along with
contemporaneous Fermi Large Area Telescope, Swift X-ray Telescope and Swift UV
Optical Telescope data between 2009 February 19 and 2013 June 8. This blazar
resides at a redshift of $z\ge0.6035$, displaying a significantly attenuated
gamma-ray flux above 100 GeV due to photon absorption via pair-production with
the extragalactic background light. We present more than 100 hours of VERITAS
observations from three years, a multiwavelength light curve and the
contemporaneous spectral energy distributions. The source shows a higher flux
of (2.1$\pm0.3$)$\times10^{-7}$ ph m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 120 GeV in 2009 and
2011 as compared to the flux measured in 2013, corresponding to
(1.02$\pm0.08$)$\times10^{-7}$ ph m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 120 GeV. The measured
differential very high energy (VHE; $E\ge100$ GeV) spectral indices are
$\Gamma=$3.8$\pm$0.3, 4.3$\pm$0.6 and 4.5$\pm$0.2 in 2009, 2011 and 2013,
respectively. No significant spectral change across the observation epochs is
detected. We find no evidence for variability at gamma-ray opacities of greater
than $\tau=2$, where it is postulated that any variability would be small and
occur on longer than year timescales if hadronic cosmic-ray interactions with
extragalactic photon fields provide a secondary VHE photon flux. The data
cannot rule out such variability due to low statistics.


A search for baryon- and lepton-number violating decays of $Λ$
  hyperons using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory

  We present a search for ten baryon-number violating decay modes of $\Lambda$
hyperons using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory. Nine of these decay
modes result in a single meson and single lepton in the final state ($\Lambda
\rightarrow m \ell$) and conserve either the sum or the difference of baryon
and lepton number ($B \pm L$). The tenth decay mode ($\Lambda \rightarrow
\bar{p}\pi^+$) represents a difference in baryon number of two units and no
difference in lepton number. We observe no significant signal and set upper
limits on the branching fractions of these reactions in the range
$(4-200)\times 10^{-7}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level.


Exclusive $η$ electroproduction at $W>2$ GeV with CLAS and
  transversity generalized parton distributions

  The cross section of the exclusive $\eta$ electroproduction reaction $ep\to
e^\prime p^\prime \eta$ was measured at Jefferson Lab with a 5.75-GeV electron
beam and the CLAS detector. Differential cross sections
$d^4\sigma/dtdQ^2dx_Bd\phi_\eta$ and structure functions $\sigma_U =
\sigma_T+\epsilon\sigma_L, \sigma_{TT}$ and $\sigma_{LT}$, as functions of $t$
were obtained over a wide range of $Q^2$ and $x_B$. The $\eta$ structure
functions are compared with those previously measured for $\pi^0$ at the same
kinematics. At low $t$, both $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ are described reasonably well
by generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in which chiral-odd transversity
GPDs are dominant. The $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ data, when taken together, can
facilitate the flavor decomposition of the transversity GPDs.


Semi-Inclusive $π_0$ target and beam-target asymmetries from 6 GeV
  electron scattering with CLAS

  We present precision measurements of the target and beam-target spin
asymmetries from neutral pion electroproduction in deep-inelastic scattering
(DIS) using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. We
scattered 6-GeV, longitudinally polarized electrons off longitudinally
polarized protons in a cryogenic $^{14}$NH$_3$ target, and extracted double and
single target spin asymmetries for $ep\rightarrow e^\prime\pi^0X$ in
multidimensional bins in four-momentum transfer ($1.0<Q^2<3.2$ GeV$^2$),
Bjorken-$x$ ($0.12<x<0.48$), hadron energy fraction ($0.4<z<0.7$), transverse
pion momentum ($0<P_T<1.0$ GeV), and azimuthal angle $\phi_h$ between the
lepton scattering and hadron production planes. We extracted asymmetries as a
function of both $x$ and $P_T$, which provide access to transverse-momentum
distributions of longitudinally polarized quarks. The double spin asymmetries
depend weakly on $P_T$. The $\sin 2\phi_h$ moments are zero within
uncertainties, which is consistent with the expected suppression of the Collins
fragmentation function. The observed $\sin\phi_h$ moments suggest that quark
gluon correlations are significant at large $x$.


Towards a resolution of the proton form factor problem: new electron and
  positron scattering data

  There is a significant discrepancy between the values of the proton electric
form factor, $G_E^p$, extracted using unpolarized and polarized electron
scattering. Calculations predict that small two-photon exchange (TPE)
contributions can significantly affect the extraction of $G_E^p$ from the
unpolarized electron-proton cross sections. We determined the TPE contribution
by measuring the ratio of positron-proton to electron-proton elastic scattering
cross sections using a simultaneous, tertiary electron-positron beam incident
on a liquid hydrogen target and detecting the scattered particles in the
Jefferson Lab CLAS detector. This novel technique allowed us to cover a wide
range in virtual photon polarization ($\varepsilon$) and momentum transfer
($Q^2$) simultaneously, as well as to cancel luminosity-related systematic
errors. The cross section ratio increases with decreasing $\varepsilon$ at $Q^2
= 1.45 \text{ GeV}^2$. This measurement is consistent with the size of the form
factor discrepancy at $Q^2\approx 1.75$ GeV$^2$ and with hadronic calculations
including nucleon and $\Delta$ intermediate states, which have been shown to
resolve the discrepancy up to $2-3$ GeV$^2$.


First measurement of the helicity asymmetry $E$ in $η$
  photoproduction on the proton

  Results are presented for the first measurement of the double-polarization
helicity asymmetry E for the $\eta$ photoproduction reaction $\gamma p
\rightarrow \eta p$. Data were obtained using the FROzen Spin Target (FROST)
with the CLAS spectrometer in Hall B at Jefferson Lab, covering a range of
center-of-mass energy W from threshold to 2.15 GeV and a large range in
center-of-mass polar angle. As an initial application of these data, the
results have been incorporated into the J\"ulich model to examine the case for
the existence of a narrow $N^*$ resonance between 1.66 and 1.70 GeV. The
addition of these data to the world database results in marked changes in the
predictions for the E observable using that model. Further comparison with
several theoretical approaches indicates these data will significantly enhance
our understanding of nucleon resonances.


Differential Cross Section Measurements for $γn\toπ^-p$ Above
  the First Nucleon Resonance Region

  The quasi-free $\gamma d\to\pi^{-}p(p)$ differential cross section has been
measured with CLAS at photon beam energies $E_\gamma$ from 0.445 GeV to 2.510
GeV (corresponding to $W$ from 1.311 GeV to 2.366 GeV) for pion center-of-mass
angles $\cos\theta_\pi^{c.m.}$ from -0.72 to 0.92. A correction for final state
interactions has been applied to this data to extract the $\gamma n\to\pi^-p$
differential cross sections. These cross sections are quoted in 8428
$(E_\gamma,\cos\theta_\pi^{c.m.})$ bins, a factor of nearly three increase in
the world statistics for this channel in this kinematic range. These new data
help to constrain coupled-channel analysis fits used to disentangle the
spectrum of $N^*$ resonances and extract their properties. Selected photon
decay amplitudes $N^* \to \gamma n$ at the resonance poles are determined for
the first time and are reported here.


Photon beam asymmetry $Σ$ in the reaction $\vecγ p \to p
  ω$ for $E_γ$ = 1.152 to 1.876 GeV

  Photon beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ measurements for $\omega$ photoproduction in
the reaction $\vec{\gamma} p \to \omega p$ are reported for photon energies
from 1.152 to 1.876 GeV. Data were taken using a linearly-polarized tagged
photon beam, a cryogenic hydrogen target, and the CLAS spectrometer in Hall B
at Jefferson Lab. The measurements obtained markedly increase the size of the
database for this observable, extend coverage to higher energies, and resolve
discrepancies in previously published data. Comparisons of these new results
with predictions from a chiral-quark-based model and from a dynamical
coupled-channels model indicate the importance of interferences between
$t$-channel meson exchange and $s$- and $u$-channel contributions, underscoring
sensitivity to the nucleon resonances included in those descriptions.
Comparisons with the Bonn-Gatchina partial-wave analysis indicate the $\Sigma$
data reported here help to fix the magnitudes of the interference terms between
the leading amplitudes in that calculation (Pomeron exchange and the resonant
portion of the $J^P=3/2^+$ partial wave), as well as the resonant portions of
the smaller partial waves with $J^P$= $1/2^-$, $3/2^-$, and $5/2^+$.
