An Incentive Compatible, Efficient Market for Air Traffic Flow  Management

  We present a market-based approach to the Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM)problem. The goods in our market are delays and buyers are airline companies;the latter pay money to the FAA to buy away the desired amount of delay on aper flight basis. We give a notion of equilibrium for this market and an LPwhose solution gives an equilibrium allocation of flights to landing slots aswell as equilibrium prices for the landing slots. Via a reduction to matching,we show that this equilibrium can be computed combinatorially in stronglypolynomial time. Moreover, there is a special set of equilibrium prices, whichcan be computed easily, that is identical to the VCG solution, and thereforethe market is incentive compatible in dominant strategy.

Learning Economic Parameters from Revealed Preferences

  A recent line of work, starting with Beigman and Vohra (2006) andZadimoghaddam and Roth (2012), has addressed the problem of {\em learning} autility function from revealed preference data. The goal here is to make use ofpast data describing the purchases of a utility maximizing agent when facedwith certain prices and budget constraints in order to produce a hypothesisfunction that can accurately forecast the {\em future} behavior of the agent.  In this work we advance this line of work by providing sample complexityguarantees and efficient algorithms for a number of important classes. Bydrawing a connection to recent advances in multi-class learning, we provide acomputationally efficient algorithm with tight sample complexity guarantees($\Theta(d/\epsilon)$ for the case of $d$ goods) for learning linear utilityfunctions under a linear price model. This solves an open question inZadimoghaddam and Roth (2012). Our technique yields numerous generalizationsincluding the ability to learn other well-studied classes of utility functions,to deal with a misspecified model, and with non-linear prices.

Settling Some Open Problems on 2-Player Symmetric Nash Equilibria

  Over the years, researchers have studied the complexity of several decisionversions of Nash equilibrium in (symmetric) two-player games (bimatrix games).To the best of our knowledge, the last remaining open problem of this sort isthe following; it was stated by Papadimitriou in 2007: find a non-symmetricNash equilibrium (NE) in a symmetric game. We show that this problem isNP-complete and the problem of counting the number of non-symmetric NE in asymmetric game is #P-complete.  In 2005, Kannan and Theobald defined the "rank of a bimatrix game"represented by matrices (A, B) to be rank(A+B) and asked whether a NE can becomputed in rank 1 games in polynomial time. Observe that the rank 0 case isprecisely the zero sum case, for which a polynomial time algorithm follows fromvon Neumann's reduction of such games to linear programming. In 2011, Adsul et.al. obtained an algorithm for rank 1 games; however, it does not solve the caseof symmetric rank 1 games. We resolve this problem.

Constant Rank Bimatrix Games are PPAD-hard

  The rank of a bimatrix game (A,B) is defined as rank(A+B). Computing a Nashequilibrium (NE) of a rank-$0$, i.e., zero-sum game is equivalent to linearprogramming (von Neumann'28, Dantzig'51). In 2005, Kannan and Theobald gave anFPTAS for constant rank games, and asked if there exists a polynomial timealgorithm to compute an exact NE. Adsul et al. (2011) answered this questionaffirmatively for rank-$1$ games, leaving rank-2 and beyond unresolved.  In this paper we show that NE computation in games with rank $\ge 3$, isPPAD-hard, settling a decade long open problem. Interestingly, this is thefirst instance that a problem with an FPTAS turns out to be PPAD-hard. Ourreduction bypasses graphical games and game gadgets, and provides a simplerproof of PPAD-hardness for NE computation in bimatrix games. In addition, weget:  * An equivalence between 2D-Linear-FIXP and PPAD, improving a result byEtessami and Yannakakis (2007) on equivalence between Linear-FIXP and PPAD.  * NE computation in a bimatrix game with convex set of Nash equilibria is ashard as solving a simple stochastic game.  * Computing a symmetric NE of a symmetric bimatrix game with rank $\ge 6$ isPPAD-hard.  * Computing a (1/poly(n))-approximate fixed-point of a (Linear-FIXP)piecewise-linear function is PPAD-hard.  The status of rank-$2$ games remains unresolved.

Leontief Exchange Markets Can Solve Multivariate Polynomial Equations,  Yielding FIXP and ETR Hardness

  We show FIXP-hardness of computing equilibria in Arrow-Debreu exchangemarkets under Leontief utility functions, and Arrow-Debreu markets under linearutility functions and Leontief production sets, thereby settling these openquestions (Vazirani and Yannakakis, 2009). As corollaries, we obtainFIXP-hardness for piecewise-linear concave (PLC) utilities and for Arrow-Debreumarkets under linear utility functions and polyhedral production sets. In allcases, as required under FIXP, the set of instances mapped onto will admitequilibria, i.e., will be "yes" instances. If all instances are underconsideration, then in all cases we prove that the problem of deciding if agiven instance admits an equilibrium is ETR-complete, where ETR is the classExistential Theory of Reals.  As a consequence of the results stated above, and the fact that membership inFIXP has been established for PLC utilities, the entire computationaldifficulty of Arrow-Debreu markets under PLC utility functions lies in theLeontief utility subcase. This is perhaps the most unexpected aspect of ourresult, since Leontief utilities are meant for the case that goods are perfectcomplements, whereas PLC utilities are very general, capturing not only thecases when goods are complements and substitutes, but also arbitrarycombinations of these and much more.  The main technical part of our result is the following reduction: Given a set'S' of simultaneous multivariate polynomial equations in which the variablesare constrained to be in a closed bounded region in the positive orthant, weconstruct a Leontief exchange market 'M' which has one good corresponding toeach variable in 'S'. We prove that the equilibria of 'M', when projected ontoprices of these latter goods, are in one-to-one correspondence with the set ofsolutions of the polynomials. This reduction is related to a classic result ofSonnenschein (1972-73).

Nash equilibria in Fisher market

  Much work has been done on the computation of market equilibria. However dueto strategic play by buyers, it is not clear whether these are actuallyobserved in the market. Motivated by the observation that a buyer may derive abetter payoff by feigning a different utility function and thereby manipulatingthe Fisher market equilibrium, we formulate the {\em Fisher market game} inwhich buyers strategize by posing different utility functions. We show thatexistence of a {\em conflict-free allocation} is a necessary condition for theNash equilibria (NE) and also sufficient for the symmetric NE in this game.There are many NE with very different payoffs, and the Fisher equilibriumpayoff is captured at a symmetric NE. We provide a complete polyhedralcharacterization of all the NE for the two-buyer market game. Surprisingly, allthe NE of this game turn out to be symmetric and the corresponding payoffsconstitute a piecewise linear concave curve. We also study the correlatedequilibria of this game and show that third-party mediation does not help toachieve a better payoff than NE payoffs.

Rank-1 Bi-matrix Games: A Homeomorphism and a Polynomial Time Algorithm

  Given a rank-1 bimatrix game (A,B), i.e., where rank(A+B)=1, we construct asuitable linear subspace of the rank-1 game space and show that this subspaceis homeomorphic to its Nash equilibrium correspondence. Using thishomeomorphism, we give the first polynomial time algorithm for computing anexact Nash equilibrium of a rank-1 bimatrix game. This settles an open questionposed in Kannan and Theobald (SODA 2007) and Theobald (2007). In addition, wegive a novel algorithm to enumerate all the Nash equilibria of a rank-1 gameand show that a similar technique may also be applied for finding a Nashequilibrium of any bimatrix game. This technique also proves the existence,oddness and the index theorem of Nash equilibria in a bimatrix game. Further,we extend the rank-1 homeomorphism result to a fixed rank game space, and givea fixed point formulation on $[0,1]^k$ for solving a rank-k game. Thehomeomorphism and the fixed point formulation are piece-wise linear andconsiderably simpler than the classical constructions.

Mutation, Sexual Reproduction and Survival in Dynamic Environments

  A new approach to understanding evolution [Val09], namely viewing it throughthe lens of computation, has already started yielding new insights, e.g.,natural selection under sexual reproduction can be interpreted as theMultiplicative Weight Update (MWU) Algorithm in coordination games played amonggenes [CLPV14]. Using this machinery, we study the role of mutation in changingenvironments in the presence of sexual reproduction. Following [WVA05], wemodel changing environments via a Markov chain, with the states representingenvironments, each with its own fitness matrix. In this setting, we show thatin the absence of mutation, the population goes extinct, but in the presence ofmutation, the population survives with positive probability. On the way toproving the above theorem, we need to establish some facts about dynamics ingames. We provide the first, to our knowledge, polynomial convergence bound fornoisy MWU in a coordination game. Finally, we also show that in staticenvironments, sexual evolution with mutation converges, for any level ofmutation.

A New Class of Combinatorial Markets with Covering Constraints:  Algorithms and Applications

  We introduce a new class of combinatorial markets in which agents havecovering constraints over resources required and are interested in delayminimization. Our market model is applicable to several settings includingscheduling, cloud computing, and communicating over a network. This model isquite different from the traditional models, to the extent that neither do theclassical equilibrium existence results seem to apply to it nor do any of theefficient algorithmic techniques developed to compute equilibria seem to applydirectly. We give a proof of existence of equilibrium and a polynomial timealgorithm for finding one, drawing heavily on techniques from LP duality andsubmodular minimization. We observe that in our market model, the set ofequilibrium prices could be a connected, non-convex set. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first natural example of the phenomenon where the set ofsolutions could have such complicated structure, yet there is a combinatorialpolynomial time algorithm to find one. Finally, we show that our model inheritsmany of the fairness properties of traditional equilibrium models.

Universal Growth in Production Economies

  We consider a simple variant of the von Neumann model of an expandingeconomy, in which multiple producers make goods according to their productionfunction. The players trade their goods at the market and then use the bundlesacquired for the production in the next round. We study a simple decentralizeddynamic---known as proportional response---in which players update their bidsproportionally to how useful the investments were in the past round.  We show this dynamic leads to growth of the economy in the long term(whenever growth is possible) but also creates unbounded inequality, i.e. veryrich and very poor players emerge. We analyze several other phenomena, such ashow the relation of a player with others influences its development and theGini index of the system.  One of the key technical findings is that the players learn a global featureof the network (the optimal cycle) in a decentralized way, while interactinglocally with their direct neighbors. We obtain this by studying the volume inthe resulting dynamical system and showing that the volume of each cycleexpands or contracts by a constant factor in each round.

Maximizing Profit with Convex Costs in the Random-order Model

  Suppose a set of requests arrives online: each request gives some value $v_i$if accepted, but requires using some amount of each of $d$ resources. Our costis a convex function of the vector of total utilization of these $d$ resources.Which requests should be accept to maximize our profit, i.e., the sum of valuesof the accepted demands, minus the convex cost?  We consider this problem in the random-order a.k.a. secretary model, and showan $O(d)$-competitive algorithm for the case where the convex cost function isalso supermodular. If the set of accepted demands must also be independent in agiven matroid, we give an $O(d^3 \alpha)$-competitive algorithm for thesupermodular case, and an improved $O(d^2\alpha)$ if the convex cost functionis also separable. Here $\alpha$ is the competitive ratio of the best algorithmfor the submodular secretary problem. These extend and improve previous resultsknown for this problem. Our techniques are simple but use powerful ideas fromconvex duality, which give clean interpretations of existing work, and allow usto give the extensions and improvements.

Performance Metric Elicitation from Pairwise Classifier Comparisons

  Given a binary prediction problem, which performance metric should theclassifier optimize? We address this question by formalizing the problem ofMetric Elicitation. The goal of metric elicitation is to discover theperformance metric of a practitioner, which reflects her innate rewards (costs)for correct (incorrect) classification. In particular, we focus on elicitingbinary classification performance metrics from pairwise feedback, where apractitioner is queried to provide relative preference between two classifiers.By exploiting key geometric properties of the space of confusion matrices, weobtain provably query efficient algorithms for eliciting linear andlinear-fractional performance metrics. We further show that our method isrobust to feedback and finite sample noise.

Fast Algorithms for Rank-1 Bimatrix Games

  The rank of a bimatrix game is the matrix rank of the sum of the two payoffmatrices. For a game of rank k, the set of its Nash equilibria is theintersection of a generically one-dimensional set of equilibria ofparameterized games of rank k-1 with a hyperplane. We comprehensively analyzegames of rank one. They are economonically more interesting than zero-sum games(which have rank zero), but are nearly as easy to solve. One equilibrium of arank-1 game can be found in polynomial time. All equilibria of a rank-1 gamecan be found by path-following, which finds only one equilibrium of a bimatrixgame. The number of equilibria of a rank-1 game may be exponential. We alsopresent a new rank-preserving homeomorphism between bimatrix games and theirequilibrium correspondence.

Bilinear Games: Polynomial Time Algorithms for Rank Based Subclasses

  Motivated by the sequence form formulation of Koller et al. (GEB'96), thispaper defines {\em bilinear games}, and proposes efficient algorithms for itsrank based subclasses. Bilinear games are two-player non-cooperativesingle-shot games with compact polytopal strategy sets and two payoff matrices(A,B) such that when (x,y) is the played strategy profile, the payoffs of theplayers are xAy and xBy respectively. We show that bilinear games are verygeneral and capture many interesting classes of games like bimatrix games, twoplayer Bayesian games, polymatrix games, two-player extensive form games withperfect recall etc. as special cases, and hence are hard to solve in general.  Existence of a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium for (symmetric) bilinear gamesfollow directly from the known results. For a given bilinear game, we defineits {\em Best Response Polytopes} (BRPs) and characterize the set of Nashequilibria as {\em fully-labeled} pairs in the BRPs. We consider a rank basedhierarchy of bilinear games, where rank of a game (A,B) is defined asrank(A+B). In this paper, we give polynomial time algorithms to compute Nashequilibrium for special classes of bilinear games:  (i) Rank-1 games (i.e., rank(A+B)=1). (ii) FPTAS for constant rank games(i.e., rank(A+B) is constant). (iii) When rank(A) or rank(B) is constant. Thisimproves the results by Lipton et al. (EC'03) and Kannan et al. (ET'09), forbimatrix games with low rank matrices.

Natural Selection as an Inhibitor of Genetic Diversity: Multiplicative  Weights Updates Algorithm and a Conjecture of Haploid Genetics

  In a recent series of papers a surprisingly strong connection was discoveredbetween standard models of evolution in mathematical biology and MultiplicativeWeights Updates Algorithm, a ubiquitous model of online learning andoptimization. These papers establish that mathematical models of biologicalevolution are tantamount to applying discrete Multiplicative Weights UpdatesAlgorithm, a close variant of MWUA, on coordination games. This connectionallows for introducing insights from the study of game theoretic dynamics intothe field of mathematical biology. Using these results as a stepping stone, weshow that mathematical models of haploid evolution imply the extinction ofgenetic diversity in the long term limit, a widely believed conjecture ingenetics. In game theoretic terms we show that in the case of coordinationgames, under minimal genericity assumptions, discrete MWUA converges to pureNash equilibria for all but a zero measure of initial conditions. This resultholds despite the fact that mixed Nash equilibria can be exponentially (or evenuncountably) many, completely dominating in number the set of pure Nashequilibria. Thus, in haploid organisms the long term preservation of geneticdiversity needs to be safeguarded by other evolutionary mechanisms such asmutations and speciation.

The Complexity of Genetic Diversity

  A key question in biological systems is whether genetic diversity persists inthe long run under evolutionary competition or whether a single dominantgenotype emerges. Classic work by Kalmus in 1945 has established that even insimple diploid species (species with two chromosomes) diversity can beguaranteed as long as the heterozygote individuals enjoy a selective advantage.Despite the classic nature of the problem, as we move towards increasinglypolymorphic traits (e.g. human blood types) predicting diversity andunderstanding its implications is still not fully understood. Our keycontribution is to establish complexity theoretic hardness results implyingthat even in the textbook case of single locus diploid models predictingwhether diversity survives or not given its fitness landscape isalgorithmically intractable. We complement our results by establishing thatunder randomly chosen fitness landscapes diversity survives with significantprobability. Our results are structurally robust along several dimensions(e.g., choice of parameter distribution, different definitions ofstability/persistence, restriction to typical subclasses of fitnesslandscapes). Technically, our results exploit connections between game theory,nonlinear dynamical systems, complexity theory and biology and establishhardness results for predicting the evolution of a deterministic variant of thewell known multiplicative weights update algorithm in symmetric coordinationgames which could be of independent interest.

To Give or Not to Give: Fair Division for Single Minded Valuations

  Single minded agents have strict preferences, in which a bundle is acceptableonly if it meets a certain demand. Such preferences arise naturally inscenarios such as allocating computational resources among users, where thegoal is to fairly serve as many requests as possible. In this paper we studythe fair division problem for such agents, which is harder to handle due todiscontinuity and complementarities of the preferences.  Our solution concept---the competitive allocation from equal incomes(CAEI)---is inspired from market equilibria and implements fair outcomesthrough a pricing mechanism. We study the existence and computation of CAEI formultiple divisible goods, cake cutting, and multiple discrete goods. For thefirst two scenarios we show that existence of CAEI solutions is guaranteed,while for the third we give a succinct characterization of instances that admitthis solution; then we give an efficient algorithm to find one in all threecases. Maximizing social welfare turns out to be NP-hard in general, however weobtain efficient algorithms for (i) divisible and discrete goods when thenumber of different \emph{types} of players is a constant, (ii) cake cuttingwith contiguous demands, for which we establish an interesting connection withinterval scheduling, and (iii) cake cutting with a constant number of playerswith arbitrary demands.  Our solution is useful more generally, when the players have a target set ofdesired goods, and very small positive values for any bundle not containingtheir target set.

CLS: New Problems and Completeness

  The complexity class CLS was introduced by Daskalakis and Papadimitriou withthe goal of capturing the complexity of some well-known problems inPPAD$~\cap~$PLS that have resisted, in some cases for decades, attempts to putthem in polynomial time. No complete problem was known for CLS, and in previouswork, the problems ContractionMap, i.e., the problem of finding an approximatefixpoint of a contraction map, and PLCP, i.e., the problem of solving aP-matrix Linear Complementarity Problem, were identified as prime candidates.  First, we present a new CLS-complete problem MetaMetricContractionMap, whichis closely related to the ContractionMap. Second, we introduceEndOfPotentialLine, which captures aspects of PPAD and PLS directly via amonotonic directed path, and show that EndOfPotentialLine is in CLS via atwo-way reduction to EndOfMeteredLine. The latter was defined to keep track ofhow far a vertex is on the PPAD path via a restricted potential function.Third, we reduce PLCP to EndOfPotentialLine, thus making EndOfPotentialLine andEndOfMeteredLine at least as likely to be hard for CLS as PLCP. This lastresult leverages the monotonic structure of Lemke paths for PLCP problems,making EndOfPotentialLine a likely candidate to capture the exact complexity ofPLCP; we note that the structure of Lemke-Howson paths for finding a Nashequilibrium in a two-player game very directly motivated the definition of thecomplexity class PPAD, which eventually ended up capturing this problem'scomplexity exactly.

Social welfare and profit maximization from revealed preferences

  Consider the seller's problem of finding optimal prices for her $n$(divisible) goods when faced with a set of $m$ consumers, given that she canonly observe their purchased bundles at posted prices, i.e., revealedpreferences. We study both social welfare and profit maximization with revealedpreferences. Although social welfare maximization is a seemingly non-convexoptimization problem in prices, we show that (i) it can be reduced to a dualconvex optimization problem in prices, and (ii) the revealed preferences can beinterpreted as supergradients of the concave conjugate of valuation, with whichsubgradients of the dual function can be computed. We thereby obtain a simplesubgradient-based algorithm for strongly concave valuations and convex cost,with query complexity $O(m^2/\epsilon^2)$, where $\epsilon$ is the additivedifference between the social welfare induced by our algorithm and the optimumsocial welfare. We also study social welfare maximization under the onlinesetting, specifically the random permutation model, where consumers arriveone-by-one in a random order. For the case where consumer valuations can bearbitrary continuous functions, we propose a price posting mechanism thatachieves an expected social welfare up to an additive factor of $O(\sqrt{mn})$from the maximum social welfare. Finally, for profit maximization (which may benon-convex in simple cases), we give nearly matching upper and lower bounds onthe query complexity for separable valuations and cost (i.e., each good can betreated independently).

Sum-of-Squares meets Nash: Optimal Lower Bounds for Finding any  Equilibrium

  Several works have shown unconditional hardness (via integrality gaps) ofcomputing equilibria using strong hierarchies of convex relaxations. Suchresults however only apply to the problem of computing equilibria that optimizea certain objective function and not to the (arguably more fundamental) task offinding \emph{any} equilibrium.  We present an algorithmic model based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchythat allows escaping this inherent limitation of integrality gaps. In thismodel, algorithms access the input game only through a relaxed solution to thenatural SoS relaxation for computing equilibria. They can then adaptivelyconstruct a list of candidate solutions and invoke a verification oracle tocheck if any candidate on the list is a solution. This model captures mostwell-studied approximation algorithms such as those for Max-Cut, Sparsest Cut,and Unique-Games.  The state-of-the-art algorithms for computing exact and approximateequilibria in two-player, n-strategy games are captured in this model andrequire that at least one of i) size (~ running time) of the SoS relaxation orii) the size of the list of candidates, be at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$ and$n^{\Omega(\log{(n)})}$ respectively. Our main result shows a lower bound thatmatches these upper bound up to constant factors in the exponent.  This can be interpreted as an unconditional confirmation, in our restrictedalgorithmic framework, of Rubinstein's recent conditional hardness \cite{Rub}for computing approximate equilibria.  Our proof strategy involves constructing a family of games that all share acommon sum-of-squares solution but every (approximate) equilibrium of one gameis far from every (approximate) equilibrium of any other game in the family.

Resource Allocation Game on Social Networks: Best Response Dynamics and  Convergence

  The decisions that human beings make to allocate time has significant bearingon economic output and to the sustenance of social networks. The timeallocation problem motivates our formal analysis of the resource allocationgame, where agents on a social network, who have asymmetric, privateinteraction preferences, make decisions on how to allocate time, a boundedendowment, over their neighbors. Unlike the well-known opinion formation gameon a social network, our game appears not to be a potential game, and theBest-Response dynamics is non-differentiable making the analysis ofBest-Response dynamics non-trivial.  In our game, we consider two types of player behavior, namely optimistic orpessimistic, based on how they use their time endowment over their neighbors.To analyze Best-Response dynamics, we circumvent the problem of the game notbeing a potential game, through the lens of a novel two-level potentialfunction approach. We show that the Best-Response dynamics converges point-wiseto a Nash Equilibrium when players are all: optimistic; pessimistic; a mix ofboth types. Finally, we show that the Nash Equilibrium set is non-convex butconnected, and Price of Anarchy is unbounded while Price of Stability is one.Extensive simulations over a stylized grid reveals that the distribution ofquality of the convergence points is unimodal-we conjecture that presence ofunimodality is tied to the connectedness of Nash Equilibrium.

Nash Social Welfare Approximation for Strategic Agents

  The fair division of resources is an important age-old problem that has ledto a rich body of literature. At the center of this literature lies thequestion of whether there exist fair mechanisms despite strategic behavior ofthe agents. A fundamental objective function used for measuring fair outcomesis the Nash social welfare, defined as the geometric mean of the agentutilities. This objective function is maximized by widely known solutionconcepts such as Nash bargaining and the competitive equilibrium with equalincomes. In this work we focus on the question of (approximately) implementingthe Nash social welfare. The starting point of our analysis is the Fishermarket, a fundamental model of an economy, whose benchmark is precisely the(weighted) Nash social welfare. We begin by studying two extreme classes ofvaluations functions, namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, andfind that for perfect substitutes, the Fisher market mechanism has a constantapproximation: at most 2 and at least e1e. However, for perfect complements,the Fisher market does not work well, its bound degrading linearly with thenumber of players.  Strikingly, the Trading Post mechanism---an indirect market mechanism alsoknown as the Shapley-Shubik game---has significantly better performance thanthe Fisher market on its own benchmark. Not only does Trading Post achieve anapproximation of 2 for perfect substitutes, but this bound holds for allconcave utilities and becomes arbitrarily close to optimal for Leontiefutilities (perfect complements), where it reaches $(1+\epsilon)$ for every$\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, all the Nash equilibria of the Trading Post mechanismare pure for all concave utilities and satisfy an important notion of fairnessknown as proportionality.

End of Potential Line

  We introduce the problem EndOfPotentialLine and the corresponding complexityclass EOPL of all problems that can be reduced to it in polynomial time. Thisclass captures problems that admit a single combinatorial proof of their jointmembership in the complexity classes PPAD of fixpoint problems and PLS of localsearch problems. EOPL is a combinatorially-defined alternative to the class CLS(for Continuous Local Search), which was introduced in with the goal ofcapturing the complexity of some well-known problems in PPAD $\cap$ PLS thathave resisted, in some cases for decades, attempts to put them in polynomialtime. Two of these are Contraction, the problem of finding a fixpoint of acontraction map, and P-LCP, the problem of solving a P-matrix LinearComplementarity Problem.  We show that EndOfPotentialLine is in CLS via a two-way reduction toEndOfMeteredLine. The latter was defined in to show query and cryptographiclower bounds for CLS. Our two main results are to show that both PL-Contraction(Piecewise-Linear Contraction) and P-LCP are in EOPL. Our reductions imply thatthe promise versions of PL-Contraction and P-LCP are in the promise classUniqueEOPL, which corresponds to the case of a single potential line. This alsoshows that simple-stochastic, discounted, mean-payoff, and parity games are inEOPL.  Using the insights from our reduction for PL-Contraction, we obtain the firstpolynomial-time algorithms for finding fixed points of contraction maps infixed dimension for any $\ell_p$ norm, where previously such algorithms wereonly known for the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ norms. Our reduction from P-LCPto EndOfPotentialLine allows a technique of Aldous to be applied, which in turngives the fastest-known randomized algorithm for the P-LCP.

Smoothed Efficient Algorithms and Reductions for Network Coordination  Games

  Worst-case hardness results for most equilibrium computation problems haveraised the need for beyond-worst-case analysis. To this end, we study thesmoothed complexity of finding pure Nash equilibria in Network CoordinationGames, a PLS-complete problem in the worst case. This is a potential game wherethe sequential-better-response algorithm is known to converge to a pure NE,albeit in exponential time. First, we prove polynomial (resp. quasi-polynomial)smoothed complexity when the underlying game graph is a complete (resp.arbitrary) graph, and every player has constantly many strategies. We note thatthe complete graph case is reminiscent of perturbing all parameters, a commonassumption in most known smoothed analysis results.  Second, we define a notion of smoothness-preserving reduction among searchproblems, and obtain reductions from $2$-strategy network coordination games tolocal-max-cut, and from $k$-strategy games (with arbitrary $k$) tolocal-max-cut up to two flips. The former together with the recent result of[BCC18] gives an alternate $O(n^8)$-time smoothed algorithm for the$2$-strategy case. This notion of reduction allows for the extension ofsmoothed efficient algorithms from one problem to another.  For the first set of results, we develop techniques to bound the probabilitythat an (adversarial) better-response sequence makes slow improvements on thepotential. Our approach combines and generalizes the local-max-cut approachesof [ER14,ABPW17] to handle the multi-strategy case: it requires a carefuldefinition of the matrix which captures the increase in potential, a tighterunion bound on adversarial sequences, and balancing it with good enough rankbounds. We believe that the approach and notions developed herein could be ofinterest in addressing the smoothed complexity of other potential and/orcongestion games.

Unique End of Potential Line

  This paper studies the complexity of problems in PPAD $\cap$ PLS that haveunique solutions. Three well-known examples of such problems are the problem offinding a fixpoint of a contraction map, finding the unique sink of a UniqueSink Orientation (USO), and solving the P-matrix Linear Complementarity Problem(P-LCP). Each of these are promise-problems, and when the promise holds, theyalways possess unique solutions.  We define the complexity class UEOPL to capture problems of this type. Wefirst define a class that we call EOPL, which consists of all problems that canbe reduced to End-of-Potential-Line. This problem merges the canonicalPPAD-complete problem End-of-Line, with the canonical PLS-complete problemSink-of-Dag, and so EOPL captures problems that can be solved by aline-following algorithm that also simultaneously decreases a potentialfunction.  Promise-UEOPL is a promise-subclass of EOPL in which the line in theEnd-of-Potential-Line instance is guaranteed to be unique via a promise. Weturn this into a non-promise class UEOPL, by adding an extra solution type toEOPL that captures any pair of points that are provably on two different lines.  We show that UEOPL $\subseteq$ EOPL $\subseteq$ CLS, and that all of ourmotivating problems are contained in UEOPL: specifically USO, P-LCP, andfinding a fixpoint of a Piecewise-Linear Contraction under an $\ell_p$-norm alllie in UEOPL. Our results also imply that parity games, mean-payoff games,discounted games, and simple-stochastic games lie in UEOPL.  All of our containment results are proved via a reduction to a problem thatwe call One-Permutation Discrete Contraction (OPDC). This problem is motivatedby a discretized version of contraction, but it is also closely related to theUSO problem. We show that OPDC lies in UEOPL, and we are also able to show thatOPDC is UEOPL-complete.
