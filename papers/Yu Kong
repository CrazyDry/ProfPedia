  We have studied anomalous diffusion of a particle in a random medium in whichthe passage of the particle may modify the state of the visited sites. Thesimplicity of the dynamics allows analytic solution. Interesting propagationand organization behaviors will be reported.

Discovery potential of Kaluza-Klein gluons at hadron colliders: A  Snowmass whitepaper

  We investigate the discovery potential of Kaluza-Klein gluons as a dijetresonance at hadron colliders with different center-of-mass energies, from 14TeV to 33 TeV to 100 TeV. We also present the current bounds from dijetsearches at UA2, Tevatron, and LHC.

Mean Field Theory for Lossy Nonlinear Composites

  The mean-field theory for lossy nonlinear composites, described by complexand field-dependent dielectric functions, is presented. By using the spectralrepresentation of linear composites with identical microstructure, we developself-consistent equations for the effective response. We examine two types ofmicrostructure, namely, the Maxwell-Garnett approximation and the effectivemedium approximation to illustrate the theory.

Dielectric behaviors of corrugated membranes

  We have employed our recently developed Green's function formalism to studythe dielectric behavior of a model membrane, formed by two periodic interfacesseparating two media of different dielectric constants. The Maxwell's equationsare converted into a surface integral equation; thus it greatly simplifies thesolutions and yields accurate results for membranes of arbitrary shape. Theintegral equation is solved and dielectric dispersion spectrum is obtained fora model corrugated membrane. We report a giant dielectric dispersion as theamplitude of corrugation becomes large.

Hausdorff dimension, Mean quadratic variation of infinite self-similar  measures

  Under weaker condition than that of Riedi & Mandelbrot, the Hausdorff (andHausdorff-Besicovitch) dimension of infinite self-similar set K which is theinvariant compact set of infinite contractive similarities {S_j(x)} satisfyingopen set condition is obtained. It is proved (under some additional hypotheses)that the mean quadratic variation of infinite self-similar measure is ofasymptotic property.

Sensor Deployment for Air Pollution Monitoring Using Public  Transportation System

  Air pollution monitoring is a very popular research topic and many monitoringsystems have been developed. In this paper, we formulate the Bus SensorDeployment Problem (BSDP) to select the bus routes on which sensors aredeployed, and we use Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) to solve BSDP. CRO isa recently proposed metaheuristic designed to solve a wide range ofoptimization problems. Using the real world data, namely Hong Kong Island busroute data, we perform a series of simulations and the results show that CRO iscapable of solving this optimization problem efficiently.

Enhancement of Optical Nonlinearity Through Anisotropic Microstructures

  We investigate the polarization dependence of optical nonlinearityenhancement for a uniaxial anisotropic composite of metal nanocrystals in adielectric host. Three cases are distinguished depending on whether thepolarization is parallel, perpendicular or unpolarized with respect to the axisof anisotropy. For the parallel polarization, the results show that the 3Dresults are qualitatively similar to the 2D case reported recently. For theperpendicular polarization, the results are markedly different from theparallel counterpart: In contrast to the absorption, the enhancement factoractually increases with the anisotropy. Thus the separation of the absorptionand enhancement peaks becomes even more pronounced than the parallelpolarization case. These results indicate a strong polarization dependence ofthe nonlinear optical response.

Human Action Recognition and Prediction: A Survey

  Derived from rapid advances in computer vision and machine learning, videoanalysis tasks have been moving from inferring the present state to predictingthe future state. Vision-based action recognition and prediction from videosare such tasks, where action recognition is to infer human actions (presentstate) based upon complete action executions, and action prediction to predicthuman actions (future state) based upon incomplete action executions. These twotasks have become particularly prevalent topics recently because of theirexplosively emerging real-world applications, such as visual surveillance,autonomous driving vehicle, entertainment, and video retrieval, etc. Manyattempts have been devoted in the last a few decades in order to build a robustand effective framework for action recognition and prediction. In this paper,we survey the complete state-of-the-art techniques in the action recognitionand prediction. Existing models, popular algorithms, technical difficulties,popular action databases, evaluation protocols, and promising future directionsare also provided with systematic discussions.

Partial Functional Linear Quantile Regression for Neuroimaging Data  Analysis

  We propose a prediction procedure for the functional linear quantileregression model by using partial quantile covariance techniques and develop asimple partial quantile regression (SIMPQR) algorithm to efficiently extractpartial quantile regression (PQR) basis for estimating functional coefficients.We further extend our partial quantile covariance techniques to functionalcomposite quantile regression (CQR) defining partial composite quantilecovariance. There are three major contributions. (1) We define partial quantilecovariance between two scalar variables through linear quantile regression. Wecompute PQR basis by sequentially maximizing the partial quantile covariancebetween the response and projections of functional covariates. (2) In order toefficiently extract PQR basis, we develop a SIMPQR algorithm analogous tosimple partial least squares (SIMPLS). (3) Under the homoscedasticityassumption, we extend our techniques to partial composite quantile covarianceand use it to find the partial composite quantile regression (PCQR) basis. TheSIMPQR algorithm is then modified to obtain the SIMPCQR algorithm. Twosimulation studies show the superiority of our proposed methods. Two real datafrom ADHD-200 sample and ADNI are analyzed using our proposed methods.

Invariant Clusters for Hybrid Systems

  In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically compute invariantclusters for semialgebraic hybrid systems. An invariant cluster for an ordinarydifferential equation (ODE) is a multivariate polynomial invariant g(u,x)=0,parametric in u, which can yield an infinite number of concrete invariants byassigning different values to u so that every trajectory of the system can beoverapproximated precisely by a union of concrete invariants. For semialgebraicsystems, which involve ODEs with multivariate polynomial vector flow, invariantclusters can be obtained by first computing the remainder of the Lie derivativeof a template multivariate polynomial w.r.t. its Groebner basis and thensolving the system of polynomial equations obtained from the coefficients ofthe remainder. Based on invariant clusters and sum-of-squares (SOS)programming, we present a new method for the safety verification of hybridsystems. Experiments on nonlinear benchmark systems from biology and controltheory show that our approach is effective and efficient.

Variational Smoothing in Recurrent Neural Network Language Models

  We present a new theoretical perspective of data noising in recurrent neuralnetwork language models (Xie et al., 2017). We show that each variant of datanoising is an instance of Bayesian recurrent neural networks with a particularvariational distribution (i.e., a mixture of Gaussians whose weights depend onstatistics derived from the corpus such as the unigram distribution). We usethis insight to propose a more principled method to apply at prediction timeand propose natural extensions to data noising under the variational framework.In particular, we propose variational smoothing with tied input and outputembedding matrices and an element-wise variational smoothing method. Weempirically verify our analysis on two benchmark language modeling datasets anddemonstrate performance improvements over existing data noising methods.

Emergent Quantum Dynamics of Vortex Line under Linear Local Induction  Approximation

  Using the linear local induction approximation, we investigated theself-induced motion of a vortex line that corresponds to the motion of aparticle in quantum mechanics. Concerning Kelvin waves, the effectiveSchr\"odinger equation, physical quantities operators, and the correspondingpath-integral formula are obtained. The vortex line-particle mapping may helpin understanding particle motion in quantum mechanics.

High Dimensional Robust Inference for Cox Regression Models

  We consider high-dimensional inference for potentially misspecified Coxproportional hazard models based on low dimensional results by Lin and Wei[1989]. A de-sparsified Lasso estimator is proposed based on the log partiallikelihood function and shown to converge to a pseudo-true parameter vector.Interestingly, the sparsity of the true parameter can be inferred from that ofthe above limiting parameter. Moreover, each component of the above(non-sparse) estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal with a variancethat can be consistently estimated even under model misspecifications. In somecases, this asymptotic distribution leads to valid statistical inferenceprocedures, whose empirical performances are illustrated through numericalexamples.

Dielectric Behavior of Nonspherical Cell Suspensions

  Recent experiments revealed that the dielectric dispersion spectrum offission yeast cells in a suspension was mainly composed of two sub-dispersions.The low-frequency sub-dispersion depended on the cell length, whereas thehigh-frequency one was independent of it. The cell shape effect wasqualitatively simulated by an ellipsoidal cell model. However, the comparisonbetween theory and experiment was far from being satisfactory. In an attempt toclose up the gap between theory and experiment, we considered the morerealistic cells of spherocylinders, i.e., circular cylinders with twohemispherical caps at both ends. We have formulated a Green function formalismfor calculating the spectral representation of cells of finite length. TheGreen function can be reduced because of the azimuthal symmetry of the cell.This simplification enables us to calculate the dispersion spectrum and henceaccess the effect of cell structure on the dielectric behavior of cellsuspensions.

Nonlinear ac response of anisotropic composites

  When a suspension consisting of dielectric particles having nonlinearcharacteristics is subjected to a sinusoidal (ac) field, the electricalresponse will in general consist of ac fields at frequencies of thehigher-order harmonics. These ac responses will also be anisotropic. In thiswork, a self-consistent formalism has been employed to compute the induceddipole moment for suspensions in which the suspended particles have nonlinearcharacteristics, in an attempt to investigate the anisotropy in the acresponse. The results showed that the harmonics of the induced dipole momentand the local electric field are both increased as the anisotropy increases forthe longitudinal field case, while the harmonics are decreased as theanisotropy increases for the transverse field case. These results arequalitatively understood with the spectral representation. Thus, by measuringthe ac responses both parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropicaxis of the field-induced structures, it is possible to perform a real-timemonitoring of the field-induced aggregation process.

Spectral Representation Theory for Dielectric Behavior of Nonspherical  Cell Suspensions

  Recent experiments revealed that the dielectric dispersion spectrum offission yeast cells in a suspension was mainly composed of two sub-dispersions.The low-frequency sub-dispersion depended on the cell length, while thehigh-frequency one was independent of it. The cell shape effect was simulatedby an ellipsoidal cell model but the comparison between theory and experimentwas far from being satisfactory. Prompted by the discrepancy, we proposed theuse of spectral representation to analyze more realistic cell models. Weadopted a shell-spheroidal model to analyze the effects of the cell membrane.It is found that the dielectric property of the cell membrane has only a minoreffect on the dispersion magnitude ratio and the characteristic frequencyratio. We further included the effect of rotation of dipole induced by anexternal electric field, and solved the dipole-rotation spheroidal model in thespectral representation. Good agreement between theory and experiment has beenobtained.

Field-induced structure transformation in electrorheological solids

  We have computed the local electric field in a body-centered tetragonal (BCT)lattice of point dipoles via the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation, in an attempt toexamine the effects of a structure transformation on the local field strength.For the ground state of an electrorheological solid of hard spheres, weidentified a novel structure transformation from the BCT to the face-centeredcubic (FCC) lattices by changing the uniaxial lattice constant c under the hardsphere constraint. In contrast to the previous results, the local fieldexhibits a non-monotonic transition from BCT to FCC. As c increases from theBCT ground state, the local field initially decreases rapidly towards theisotropic value at the body-centered cubic lattice, decreases further, reachinga minimum value and increases, passing through the isotropic value again at anintermediate lattice, reaches a maximum value and finally decreases to the FCCvalue. An experimental realization of the structure transformation issuggested. Moreover, the change in the local field can lead to a generalizedClausius-Mossotti equation for the BCT lattices.

Computer simulations of electrorheological fluids in the dipole-induced  dipole model

  We have employed the multiple image method to compute the interparticle forcefor a polydisperse electrorheological (ER) fluid in which the suspendedparticles can have various sizes and different permittivites. The point-dipole(PD) approximation being routinely adopted in computer simulation of ER fluidsis shown to err considerably when the particles approach and finally touch dueto multipolar interactions. The PD approximation becomes even worse when thedielectric contrast between the particles and the host medium is large. Fromthe results, we show that the dipole-induced-dipole (DID) model yields verygood agreements with the multiple image results for a wide range of dielectriccontrasts and polydispersity. As an illustration, we have employed the DIDmodel to simulate the athermal aggregation of particles in ER fluids both inuniaxial and rotating fields. We find that the aggregation time issignificantly reduced. The DID model accounts for multipolar interactionpartially and is simple to use in computer simulation of ER fluids.

First-Principles Approach to Electrorotation Assay

  We have presented a theoretical study of electrorotation assay based on thespectral representation theory. We consider unshelled and shelled spheroidalparticles as an extension to spherical ones. From the theoretical analysis, wefind that the coating can change the characteristic frequency at which themaximum rotational angular velocity occurs. The shift in the characteristicfrequency is attributed to a change in the dielectric properties of thebead-coating complex with respect to those of the uncoated particles. Byadjusting the dielectric properties and the thickness of the coating, it ispossible to obtain good agreement between our theoretical predictions and theassay data.

Electrorotation of a pair of spherical particles

  We present a theoretical study of electrorotation (ER) of two sphericalparticles under the action of a rotating electric field. When the two particlesapproach and finally touch, the mutual polarization interaction between theparticles leads to a change in the dipole moment of the individual particle andhence the ER spectrum, as compared to that of the well-separated particles. Themutual polarization effects are captured by the method of multiple images. Fromthe theoretical analysis, we find that the mutual polarization effects canchange the characteristic frequency at which the maximum angular velocity ofelectrorotation occurs. The numerical results can be understood in the spectralrepresentation theory.

Relaxation of surface charge on rotating dielectric spheres:  Implications on dynamic electrorheological effects

  We have examined the effect of an oscillatory rotation of a polarizeddielectric particle. The rotational motion leads to a re-distribution of thepolarization charge on the surface of the particle. We show that the timeaveraged steady-state dipole moment is along the field direction, but itsmagnitude is reduced by a factor which depends on the angular velocity ofrotation. As a result, the rotational motion of the particle reduces theelectrorheological effect. We further assume that the relaxation of polarizedcharge is arised from a finite conductivity of the particle or host medium. Wecalculate the relaxation time based on the Maxwell-Wagner theory, suitablygeneralized to include the rotational motion. Analytic expressions for thereduction factor and the relaxation time are given and their dependence on theangular velocity of rotation will be discussed.

Dielectric behavior of oblate spheroidal particles: Application to  erythrocytes suspensions

  We have investigated the effect of particle shape on the eletrorotation (ER)spectrum of living cells suspensions. In particular, we consider coated oblatespheroidal particles and present a theoretical study of ER based on thespectral representation theory. Analytic expressions for the characteristicfrequency as well as the dispersion strength can be obtained, thus simplifyingthe fitting of experimental data on oblate spheroidal cells that abound in theliterature. From the theoretical analysis, we find that the cell shape, coatingas well as material parameters can change the ER spectrum. We demonstrate goodagreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental data on humanerthrocytes suspensions.

Computer simulations of polydisperse ER fluids in DID model

  The theoretical investigations on electrorheological (ER) fluids are usuallyconcentrated on monodisperse systems. Real ER fluids must be polydisperse innature, i.e., the suspended particles can have various sizes and/or differentdielectric constants. An initial approach for these studies would be thepoint-dipole (PD) approximation, which is known to err considerably when theparticles approach and finally touch due to multipolar interactions. In arecent work, we proposed a dipole-induced-dipole (DID) model for computersimulation of ER fluids, which was shown to be both more accurate than the PDmodel and easy to use. The DID model was applied to simulate the athermalaggregation of particles in ER fluids and the aggregation time was found to besignificantly reduced as compared to the PD model. In this work, we will reportresults for the case when the dielectric contrasts of some particles can benegative. In which case, the direction of the force is reversed. Moreover, theinclusion of DID force further complicates the results because the symmetrybetween positive and negative contrasts will be broken by the presence ofdipole-induced interactions.

Heterogeneous aggregation in binary colloidal alloys

  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been employed to study thenonequilibrium structure formation of two types of particles in a colloidalsuspension, driven by type-dependent forces. We examined the time evolution ofstructure formation as well as the structural properties of the resultingaggregation by studying the radial distribution function (RDF). The resultingaggregation is well described by a binary colloidal gelation. We compared thestructural properties to those for one type of particles. From the MD results,it is evident that there are significant differences between the RDF's of thetwo cases. Moreover, we found that the average coordination number is generallylarger in the monodisperse case for all area fractions considered. Thus, bymeans of heterogeneous aggregation, it is possible to obtain a wide variety ofstructures while more close-packed structures are formed for monodispersecolloidal aggregation.

Many-body dipole-induced dipole model for electrorheological fluids

  Theoretical investigations on electrorheological (ER) fluids usually rely oncomputer simulations. An initial approach for these studies would be thepoint-dipole (PD) approximation, which is known to err considerably when theparticles approach and finally touch due to many-body and multipolarinteractions. Thus various work attempted to go beyond the PD model. Beingbeyond the PD model, previous attempts have been restricted to eitherlocal-field effects only or multipolar effects only, but not both. Forinstance, we recently proposed a dipole-induced-dipole (DID) model which isshown to be both more accurate than the PD model and easy to use. This work isnecessary because the many-body (local-field) effect is included to put forththe many-body DID model. The results show that the multipolar interactions canindeed be dominant over the dipole interaction, while the local-field effectmay yield an important correction.

Dielectric response of spherical particles of graded materials

  We have studied the effective response of composites of spherical particleswith a dielectric profile which varies along the radius of the particles. Wedeveloped a differential effective dipole theory to compute the dipole momentof individual spherical particle and hence the effective dielectric response ofa dilute suspension. The theory has been applied to two model dielectricprofiles. Moreover, we compare the approximate results with the exact resultsof the power-law profile and the agreement is excellent.

Ground state of a polydisperse electrorheological solid: Beyond the  dipole approximation

  The ground state of an electrorheological (ER) fluid has been studied basedon our recently proposed dipole-induced dipole (DID) model. We obtained ananalytic expression of the interaction between chains of particles which are ofthe same or different dielectric constants. The effects of dielectric constantson the structure formation in monodisperse and polydisperse electrorheologicalfluids are studied in a wide range of dielectric contrasts between theparticles and the base fluid. Our results showed that the establishedbody-centered tetragonal ground state in monodisperse ER fluids may becomeunstable due to a polydispersity in the particle dielectric constants. Whileour results agree with that of the fully multipole theory, the DID model ismuch simpler, which offers a basis for computer simulations in polydisperse ERfluids.

First-principles approach to dielectric response of graded spherical  particles

  We have studied the effective response of composites of spherical particleseach having a dielectric profile which varies along the radius of theparticles. We developed a first-principles approach to compute the dipolemoment of the individual spherical particle and hence the effective dielectricresponse of a dilute suspension. The approach has been applied to two modeldielectric profiles, for which exact solutions are available. Moreover, we usedthe exact results to validate the results from the differential effectivedipole approximation, recently developed to treat graded spherical particles ofan arbitrary dielectric profile. Excellent agreement between the two approacheswere obtained. While the focus of this work has been on dielectric responses,the approach is equally applicable to analogous systems such as theconductivity and elastic problems.

Optical nonlinearity enhancement of graded metallic films

  The effective linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibility of gradedmetallic films with weak nonlinearity have been investigated. Due to the simplegeometry, we were able to derive exactly the local field inside the gradedstructures having a Drude dielectric gradation profile. We calculated theeffective linear dielectric constant and third-order nonlinear susceptibility.We investigated the surface plasmon resonant effect on the optical absorption,optical nonlinearity enhancement, and figure of merit of graded metallic films.It is found that the presence of gradation in metallic films yields a broadresonant plasmon band in the optical region, resulting in a large enhancementof the optical nonlinearity and hence a large figure of merit. We suggestexperiments be done to check our theoretical predictions, because gradedmetallic films can be fabricated more easily than graded particles.

Dielectric behaviour of graded spherical cells with an intrinsic  dispersion

  The dielectric properties of single-shell spherical cells with an intrinsicdielectric dispersion has been investigated. By means of the dielectricdispersion spectral representation (DDSR) for the Clausius-Mossotti (CM)factor, we express the dispersion strengths as well as the characteristicfrequencies of the CM factor analytically in terms of the parameters of thecell model. These analytic expressions enable us to assess the influence ofvarious model parameters on the electrokinetics of cells. Various interestingbehaviours have been reported. We extend our considerations to a more realisticcell model with a graded core, which can have spatial gradients in theconductivity and/or permittivity. To this end, we address the effects of agraded profile in a small-gradient expansion in the framework of DDSR.

Effective conductivity of composites of graded spherical particles

  We have employed the first-principles approach to compute the effectiveresponse of composites of graded spherical particles of arbitrary conductivityprofiles. We solve the boundary-value problem for the polarizability of thegraded particles and obtain the dipole moment as well as the multipole moments.We provide a rigorous proof of an {\em ad hoc} approximate method based on thedifferential effective multipole moment approximation (DEMMA) in which thedifferential effective dipole approximation (DEDA) is a special case. Themethod will be applied to an exactly solvable graded profile. We show that DEDAand DEMMA are indeed exact for graded spherical particles.

Giant enhanced optical nonlinearity of colloidal nanocrystals with a  graded-index host

  The effective linear and third-order nonlinear optical properties of metalliccolloidal crystal immersed in a graded-index host fluid are investigatedtheoretically. The local electric fields are extracted self-consistently basedon the layer-to-layer interactions, which are readily given by the Leknersummation method. The resultant optical absorption and nonlinearity enhancementshow a series of sharp peaks, which merge in a broadened resonant band. Thesharp peaks become a continuous band for increasing packing density and numberof layers. We believe that the sharp peaks arise from the in-plane dipolarinteractions and the surface plasmon resonance, whereas the continuous band isdue to the presence of the gradient in the host refractive index. These resultshave not been observed in homogeneous and randomly-dispersed colloids, and thuswould be of great interest in optical nanomaterial engineering.

Algorithms for polynomials in two variables

  Vladimir Shpilrain and Jie-Tai Yu have asked for an effective algorithm todecide if two elements of C[x,y] are related by an automorphism of C[x,y]. Wedescribe here an efficient algorithm that decides this question and finds theautomorphism if it exists. The algorithm is due to the second author, whodescribed it in terms of Newton polygons, with C replaceable by a field of anycharacteristic. Here we describe it in terms of splice diagrams, which gainssome efficiency at cost of generality (it currently applies only tocharacteristic zero). Part of the purpose of this paper is to give anexposition of the use of splice diagrams in studying C[x,y].

Optical response of strongly coupled metal nanoparticles in dimer arrays

  The optical responses of structured array of noble-metal nanoparticle dimersimmersed in a glass matrix are investigated theoretically, motivated by therecent experimental observation of the splitting of the surface plasmon bandsin silver arrays. To capture the strong electromagnetic coupling between thetwo approaching particles in a silver dimer, the spectral representation of themultiple image formula has been used, and a semiclassical description of thesilver dielectric function is adopted from the literature. The splitting ofplasmon resonance band of the incident longitudinal and transverse polarizedlight is found to be strongly dependent on the particle diameter and theirseparation. Our results are shown in accord with the recent experimentalobservation. Moreover, a large redshift for the longitudinal polarization canbe reproduced. The reflectivity spectrum is further calculated for a dilutesuspension of dimer arrays.

Tunable photonic Bloch oscillations in electrically modulated photonic  crystals

  We exploit theoretically the occurrence and tunability of photonic Blochoscillations (PBOs) in one-dimensional photonic crystals (PCs) containingnonlinear composites. Because of the enhanced third-order nonlinearity (Kerrtype nonlinearity) of composites, photons undergo oscillations inside tiltedphotonic bands, which are achieved by the application of graded external pumpelectric fields on such PCs, varying along the direction perpendicular to thesurface of layers. The tunability of PBOs (including amplitude and period) isreadily achieved by changing the field gradient. With an appropriate gradedpump AC or DC electric field, terahertz PBOs can appear and cover a terahertzband in electromagnetic spectrum.

Localization of electric field distribution in graded core-shell  metamaterials

  The local electric field distribution has been investigated in a core-shellcylindrical metamaterial structure under the illumination of a uniform incidentoptical field. The structure consists of a homogeneous dielectric core, a shellof graded metal-dielectric metamaterial, embedded in a uniform matrix. In thequasi-static limit, the permittivity of the metamaterial is given by the gradedDrude model. The local electric potentials and hence the electric fields havebeen derived exactly and analytically in terms of hyper-geometric functions.Our results showed that the peak of the electric field inside the cylindricalshell can be confined in a desired position by varying the frequency of theoptical field and the parameters of the graded profiles. Thus, by fabricatinggraded metamaterials, it is possible to control electric field distributionspatially. We offer an intuitive explanation for the gradation-controlledelectric field distribution.

Tunable Localization and Oscillation of Coupled Plasmon Waves in Graded  Plasmonic Chains

  The localization (confinement) of coupled plasmon modes, named as gradons,has been studied in metal nanoparticle chains immersed in a graded dielectrichost. We exploited the time evolution of various initial wavepackets formed bythe linear combination of the coupled modes. We found an important interplaybetween the localization of plasmonic gradons and the oscillation in suchgraded plasmonic chains. Unlike in optical superlattices, gradient cannotalways lead to Bloch oscillations, which can only occur for wavepacketsconsisting of particular types of gradons. Moreover, the wavepackets willundergo different forms of oscillations. The correspondence can be applied todesign a variety of optical devices by steering among various oscillations.

Steering between Bloch oscillation and dipole oscillation in parabolic  optical waveguide arrays

  We study the optical oscillations of supermodes in planar optical waveguidearrays with parabolically graded propagation constant in individual waveguideinteracting through nearest neighbor couplings. In these arrays, we haveidentified a transition between a symmetric dipole oscillation (DO) and asymmetry-breaking Bloch oscillation (BO) under appropriate conditions. Thereexist obvious correspondences between gradon localization and various opticaloscillations. By virtue of an analogue between the oscillation of opticalsystem and that of a plane pendulum, we propose a shift of the graded profileto cause a transition from BO to DO. We confirm the optical transition by meansof Hamiltonian optics, as well as by the field evolution of the supermodes. Theresults offer great potential applications in optical switching, which can beapplied to design suitable optical devices.

Tunable Hybridization at Mid Zone and Anomalous Bloch-Zener Oscillations  in Optical Waveguide Ladders

  We have studied the optical oscillation and tunneling of light waves inoptical waveguide ladders formed by two coupled planar optical waveguidearrays. For the band structure, a mid-zone gap is formed due to bandhybridization and its wavenumber position can be tuned throughout the wholeBrillouin zone, which is different from the Bragg gap. By imposing a gradientin the propagation constant in each array, Bloch-Zener oscillation (BZO) isrealized with Zener tunneling between the bands occurring at mid zone, which iscontrary to the common BZO with tunneling at the center or edge of theBrillouin zone. The occurrence of BZO is demonstrated by using thefield-evolution analysis. The tunable hybridization at mid zone enhances thetunability of BZO in the optical waveguide ladders. This work is of general andfundamental importance in understanding the coherent phenomena in latticestructures.

Photonic Bloch-dipole-Zener Oscillations in Binary Parabolic Optical  Waveguide Arrays

  We have studied the propagation and Zener tunneling of light in the binaryparabolic optical waveguide array (BPOWA), which consists of two evanescentlycoupled dissimilar optical waveguides. Due to Bragg reflections, BPOWA attainstwo minibands separated by a minigap at the zone boundary. Various coherentsuperpositions of optical oscillations and Zener tunneling occur for differentparameters on the phase diagram. In particular, Bloch-Zener oscillation and adifferent type of Bloch-dipole-Zener oscillation are obtained by thefield-evolution analysis. The results may have potential applications inoptical splitting and waveguiding devices and shed light on the coherentphenomena in optical lattices.

Superconductivity of topological insulator Bi2Se3 at high pressures

  The pressure induced superconductivity and structural evolution for Bi2Se3single crystal have been studied. The emergence of superconductivity with onsettransition temperature (Tc) about 4.4K is observed around 12GPa. Tc increasesrapidly to the highest 8.5K at 16GPa, decreases to 6.5K at 21GPa, then keepalmost constant. It is found that Tc versus pressure is closely related to thecarrier density which increases by more than two orders of magnitude from 2GPato 23GPa. High pressure synchrotron radiation measurements reveal structuretransitions occur around 12GPa, 20GPa, and above 29GPa, respectively. A phasediagram of superconductivity versus pressure is obtained.

Nondiffractive feature of $γN\to ρ^\pm N$ with $ρ$-meson  electromagnetic multipole moments

  We investigate photoproduction of charged $\rho$ off the nucleon using$\rho(770)+\pi(140)$ Regge pole exchanges by considering the $\rho$-mesonelectromagnetic multipole moments. The significance of the Ward identity at the$\gamma\rho\rho$ vertex is emphasized for current conservation in the process.Given $\pi$ exchange with the well-known coupling constants for $\gamma\pi\rho$and $\pi NN$, we analyze the role of the $\rho$ exchange in the $\gamma p\to\rho^+n$ and $\gamma n\to\rho^-p$ processes without model-dependences exceptfor the magnetic moment $\mu_{\rho^\pm}=\pm2.01$ and electric quadrupole moment${\cal Q}_{\rho^\pm}=\pm0.027$ fm$^2$ taken from theoretical estimates. Thenondiffractive feature of both cross sections is reproduced with a rapiddecrease beyond the resonance region by the dominance of $\pi$ exchange overthe $\rho$\,. % Cross sections for differential and density matrix elements arepresented to compare with existing data. The parity and photon polarizationasymmetries are predicted to demonstrate the apparent roles of the $\rho$-mesonelectromagnetic multipole moments.

Regge approach to the reaction of $γN \to K^* Λ$

  Photoproduction of $K^*$ vector mesons off nucleon is investigated within theRegge framework where the electromagnetic vertex of $\gamma K^*K^*$ fully takesinto account the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of spin-1$K^*$ vector meson. The $t$-channel $K^*(892)$, $K(494)$ and $\kappa(800)$meson exchanges are considered for the analysis of the production mechanism.The experimentally observed rapid decrease of the cross sections for the$\gamma p \to K^{*+} \Lambda$ reaction beyond the resonance region is wellreproduced by the dominance of the exchange of $K$-meson trajectory. The roleof the scalar $\kappa$-meson trajectory is found to be minor in both $\gamma p$and $\gamma n$ reactions. The cross sections for the $\gamma n \to K^{*0}\Lambda$ reaction are predicted to be about twice those of the $\gamma p \toK^{*+}\Lambda$ reaction. The role of the $K^*$ electromagnetic multipoles andthe proton anomalous magnetic moment is studied through the total anddifferential cross sections and spin/parity asymmetries. We suggest themeasurement of the photon polarization asymmetry as a tool for identifying therole of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the $K^*$ vectormeson.

Role of $σ$ exchange in the $γp\to φp$ process and  scaling with the $f_1$ axial vector meson from a Reggeized model

  We investigate the role driven by the scalar meson $\sigma$ exchange in thephotoproduction of the vector meson $\phi$(1020) off a proton by using aReggeized model. Based on the $\pi^0(135)+\sigma(500)+f_2(1270)$+Pomeronexchanges, we demonstrate that the $\sigma$ exchange plays the role toreproduce the bump structure at the forward angle in the differential crosssection as well as the peaking behavior in the total cross section observed inthe CLAS Collaboration. We also discuss the possible observation of the scaledcross section $s^7d\sigma /dt$ at the production angle $\theta=90^{\circ}$ fromthe CLAS data. It is found that the axial vector meson $f_1(1285)$ exchangewith the trajectory $\alpha_{f_1}(t)=0.028\,t+0.9\pm0.2$ arising from the axialanomaly of the QCD vacuum plays the role to clarify the scaling up to 5 GeV.

The Reggeized model for $γp \to ρ^- Δ^{++}(1232)$  photoproduction

  We construct a model for the reaction process $\gamma p\to\rho^-\Delta^{++}$by utilizing the Reggeization of the $t$-channel meson exchange and present theanalysis of the existing data at high energies. Based on the simple $\pi+\rho$exchanges where the $t$-channel $\rho$ exchange is conserved with the$u$-channel $\Delta$-pole in addition to the $s$-channel proton pole and thecontact term, we discuss the convergence of the reaction cross section at highenergy in association with the gauge prescription for the $u$-channel$\Delta$-pole as well as the proton-pole in the $s$-channel. The roles of theelectromagnetic (EM) multipole moments of the $\Delta$-baryon and $\rho$-mesonare analyzed. The agreement of the present calculation with the data of totaland differential cross sections and spin density matrix elements for the$\gamma p\to \rho^-\Delta^{++}$ process are shown. Model predictions for themeasurements of the electromagnetic moments of the $\rho$ and $\Delta$ aregiven to the photon polarization asymmetry.

Photoproduction of $γN\to K^+ Σ^*(1385)$ in the Reggeized  framework

  Photoproduction of $ K\Sigma^{*}(1385)$ on the nucleon is investigated withinthe Regge framework and the reaction mechanism is analyzed based on the dataexisting in the channels $\gamma p\to K^+\Sigma^{*0}$ and $\gamma n\toK^+\Sigma^{*-}$. The Reggeization of the $t$-channel meson exchanges$K(494)+K^*(892)+K_2^*(1430)$ is employed to construct the photoproductionamplitude. The Rarita-Schwinger formalism is applied for the spin-3/2$^+$strangeness-baryon $\Sigma^*$ with a special gauge prescription utilized forthe convergence of these reaction processes. Within a set of coupling constantsdetermined from the symmetry arguement for the $K$ and $K^*$ and from theduality and vector dominance for the $K_2^*$, the data of the both processesare reproduced to a good degree. The production mechanism of these processesare featured by the dominance of the contact term plus the $K$ exchange withthe role of the $K_2^*$ following rather than the $K^*$.

Sparse Wavelet Estimation in Quantile Regression with Multiple  Functional Predictors

  In this manuscript, we study quantile regression in partial functional linearmodel where response is scalar and predictors include both scalars and multiplefunctions. Wavelet basis are adopted to better approximate functional slopeswhile effectively detect local features. The sparse group lasso penalty isimposed to select important functional predictors while capture sharedinformation among them. The estimation problem can be reformulated into astandard second-order cone program and then solved by an interior point method.We also give a novel algorithm by using alternating direction method ofmultipliers (ADMM) which was recently employed by many researchers in solvingpenalized quantile regression problems. The asymptotic properties such as theconvergence rate and prediction error bound have been established. Simulationsand a real data from ADHD-200 fMRI data are investigated to show thesuperiority of our proposed method.

An Alternative Approach to Functional Linear Partial Quantile Regression

  We have previously proposed the partial quantile regression (PQR) predictionprocedure for functional linear model by using partial quantile covariancetechniques and developed the simple partial quantile regression (SIMPQR)algorithm to efficiently extract PQR basis for estimating functionalcoefficients. However, although the PQR approach is considered as an attractivealternative to projections onto the principal component basis, there arecertain limitations to uncovering the corresponding asymptotic propertiesmainly because of its iterative nature and the non-differentiability of thequantile loss function. In this article, we propose and implement analternative formulation of partial quantile regression (APQR) for functionallinear model by using block relaxation method and finite smoothing techniques.The proposed reformulation leads to insightful results and motivates newtheory, demonstrating consistency and establishing convergence rates byapplying advanced techniques from empirical process theory. Two simulations andtwo real data from ADHD-200 sample and ADNI are investigated to show thesuperiority of our proposed methods.

Regge phenomenology of photoproduction of $π^-Δ^{++}$ and scaling  with saturation of trajectory

  In this work we investigate the reaction $\gamma p\to\pi^-\Delta^{++}$ in theReggeized model for $\pi(138)+\rho(775)+a_2(1320)$ exchanges in the$t$-channel. For a convergence of the reaction cross section at high energiesthe minimal forms of proton and $\Delta^{++}$ exchanges are introduced in thedirect and crossed channels for gauge invariance of $\pi$ Regge-pole exchange.The role of spin-2 tensor meson $a_2$ is found to be crucial to agree withexisting data at high energies. Electromagnetic multipoles of $\Delta^{++}$baryon are analyzed in the $\Delta$ resonance region. Based on the constituentscounting rule the scaled differential cross section at $E_\gamma=4$ GeV isreproduced with the Regge trajectory saturated at large momentum transfer $-t$.

Multi-level Attention Model for Weakly Supervised Audio Classification

  In this paper, we propose a multi-level attention model to solve the weaklylabelled audio classification problem. The objective of audio classification isto predict the presence or absence of audio events in an audio clip. Recently,Google published a large scale weakly labelled dataset called Audio Set, whereeach audio clip contains only the presence or absence of the audio events,without the onset and offset time of the audio events. Our multi-levelattention model is an extension to the previously proposed single-levelattention model. It consists of several attention modules applied onintermediate neural network layers. The output of these attention modules areconcatenated to a vector followed by a multi-label classifier to make the finalprediction of each class. Experiments shown that our model achieves a meanaverage precision (mAP) of 0.360, outperforms the state-of-the-art single-levelattention model of 0.327 and Google baseline of 0.314.
