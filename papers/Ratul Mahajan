Modeling Actuation Constraints for IoT Applications

  Internet of Things (IoT) promises to bring ease of monitoring, betterefficiency and innovative services across many domains with connected devicesaround us. With information from critical parts of infrastructure and powerfulcloud-based data analytics, many applications can be developed to gain insightsabout IoT systems as well as transform their capabilities. Actuationapplications form an essential part of these IoT systems, as they enableautomation as well as fast low-level decision making. However, modern IoTsystems are designed for data acquisition, and actuation applications areimplemented in an ad-hoc manner. We identify modeling constraints in asystematic manner as indispensable to support actuation applications becauseconstraints encompass high-level policies dictated by laws of physics, legalpolicies, user preferences. We explore data models for constraints inIoT systemwith the example of a home heating system and illustrate the challenges inenforcing these constraints in theIoT system architecture.

Control Plane Compression

  We develop an algorithm capable of compressing large networks into a smallerones with similar control plane behavior: For every stable routing solution inthe large, original network, there exists a corresponding solution in thecompressed network, and vice versa. Our compression algorithm preserves a widevariety of network properties including reachability, loop freedom, and pathlength. Consequently, operators may speed up network analysis, based onsimulation, emulation, or verification, by analyzing only the compressednetwork. Our approach is based on a new theory of control plane equivalence. Weimplement these ideas in a tool called Bonsai and apply it to real andsynthetic networks. Bonsai can shrink real networks by over a factor of 5 andspeed up analysis by several orders of magnitude.
