A Game Theoretic Framework for Incentives in P2P Systems

  Peer-To-Peer (P2P) networks are self-organizing, distributed systems, with nocentralized authority or infrastructure. Because of the voluntaryparticipation, the availability of resources in a P2P system can be highlyvariable and unpredictable. In this paper, we use ideas from Game Theory tostudy the interaction of strategic and rational peers, and propose adifferential service-based incentive scheme to improve the system'sperformance.

Capturing an Evader in Polygonal Environments: A Complete Information  Game

  Suppose an unpredictable evader is free to move around in a polygonalenvironment of arbitrary complexity that is under full camera surveillance. Howmany pursuers, each with the same maximum speed as the evader, are necessaryand sufficient to guarantee a successful capture of the evader? The pursuersalways know the evader's current position through the camera network, but needto physically reach the evader to capture it. We allow the evader the knowledgeof the current positions of all the pursuers as well---this accords with thestandard worst-case analysis model, but also models a practical situation wherethe evader has "hacked" into the surveillance system.  Our main result is to prove that three pursuers are always sufficient andsometimes necessary to capture the evader. The bound is independent of thenumber of vertices or holes in the polygonal environment. The result should becontrasted with the incomplete information pursuit-evasion where at least{\Omega}(\surd h + log n) pursuers are required just for detecting the evaderin an environment with n vertices and h holes.

Power Aware Routing for Sensor Databases

  Wireless sensor networks offer the potential to span and monitor largegeographical areas inexpensively. Sensor network databases like TinyDB are thedominant architectures to extract and manage data in such networks. Sincesensors have significant power constraints (battery life), and highcommunication costs, design of energy efficient communication algorithms is ofgreat importance. The data flow in a sensor database is very different fromdata flow in an ordinary network and poses novel challenges in designingefficient routing algorithms. In this work we explore the problem of energyefficient routing for various different types of database queries and show thatin general, this problem is NP-complete. We give a constant factorapproximation algorithm for one class of query, and for other queries giveheuristic algorithms. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms bysimulation and demonstrate their near optimal performance for various networksizes.

Distributed Navigation Algorithms for Sensor Networks

  We propose efficient distributed algorithms to aid navigation of a userthrough a geographic area covered by sensors. The sensors sense the level ofdanger at their locations and we use this information to find a safe path forthe user through the sensor field. Traditional distributed navigationalgorithms rely upon flooding the whole network with packets to find an optimalsafe path. To reduce the communication expense, we introduce the concept of askeleton graph which is a sparse subset of the true sensor networkcommunication graph. Using skeleton graphs we show that it is possible to findapproximate safe paths with much lower communication cost. We give tighttheoretical guarantees on the quality of our approximation and by simulation,show the effectiveness of our algorithms in realistic sensor networksituations.

Untangling the Braid: Finding Outliers in a Set of Streams

  Monitoring the performance of large shared computing systems such as thecloud computing infrastructure raises many challenging algorithmic problems.One common problem is to track users with the largest deviation from the norm(outliers), for some measure of performance. Taking a stream-computingperspective, we can think of each user's performance profile as a stream ofnumbers (such as response times), and the aggregate performance profile of theshared infrastructure as a "braid" of these intermixed streams. The monitoringsystem's goal then is to untangle this braid sufficiently to track the top koutliers. This paper investigates the space complexity of one-pass algorithmsfor approximating outliers of this kind, proves lower bounds using multi-partycommunication complexity, and proposes small-memory heuristic algorithms. Onone hand, stream outliers are easily tracked for simple measures, such as maxor min, but our theoretical results rule out even good approximations for mostof the natural measures such as average, median, or the quantiles. On the otherhand, we show through simulation that our proposed heuristics perform quitewell for a variety of synthetic data.

k-Capture in Multiagent Pursuit Evasion, or the Lion and the Hyenas

  We consider the following generalization of the classical pursuit-evasionproblem, which we call k-capture. A group of n pursuers (hyenas) wish tocapture an evader (lion) who is free to move in an m-dimensional Euclideanspace, the pursuers and the evader can move with the same maximum speed, and atleast k pursuers must simultaneously reach the evader's location to capture it.If fewer than k pursuers reach the evader, then those pursuers get destroyed bythe evader. Under what conditions can the evader be k-captured? We study thisproblem in the discrete time, continuous space model and prove that k-captureis possible if and only there exists a time when the evader lies in theinterior of the pursuers' k-Hull. When the pursuit occurs inside a compact,convex subset of the Euclidean space, we show through an easy constructivestrategy that k-capture is always possible.

Trackability with Imprecise Localization

  Imagine a tracking agent $P$ who wants to follow a moving target $Q$ in$d$-dimensional Euclidean space. The tracker has access to a noisy locationsensor that reports an estimate $\tilde{Q}(t)$ of the target's true location$Q(t)$ at time $t$, where $||Q(T) - \tilde{Q}(T)||$ represents the sensor'slocalization error. We study the limits of tracking performance under this kindof sensing imprecision. In particular, we investigate (1) what is $P$'s beststrategy to follow $Q$ if both $P$ and $Q$ can move with equal speed, (2) atwhat rate does the distance $||Q(t) - P(t)||$ grow under worst-caselocalization noise, (3) if $P$ wants to keep $Q$ within a prescribed distance$L$, how much faster does it need to move, and (4) what is the effect ofobstacles on the tracking performance, etc. Under a relative error model ofnoise, we are able to give upper and lower bounds for the worst-case trackingperformance, both with or without obstacles.

Convex Hulls under Uncertainty

  We study the convex-hull problem in a probabilistic setting, motivated by theneed to handle data uncertainty inherent in many applications, including sensordatabases, location-based services and computer vision. In our framework, theuncertainty of each input site is described by a probability distribution overa finite number of possible locations including a \emph{null} location toaccount for non-existence of the point. Our results include both exact andapproximation algorithms for computing the probability of a query point lyinginside the convex hull of the input, time-space tradeoffs for the membershipqueries, a connection between Tukey depth and membership queries, as well as anew notion of $\some$-hull that may be a useful representation of uncertainhulls.

Block Crossings in Storyline Visualizations

  Storyline visualizations help visualize encounters of the characters in astory over time. Each character is represented by an x-monotone curve that goesfrom left to right. A meeting is represented by having the characters thatparticipate in the meeting run close together for some time. In order to keepthe visual complexity low, rather than just minimizing pairwise crossings ofcurves, we propose to count block crossings, that is, pairs of intersectingbundles of lines.  Our main results are as follows. We show that minimizing the number of blockcrossings is NP-hard, and we develop, for meetings of bounded size, aconstant-factor approximation. We also present two fixed-parameter algorithmsand, for meetings of size 2, a greedy heuristic that we evaluateexperimentally.

Medians and Beyond: New Aggregation Techniques for Sensor Networks

  Wireless sensor networks offer the potential to span and monitor largegeographical areas inexpensively. Sensors, however, have significant powerconstraint (battery life), making communication very expensive. Anotherimportant issue in the context of sensor-based information systems is thatindividual sensor readings are inherently unreliable. In order to address thesetwo aspects, sensor database systems like TinyDB and Cougar enable in-networkdata aggregation to reduce the communication cost and improve reliability. Theexisting data aggregation techniques, however, are limited to relatively simpletypes of queries such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MIN/MAX. In this paper we proposea data aggregation scheme that significantly extends the class of queries thatcan be answered using sensor networks. These queries include (approximate)quantiles, such as the median, the most frequent data values, such as theconsensus value, a histogram of the data distribution, as well as rangequeries. In our scheme, each sensor aggregates the data it has received fromother sensors into a fixed (user specified) size message. We provide stricttheoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of the queries in terms ofthe message size. We evaluate the performance of our aggregation scheme bysimulation and demonstrate its accuracy, scalability and low resourceutilization for highly variable input data sets.

Memory Efficient De Bruijn Graph Construction

  Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies are revolutionizing genomicsresearch. Billions of short reads generated at low costs can be assembled forreconstructing the whole genomes. Unfortunately, the large memory footprint ofthe existing de novo assembly algorithms makes it challenging to get theassembly done for higher eukaryotes like mammals. In this work, we investigatethe memory issue of constructing de Bruijn graph, a core task in leadingassembly algorithms, which often consumes several hundreds of gigabytes memoryfor large genomes. We propose a disk-based partition method, called MinimumSubstring Partitioning (MSP), to complete the task using less than 10 gigabytesmemory, without runtime slowdown. MSP breaks the short reads into multiplesmall disjoint partitions so that each partition can be loaded into memory,processed individually and later merged with others to form a de Bruijn graph.By leveraging the overlaps among the k-mers (substring of length k), MSPachieves astonishing compression ratio: The total size of partitions is reducedfrom $\Theta(kn)$ to $\Theta(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the short readdatabase, and $k$ is the length of a $k$-mer. Experimental results show thatour method can build de Bruijn graphs using a commodity computer for anylarge-volume sequence dataset.

Observability of Lattice Graphs

  We consider a graph observability problem: how many edge colors are neededfor an unlabeled graph so that an agent, walking from node to node, canuniquely determine its location from just the observed color sequence of thewalk?  Specifically, let G(n,d) be an edge-colored subgraph of d-dimensional(directed or undirected) lattice of size n^d = n * n * ... * n. We say thatG(n,d) is t-observable if an agent can uniquely determine its current positionin the graph from the color sequence of any t-dimensional walk, where thedimension is the number of different directions spanned by the edges of thewalk. A walk in an undirected lattice G(n,d) has dimension between 1 and d, buta directed walk can have dimension between 1 and 2d because of two differentorientations for each axis.  We derive bounds on the number of colors needed for t-observability. Our mainresult is that Theta(n^(d/t)) colors are both necessary and sufficient fort-observability of G(n,d), where d is considered a constant.  This shows an interesting dependence of graph observability on the ratiobetween the dimension of the lattice and that of the walk. In particular, thenumber of colors for full-dimensional walks is Theta(n^(1/2)) in the directedcase, and Theta(n) in the undirected case, independent of the latticedimension.  All of our results extend easily to non-square lattices: given a latticegraph of size N = n_1 * n_2 * ... * n_d, the number of colors fort-observability is Theta (N^(1/t)).

Efficient Algorithms for k-Regret Minimizing Sets

  A regret minimizing set Q is a small size representation of a much largerdatabase P so that user queries executed on Q return answers whose scores arenot much worse than those on the full dataset. In particular, a k-regretminimizing set has the property that the regret ratio between the score of thetop-1 item in Q and the score of the top-k item in P is minimized, where thescore of an item is the inner product of the item's attributes with a user'sweight (preference) vector. The problem is challenging because we want to finda single representative set Q whose regret ratio is small with respect to allpossible user weight vectors.  We show that k-regret minimization is NP-Complete for all dimensions d >= 3.This settles an open problem from Chester et al. [VLDB 2014], and resolves thecomplexity status of the problem for all d: the problem is known to havepolynomial-time solution for d <= 2. In addition, we propose two newapproximation schemes for regret minimization, both with provable guarantees,one based on coresets and another based on hitting sets. We also carry outextensive experimental evaluation, and show that our schemes computeregret-minimizing sets comparable in size to the greedy algorithm proposed in[VLDB 14] but our schemes are significantly faster and scalable to large datasets.

Analytic tractography: A closed-form solution for estimating local white  matter connectivity with diffusion MRI

  White matter structures composed of myelinated axons in the living humanbrain are primarily studied by diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI). These long-rangeprojections are typically characterized in a two-step process: dMRI is used toestimate the orientation of axons within each voxel, then these localorientations are linked together to estimate the spatial extent of putativewhite matter bundles. Tractography, the process of tracing bundles acrossvoxels, either requires computationally expensive (probabilistic) simulationsto model uncertainty in fiber orientation or ignores it completely(deterministic). Probabilistic simulation necessarily generates a finite numberof trajectories, introducing "simulation error" to trajectory estimates. Herewe introduce a method to analytically (via a closed-form solution) take anorientation distribution function (ODF) from each voxel and calculate theprobabilities that a trajectory projects from a voxel into each directlyadjacent voxel. We validate our method by demonstrating that probabilisticsimulations converge to our analytically computed probabilities at the voxellevel as the number of simulated seeds increases. We show that our methodaccurately calculates the ground-truth transition probabilities from a phantomdataset. As a demonstration, we incoroporate our analytic method for voxeltransition probabilities into the Voxel Graph framework, creating aquantitative framework for assessing white matter structure that we call"analytic tractography". The long-range connectivity problem is reduced tofinding paths in a graph whose adjacency structure reflects voxel-to-voxelanalytic transition probabilities. We demonstrate this approach performscomparably to many current probabilistic and deterministic approaches at afraction of the computational cost. Open source software software is provided.

Approximating Dominating Set on Intersection Graphs of Rectangles and  L-frames

  We consider the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem on the intersectiongraphs of geometric objects. Even for simple and widely-used geometric objectssuch as rectangles, no sub-logarithmic approximation is known for the problemand (perhaps surprisingly) the problem is NP-hard even when all the rectanglesare "anchored" at a diagonal line with slope -1 (Pandit, CCCG 2017). In thispaper, we first show that for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the MDS problem on"diagonal-anchored" rectangles, providing the first $O(1)$-approximation forthe problem on a non-trivial subclass of rectangles. It is not hard to see thatthe MDS problem on "diagonal-anchored" rectangles is the same as the MDSproblem on "diagonal-anchored" L-frames: the union of a vertical and ahorizontal line segment that share an endpoint. As such, we also obtain a$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for the problem with "diagonal-anchored" L-frames.On the other hand, we show that the problem is APX-hard in case the inputL-frames intersect the diagonal, or the horizontal segments of the L-framesintersect a vertical line. However, as we show, the problem is linear-timesolvable in case the L-frames intersect a vertical as well as a horizontalline. Finally, we consider the MDS problem in the so-called "edge intersectionmodel" and obtain a number of results, answering two questions posed by Mehrabi(WAOA 2017).
