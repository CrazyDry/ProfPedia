Fairness-Aware Recommendation of Information Curators

  This paper highlights our ongoing efforts to create effective informationcurator recommendation models that can be personalized for individual users,while maintaining important fairness properties. Concretely, we introduce theproblem of information curator recommendation, provide a high-level overview ofa fairness-aware recommender, and introduce some preliminary experimentalevidence over a real-world Twitter dataset. We conclude with some thoughts onfuture directions.

Online Deception Detection Refueled by Real World Data Collection

  The lack of large realistic datasets presents a bottleneck in onlinedeception detection studies. In this paper, we apply a data collection methodbased on social network analysis to quickly identify high-quality deceptive andtruthful online reviews from Amazon. The dataset contains more than 10,000deceptive reviews and is diverse in product domains and reviewers. Using thisdataset, we explore effective general features for online deception detectionthat perform well across domains. We demonstrate that with generalized features- advertising speak and writing complexity scores - deception detectionperformance can be further improved by adding additional deceptive reviews fromassorted domains in training. Finally, reviewer level evaluation gives aninteresting insight into different deceptive reviewers' writing styles.

Tensor Completion Algorithms in Big Data Analytics

  Tensor completion is a problem of filling the missing or unobserved entriesof partially observed tensors. Due to the multidimensional character of tensorsin describing complex datasets, tensor completion algorithms and theirapplications have received wide attention and achievement in areas like datamining, computer vision, signal processing, and neuroscience. In this survey,we provide a modern overview of recent advances in tensor completion algorithmsfrom the perspective of big data analytics characterized by diverse variety,large volume, and high velocity. We characterize these advances from fourperspectives: general tensor completion algorithms, tensor completion withauxiliary information (variety), scalable tensor completion algorithms(volume), and dynamic tensor completion algorithms (velocity). Further, weidentify several tensor completion applications on real-world data-drivenproblems and present some common experimental frameworks popularized in theliterature. Our goal is to summarize these popular methods and introduce themto researchers and practitioners for promoting future research andapplications. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges and promisingresearch directions in this community for future exploration.

Pseudo-Implicit Feedback for Alleviating Data Sparsity in Top-K  Recommendation

  We propose PsiRec, a novel user preference propagation recommender thatincorporates pseudo-implicit feedback for enriching the original sparseimplicit feedback dataset. Three of the unique characteristics of PsiRec are:(i) it views user-item interactions as a bipartite graph and modelspseudo-implicit feedback from this perspective; (ii) its random walks-basedapproach extracts graph structure information from this bipartite graph, towardestimating pseudo-implicit feedback; and (iii) it adopts a Skip-gram inspiredmeasure of confidence in pseudo-implicit feedback that captures the pointwisemutual information between users and items. This pseudo-implicit feedback isultimately incorporated into a new latent factor model to estimate userpreference in cases of extreme sparsity. PsiRec results in improvements of21.5% and 22.7% in terms of Precision@10 and Recall@10 over state-of-the-artCollaborative Denoising Auto-Encoders. Our implementation is available athttps://github.com/heyunh2015/PsiRecICDM2018.

PageRank for ranking authors in co-citation networks

  Google's PageRank has created a new synergy to information retrieval for abetter ranking of Web pages. It ranks documents depending on the topology ofthe graphs and the weights of the nodes. PageRank has significantly advancedthe field of information retrieval and keeps Google ahead of competitors in thesearch engine market. It has been deployed in bibliometrics to evaluateresearch impact, yet few of these studies focus on the important impact of thedamping factor (d) for ranking purposes. This paper studies how varied dampingfactors in the PageRank algorithm can provide additional insight into theranking of authors in an author co-citation network. Furthermore, we proposeweighted PageRank algorithms. We select 108 most highly cited authors in theinformation retrieval (IR) area from the 1970s to 2008 to form the authorco-citation network. We calculate the ranks of these 108 authors based onPageRank with damping factor ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. In order to test therelationship between these different measures, we compare PageRank and weightedPageRank results with the citation ranking, h-index, and centrality measures.We found that in our author co-citation network, citation rank is highlycorrelated with PageRank's with different damping factors and also withdifferent PageRank algorithms; citation rank and PageRank are not significantlycorrelated with centrality measures; and h-index is not significantlycorrelated with centrality measures.
