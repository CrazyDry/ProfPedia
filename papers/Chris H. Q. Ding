An Iterative Locally Linear Embedding Algorithm

  Local Linear embedding (LLE) is a popular dimension reduction method. In thispaper, we first show LLE with nonnegative constraint is equivalent to thewidely used Laplacian embedding. We further propose to iterate the two steps inLLE repeatedly to improve the results. Thirdly, we relax the kNN constraint ofLLE and present a sparse similarity learning algorithm. The final Iterative LLEcombines these three improvements. Extensive experiment results show thatiterative LLE algorithm significantly improve both classification andclustering results.
