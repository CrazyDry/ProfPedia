Relational Learning and Feature Extraction by Querying over  Heterogeneous Information Networks

  Many real world systems need to operate on heterogeneous information networksthat consist of numerous interacting components of different types. Examplesinclude systems that perform data analysis on biological information networks;social networks; and information extraction systems processing unstructureddata to convert raw text to knowledge graphs. Many previous works describespecialized approaches to perform specific types of analysis, mining andlearning on such networks. In this work, we propose a unified frameworkconsisting of a data model -a graph with a first order schema along with adeclarative language for constructing, querying and manipulating such networksin ways that facilitate relational and structured machine learning. Inparticular, we provide an initial prototype for a relational and graphtraversal query language where queries are directly used as relational featuresfor structured machine learning models. Feature extraction is performed bymaking declarative graph traversal queries. Learning and inference models candirectly operate on this relational representation and augment it with new dataand knowledge that, in turn, is integrated seamlessly into the relationalstructure to support new predictions. We demonstrate this system's capabilitiesby showcasing tasks in natural language processing and computational biologydomains.

Deep Embedding for Spatial Role Labeling

  This paper introduces the visually informed embedding of word (VIEW), acontinuous vector representation for a word extracted from a deep neural modeltrained using the Microsoft COCO data set to forecast the spatial arrangementsbetween visual objects, given a textual description. The model is composed of adeep multilayer perceptron (MLP) stacked on the top of a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network, the latter being preceded by an embedding layer. The VIEW isapplied to transferring multimodal background knowledge to Spatial RoleLabeling (SpRL) algorithms, which recognize spatial relations between objectsmentioned in the text. This work also contributes with a new method to selectcomplementary features and a fine-tuning method for MLP that improves the $F1$measure in classifying the words into spatial roles. The VIEW is evaluated withthe Task 3 of SemEval-2013 benchmark data set, SpaceEval.
