Combining Answer Set Programming and POMDPs for Knowledge Representation  and Reasoning on Mobile Robots

  For widespread deployment in domains characterized by partial observability,non-deterministic actions and unforeseen changes, robots need to adapt sensing,processing and interaction with humans to the tasks at hand. While robotstypically cannot process all sensor inputs or operate without substantialdomain knowledge, it is a challenge to provide accurate domain knowledge andhumans may not have the time and expertise to provide elaborate and accuratefeedback. The architecture described in this paper combines declarativeprogramming and probabilistic reasoning to address these challenges, enablingrobots to: (a) represent and reason with incomplete domain knowledge, resolvingambiguities and revising existing knowledge using sensor inputs and minimalhuman feedback; and (b) probabilistically model the uncertainty in sensor inputprocessing and navigation. Specifically, Answer Set Programming (ASP), adeclarative programming paradigm, is combined with hierarchical partiallyobservable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), using domain knowledge to reviseprobabilistic beliefs, and using positive and negative observations for earlytermination of tasks that can no longer be pursued. All algorithms areevaluated in simulation and on mobile robots locating target objects in indoordomains.

KR$^3$: An Architecture for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in  Robotics

  This paper describes an architecture that combines the complementarystrengths of declarative programming and probabilistic graphical models toenable robots to represent, reason with, and learn from, qualitative andquantitative descriptions of uncertainty and knowledge. An action language isused for the low-level (LL) and high-level (HL) system descriptions in thearchitecture, and the definition of recorded histories in the HL is expanded toallow prioritized defaults. For any given goal, tentative plans created in theHL using default knowledge and commonsense reasoning are implemented in the LLusing probabilistic algorithms, with the corresponding observations used toupdate the HL history. Tight coupling between the two levels enables automaticselection of relevant variables and generation of suitable action policies inthe LL for each HL action, and supports reasoning with violation of defaults,noisy observations and unreliable actions in large and complex domains. Thearchitecture is evaluated in simulation and on physical robots transportingobjects in indoor domains; the benefit on robots is a reduction in taskexecution time of 39% compared with a purely probabilistic, but stillhierarchical, approach.

Evidence for mixed phases and percolation at the metal-insulator  transition in two dimensions

  The in-plane magnetoconductance of the strongly interacting two-dimensionalelectron system in a silicon MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effecttransistor) exhibits an unmistakeable kink at a well-defined electron density,$n_k$. The kink at $n_k$ is near, but not at the critical density $n_c$determined from resistivity measurements, and the density at which $n_k$ occursvaries with temperature. These features are inconsistent with expectations fora quantum phase transition. We suggest instead that this is a percolationtransition and present a detailed model based on the formation of a mixedinsulating and metallic phase within which a metal-insulator transition takesplace by percolation.

THUMT: An Open Source Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation

  This paper introduces THUMT, an open-source toolkit for neural machinetranslation (NMT) developed by the Natural Language Processing Group atTsinghua University. THUMT implements the standard attention-basedencoder-decoder framework on top of Theano and supports three trainingcriteria: maximum likelihood estimation, minimum risk training, andsemi-supervised training. It features a visualization tool for displaying therelevance between hidden states in neural networks and contextual words, whichhelps to analyze the internal workings of NMT. Experiments on Chinese-Englishdatasets show that THUMT using minimum risk training significantly outperformsGroundHog, a state-of-the-art toolkit for NMT.

Task Planning in Robotics: an Empirical Comparison of PDDL-based and  ASP-based Systems

  Robots need task planning algorithms to sequence actions toward accomplishinggoals that are impossible through individual actions. Off-the-shelf taskplanners can be used by intelligent robotics practitioners to solve a varietyof planning problems. However, many different planners exist, each withdifferent strengths and weaknesses, and there are no general rules for whichplanner would be best to apply to a given problem.  In this article, we empirically compare the performance of state-of-the-artplanners that use either the Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL), orAnswer Set Programming (ASP) as the underlying action language. PDDL isdesigned for task planning, and PDDL-based planners are widely used for avariety of planning problems. ASP is designed for knowledge-intensivereasoning, but can also be used for solving task planning problems. Givendomain encodings that are as similar as possible, we find that PDDL-basedplanners perform better on problems with longer solutions, and ASP-basedplanners are better on tasks with a large number of objects or in which complexreasoning is required to reason about action preconditions and effects. Theresulting analysis can inform selection among general purpose planning systemsfor particular robot task planning domains.

Invisible Steganography via Generative Adversarial Networks

  Nowadays, there are plenty of works introducing convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to the steganalysis and exceeding conventional steganalysis algorithms.These works have shown the improving potential of deep learning in informationhiding domain. There are also several works based on deep learning to do imagesteganography, but these works still have problems in capacity, invisibilityand security. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture named as\isgan to conceal a secret gray image into a color cover image on the senderside and exactly extract the secret image out on the receiver side. There arethree contributions in our work: (i) we improve the invisibility by hiding thesecret image only in the Y channel of the cover image; (ii) We introduce thegenerative adversarial networks to strengthen the security by minimizing thedivergence between the empirical probability distributions of stego images andnatural images. (iii) In order to associate with the human visual systembetter, we construct a mixed loss function which is more appropriate forsteganography to generate more realistic stego images and reveal out morebetter secret images. Experiment results show that ISGAN can achievestart-of-art performances on LFW, Pascal VOC2012 and ImageNet datasets.

Spatial-Temporal Residue Network Based In-Loop Filter for Video Coding

  Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous break through in the area ofimage/video processing. In this paper, a spatial-temporal residue network(STResNet) based in-loop filter is proposed to suppress visual artifacts suchas blocking, ringing in video coding. Specifically, the spatial and temporalinformation is jointly exploited by taking both current block and co-locatedblock in reference frame into consideration during the processing of in-loopfilter. The architecture of STResNet only consists of four convolution layerswhich shows hospitality to memory and coding complexity. Moreover, to fullyadapt the input content and improve the performance of the proposed in-loopfilter, coding tree unit (CTU) level control flag is applied in the sense ofrate-distortion optimization. Extensive experimental results show that ourscheme provides up to 5.1% bit-rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-artvideo coding standard.

Goal-oriented Dialogue Policy Learning from Failures

  Reinforcement learning methods have been used for learning dialogue policies.However, learning an effective dialogue policy frequently requiresprohibitively many conversations. This is partly because of the sparse rewardsin dialogues, and the very few successful dialogues in early learning phase.Hindsight experience replay (HER) enables learning from failures, but thevanilla HER is inapplicable to dialogue learning due to the implicit goals. Inthis work, we develop two complex HER methods providing different trade-offsbetween complexity and performance, and, for the first time, enabled HER-baseddialogue policy learning. Experiments using a realistic user simulator showthat our HER methods perform better than existing experience replay methods (asapplied to deep Q-networks) in learning rate.

Robot Representation and Reasoning with Knowledge from Reinforcement  Learning

  Reinforcement learning (RL) agents aim at learning by interacting with anenvironment, and are not designed for representing or reasoning withdeclarative knowledge. Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigmsare strong in declarative KRR tasks, but are ill-equipped to learn from suchexperiences. In this work, we integrate logical-probabilistic KRR withmodel-based RL, enabling agents to simultaneously reason with declarativeknowledge and learn from interaction experiences. The knowledge from humans andRL is unified and used for dynamically computing task-specific planning modelsunder potentially new environments. Experiments were conducted using a mobilerobot working on dialog, navigation, and delivery tasks. Results showsignificant improvements, in comparison to existing model-based RL methods.

Robot Sequential Decision Making using LSTM-based Learning and  Logical-probabilistic Reasoning

  Sequential decision-making (SDM) plays a key role in intelligent robotics,and can be realized in very different ways, such as supervised learning,automated reasoning, and probabilistic planning. The three families of methodsfollow different assumptions and have different (dis)advantages. In this work,we aim at a robot SDM framework that exploits the complementary features oflearning, reasoning, and planning. We utilize long short-term memory (LSTM),for passive state estimation with streaming sensor data, and commonsensereasoning and probabilistic planning (CORPP) for active information collectionand task accomplishment. In experiments, a mobile robot is tasked withestimating human intentions using their motion trajectories, declarativecontextual knowledge, and human-robot interaction (dialog-based andmotion-based). Results suggest that our framework performs better than itsno-learning and no-reasoning versions in a real-world office environment.

Scalable Facial Image Compression with Deep Feature Reconstruction

  In this paper, we propose a scalable image compression scheme, including thebase layer for feature representation and enhancement layer for texturerepresentation. More specifically, the base layer is designed as the deeplearning feature for analysis purpose, and it can also be converted to the finestructure with deep feature reconstruction. The enhancement layer, which servesto compress the residuals between the input image and the signals generatedfrom the base layer, aims to faithfully reconstruct the input texture. Theproposed scheme can feasibly inherit the advantages of bothcompress-then-analyze and analyze-then-compress schemes in surveillanceapplications. The performance of this framework is validated with facialimages, and the conducted experiments provide useful evidences to show that theproposed framework can achieve better rate-accuracy and rate-distortionperformance over conventional image compression schemes.

Globally Variance-Constrained Sparse Representation and Its Application  in Image Set Coding

  Sparse representation leads to an efficient way to approximately recover asignal by the linear composition of a few bases from a learnt dictionary, basedon which various successful applications have been achieved. However, in thescenario of data compression, its efficiency and popularity are hindered. It isbecause of the fact that encoding sparsely distributed coefficients may consumemore bits for representing the index of nonzero coefficients. Therefore,introducing an accurate rate-constraint in sparse coding and dictionarylearning becomes meaningful, which has not been fully exploited in the contextof sparse representation. According to the Shannon entropy inequality, thevariance of a Gaussian distributed data bounds its entropy, indicating theactual bitrate can be well estimated by its variance. Hence, a GloballyVariance-Constrained Sparse Representation (GVCSR) model is proposed in thiswork, where a variance-constrained rate term is introduced to the optimizationprocess. Specifically, we employ the Alternating Direction Method ofMultipliers (ADMM) to solve the non-convex optimization problem for sparsecoding and dictionary learning, both of them have shown the state-of-the-artrate-distortion performance for image representation. Furthermore, weinvestigate the potential of applying the GVCSR algorithm in the practicalimage set compression, where the optimized dictionary is trained to efficientlyrepresent the images captured in similar scenarios by implicitly utilizinginter-image correlations. Experimental results have demonstrated superiorrate-distortion performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

Fast MPEG-CDVS Encoder with GPU-CPU Hybrid Computing

  The compact descriptors for visual search (CDVS) standard from ISO/IEC movingpictures experts group (MPEG) has succeeded in enabling the interoperabilityfor efficient and effective image retrieval by standardizing the bitstreamsyntax of compact feature descriptors. However, the intensive computation ofCDVS encoder unfortunately hinders its widely deployment in industry forlarge-scale visual search. In this paper, we revisit the merits of lowcomplexity design of CDVS core techniques and present a very fast CDVS encoderby leveraging the massive parallel execution resources of GPU. We elegantlyshift the computation-intensive and parallel-friendly modules to thestate-of-the-arts GPU platforms, in which the thread block allocation and thememory access are jointly optimized to eliminate performance loss. In addition,those operations with heavy data dependence are allocated to CPU to resolve theextra but non-necessary computation burden for GPU. Furthermore, we havedemonstrated the proposed fast CDVS encoder can work well with thoseconvolution neural network approaches which has harmoniously leveraged theadvantages of GPU platforms, and yielded significant performance improvements.Comprehensive experimental results over benchmarks are evaluated, which hasshown that the fast CDVS encoder using GPU-CPU hybrid computing is promisingfor scalable visual search.

REBA: A Refinement-Based Architecture for Knowledge Representation and  Reasoning in Robotics

  This paper describes an architecture for robots that combines thecomplementary strengths of probabilistic graphical models and declarativeprogramming to represent and reason with logic-based and probabilisticdescriptions of uncertainty and domain knowledge. An action language isextended to support non-boolean fluents and non-deterministic causal laws. Thisaction language is used to describe tightly-coupled transition diagrams at twolevels of granularity, with a fine-resolution transition diagram defined as arefinement of a coarse-resolution transition diagram of the domain. Thecoarse-resolution system description, and a history that includes (prioritized)defaults, are translated into an Answer Set Prolog (ASP) program. For any givengoal, inference in the ASP program provides a plan of abstract actions. Toimplement each such abstract action, the robot automatically zooms to the partof the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to this action. Aprobabilistic representation of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation isthen included in this zoomed fine-resolution system description, and used toconstruct a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The policyobtained by solving the POMDP is invoked repeatedly to implement the abstractaction as a sequence of concrete actions, with the corresponding observationsbeing recorded in the coarse-resolution history and used for subsequentreasoning. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robotmoving objects in an indoor domain, to show that it supports reasoning withviolation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions, in complexdomains.

Integrating Task-Motion Planning with Reinforcement Learning for Robust  Decision Making in Mobile Robots

  Task-motion planning (TMP) addresses the problem of efficiently generatingexecutable and low-cost task plans in a discrete space such that the (initiallyunknown) action costs are determined by motion plans in a correspondingcontinuous space. However, a task-motion plan can be sensitive to unexpecteddomain uncertainty and changes, leading to suboptimal behaviors or executionfailures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TMP-RL, which is anintegration of TMP and reinforcement learning (RL) from the executionexperience, to solve the problem of robust task-motion planning in dynamic anduncertain domains. TMP-RL features two nested planning-learning loops. In theinner TMP loop, the robot generates a low-cost, feasible task-motion plan byiteratively planning in the discrete space and updating relevant action costsevaluated by the motion planner in continuous space. In the outer loop, theplan is executed, and the robot learns from the execution experience viamodel-free RL, to further improve its task-motion plans. RL in the outer loopis more accurate to the current domain but also more expensive, and using lesscostly task and motion planning leads to a jump-start for learning in the realworld. Our approach is evaluated on a mobile service robot conductingnavigation tasks in an office area. Results show that TMP-RL approachsignificantly improves adaptability and robustness (in comparison to TMPmethods) and leads to rapid convergence (in comparison to task planning (TP)-RLmethods). We also show that TMP-RL can reuse learned values to smoothly adaptto new scenarios during long-term deployments.

Image and Video Compression with Neural Networks: A Review

  In recent years, the image and video coding technologies have advanced byleaps and bounds. However, due to the popularization of image and videoacquisition devices, the growth rate of image and video data is far beyond theimprovement of the compression ratio. In particular, it has been widelyrecognized that there are increasing challenges of pursuing further codingperformance improvement within the traditional hybrid coding framework. Deepconvolution neural network (CNN) which makes the neural network resurge inrecent years and has achieved great success in both artificial intelligent andsignal processing fields, also provides a novel and promising solution forimage and video compression. In this paper, we provide a systematic,comprehensive and up-to-date review of neural network based image and videocompression techniques. The evolution and development of neural network basedcompression methodologies are introduced for images and video respectively.More specifically, the cutting-edge video coding techniques by leveraging deeplearning and HEVC framework are presented and discussed, which promote thestate-of-the-art video coding performance substantially. Moreover, theend-to-end image and video coding frameworks based on neural networks are alsoreviewed, revealing interesting explorations on next generation image and videocoding frameworks/standards. The most significant research works on the imageand video coding related topics using neural networks are highlighted, andfuture trends are also envisioned. In particular, the joint compression onsemantic and visual information is tentatively explored to formulate highefficiency signal representation structure for both human vision and machinevision, which are the two dominant signal receptor in the age of artificialintelligence.
