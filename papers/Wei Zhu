Parton recombination effect in polarized parton distributions

  Parton recombination corrections to the standard spin-dependentAltarelli-Parisi evolution equation are considered in a nonlinear evolutionequation. The properties of this recombination equation and its relation withthe spin-averaged form are discussed.

An Energy Reducing Flow for Multiple-Valued Functions

  By the method of discrete Morse flows, we construct an energy reducingmultiple-valued function flow. The flow we get is Holder continuous withrespect to the L-2 norm. We also give another way of constructing flows in somespecial cases, where the flow we get behaves like ordinary heat flow.

A Theorem on Frequency Function for Multiple-Valued Dirichlet Minimizing  Functions

  This paper discusses the frequency function of multiple-valued Dirichletminimizing functions in the special case when the domain and range are both twodimensional. It shows that the frequency function must be of value k/2 for somenonnegative integer k. Futhermore, by looking at the blowing-up functions, wecharacterize the local behavior of the original Dirichlet minimizing function.

Are valence quarks rotating?

  We suggest to compare the deep inelastic scattering structure functionsmeasured in the unpolarized charged-lepton scattering off a transverselypolarized proton and off a longitudinally polarized proton at larger Bjorkenvariable $x$, one may get a direct evidence concerning the valence quarkorbital angular momentum in the proton. This possible rotating effect isestimated by using a proton-ensemble model.

Improved Bethe-Heitler formula

  The bremsstrahlung cross section of electron in the atomic electric field isre-derived using the time ordered perturbative theory. The results are comparedwith the Bethe-Heitler formula. We indicate that both the TOPT-description anda soft version for the bremsstrahlung process predict a strong screeningparameter-dependent cross section, which is missed by previous bremsstrahlungtheory.

Spin 3/2 Pentaquarks

  We investigate the possible existence of the spin 3/2 pentaquark states usinginterpolating currents with K-N color-octet structure in the framework of QCDfinite energy sum rule (FESR). We pay special attention to the convergence ofthe operator product expansion.

Rational vertex operator algebras are finitely generated

  It is proved that any vertex operator algebra for which the image of theVirasoro element in Zhu's algebra is algebraic over complex numbers is finitelygenerated. In particular, any vertex operator algebra with a finite dimensionalZhu's algebra is finitely generated. As a result, any rational vertex operatoralgebra is finitely generated.

Hurwitz-Hodge integral identities from the cut-and-join equation

  In this paper, we present some Hurwitz-Hodge integral identities which arederived from the Laplace transform of the cut-and-join equation for theorbifold Hurwitz numbers. As an application, we prove a conjecture onHurwitz-Hodge integral proposed by J. Zhou in 2008.

A new modified Altarelli-Parisi evolution equation with parton  recombination in proton

  The coefficients of the nonlinear terms in a modified Altarelli-Parisievolution equation with parton recombination are determined in the leadinglogarithmic ($Q^2$) approximation. The results are valid in the whole $x$region and contain the translation $GG\to q\bar q$, which is inhibited in thedouble leading logarithmic approximation. The comparisons of the new evolutionequation with the Gribov-Levin-Ryskin equation are presented.

Contributions of gluon recombination to saturation phenomena

  Parton distributions in the small $x$ region are numerically predicted byusing a modified DGLAP equation with the GRV-like input distributions. We findthat gluon recombination at twist-4 level obviously suppresses the rapid growthof parton densities with $x$ decrease. We show that before the saturation scale$Q^2_s$ is reached, saturation and partial saturation appear in the small $x$behavior of parton distributions in nucleus and free proton, respectively. Theantishadowing contributions to the saturation phenomena are also discussed.

A unity of QCD evolution dynamics at small $x$ region

  The DGLAP, BFKL, modified DGLAP and modified BFKL equations are constructedin a unified partonic framework. The antishadowing effect in the recombinationprocess is emphasized, which leads to two different small $x$ behaviors ofgluon distribution. In the meantime, the BFKL equation and modified DGLAPequation are viewed as the corrections of the initial gluon correlations to theevolution dynamics at twist-2 and twist-4, respectively. A partonic explanationof Regge theory for the BFKL dynamics and the relation of the BFKL dynamicswith the helicity configuration of the initial gluons are presented.

A geometrizing higher twist effect on nuclear target

  The higher twist effects in deep inelastic scattering on the nuclear targetare studied using time ordered perturbation theory. We showed that thecollinear rescattering of the outgoing quark on the extra nucleons via thecontacting gluon-pair is dominant in nuclear size-dependent effects. TheQiu-Vitev resummation is proved by using the geometric properties of the highertwist amplitudes. The leading contributions of nuclear-enhanced effect to theDGLAP evolution equation are resummed in the same framework.

Strong decays of $D_{sJ}(2317)$ and $D_{sJ}(2460)$

  With the identification of ($D_{sJ}(2317), D_{sJ}(2460)$) as the ($0^+$,$1^+$) doublet in the heavy quark effective field theory, we derive the lightcone QCD sum rule for the coupling of eta meson with $D_{sJ}(2317) D_s $ and$D_{sJ}(2460) D_s^{*} $. Through $\eta-\pi^0$ mixing we calculate their pionicdecay widths, which are consistent with the experimental values (or upperlimits). Combining the radiative decay widths derived by Colangelo, Fazio andOzpineci in the same framework, we conclude that the decay patterns of$D_{sJ}(2317, 2460)$ strongly support their interpretation as ordinary $c \bars$ mesons.

Antishadowing effects in the unitarized BFKL equation

  A unitarized BFKL equation incorporating shadowing and antishadowingcorrections of the gluon recombination is proposed. This equation reduces tothe Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation near the saturation limit. We findthat the antishadowing effects have a sizeable influence on the gluondistribution function in the preasymptotic regime.

A new perspective on gluon distribution at small x

  The corrections of the gluon fusion to the BFKL equation in a unifiedpartonic framework are studied. This modified BFKL equation predicts a strongershadowing, which suppresses the gluon density and even leads to the gluondisappearance below the saturation region. We suggest that this unexpectedeffect is caused by a possible chaotic solution of the new equation.

A regularity theory for multiple-valued Dirichlet minimizing maps

  This paper discusses the regularity of multiple-valued Dirichlet minimizingmaps into the sphere. It shows that even at branched point, as long as thenormalized energy is small enough, we have the energy decay estimate. Combinedwith the previous work by Chun-Chi Lin, we get our first estimate that m-2dimensional Hausdorff measure of singular set is zero. Furthermore, by lookingat the tangent map and using dimension reduction argument, we show that thesingular set is at least of codimension 3.

Nuclear Shadowing and Antishadowing in a Unitarized BFKL Equation

  The nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects are explained by a unitarizedBFKL equation. The $Q^2$- and $x$-variations of the nuclear partondistributions are detailed based on the level of the unintegrated gluondistribution. In particular, the asymptotical behavior of the unintegratedgluon distribution near the saturation limit in nuclear targets is studied. Ourresults in the nuclear targets are insensitive to the input distributions ifthe parameters are fixed by the data of a free proton.

Can a chaos term in the QCD evolution equation restrain high-energy  collider physics?

  We indicate that the random aperiodic oscillation of the gluon distributionsin a modified BFKL equation has the positive Lyapunov exponents. This firstexample of chaos in QCD evolution equations, raises the sudden disappearance ofthe gluon distributions at a critical small value of the Bjorken variable $x$and may stop the increase of the new particle events in a ultra high energyhadron collider.

Can a chaotic solution in the QCD evolution equation restrain  high-energy collider physics?

  We indicate that the random aperiodic oscillation of the gluon distributionsin a modified Balisky--Fadin--Kuraev--Lipatov (BFKL) equation has positiveLyapunov exponents. This first example of chaos in QCD evolution equations,raises the sudden disappearance of the gluon distributions at a critical smallvalue of the Bjorken variable $x$ and may stop the increase of the new particleevents in an ultra high energy hadron collider.

Prediction for unintegrated parton distributions

  Unintegrated parton distributions in the proton and nucleus are predicted bya modified DGLAP equation incorporating the shadowing corrections, whichinclude exact energy-momentum conservation in each splitting and fusionvertices. We find that the nuclear shadowing effects are obvious, although theyare far from the saturation limit. On the other hand, we point out that thesuppression of the unintegrated gluon distribution toward lower $k_t^2$ mayarise from the valence-like input rather than the saturation effects.

Particle multiplicities at LHC and deviations from limiting  fragmentation

  The pseudorapidity density of charged particles produced at LHC collisionsare predicted by using two complementary production mechanisms with a set ofconsistent integrated and unintegrated parton distributions. We discuss thelimiting fragmentation hypothesis and its possible violation, and we compareour model with other partonic models.

Evidence of Different Formation Mechanisms for Hot versus Warm  Super-Earths

  Using the Kepler planet sample from Buchhave et al. and the statisticalmethod clarified by Schlaufman, I show that the shorter-period super-Earthshave a different dependence on the host star metallicity from the longer-periodsuper-Earths, with the transition period being in the period range from 70 to100 days. The hosts of shorter-period super-Earths are on average moremetal-rich than those of longer-period super-Earths. The existence of such atransition period cannot be explained by any single theory of super-Earthformation, suggesting that super-Earths have formed via at least twomechanisms.

Nucleon spin structure III: Origins of the generalized  Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule

  The generalized Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule is understood based onthe polarized parton distributions of the proton with the higher twistcontributions. A simple parameterized formula is proposed to clearly presentthe contributions of different components in proton to $\Gamma_1^p(Q^2)$. Wefind that the contribution of quark helicity to $\Gamma_1^p(Q^2)$ is almostconstant ($\sim 0.123$); the twist-4 effect dominates the suppression of$\Gamma_1^p(Q^2)$ at $Q^2<3GeV^2$, while the twist-6 effect arises a dramaticchange of $\Gamma_1^p(Q^2)$ at $Q^2<0.3 GeV^2$, it implies a possible extendedobjects with size $0.2-0.3~ fm$ inside the proton.

Sudden transition from naked atom decay to dressed atom decay

  The studies on quantum open system play key roles not only in fundamentalproblems in quantum mechanics but also in quantum computing and informationprocesses. Here we propose a scheme to use a one dimensional coupling cavityarray (CCA) as an artificial electromagnetic environment of a two-level atom.For a finite length of CCA, we find that after a turning time the population ofexcited state deviates suddenly from the exponential decay. We show thatphysically this phenomena corresponds to a transition from a naked atom decayto a dressed state decay. We hope that our finding will promote the studies onquantum system with a finite size environment.

Looking for the gluon condensation signature in proton using the Earth  limb gamma-ray spectra

  A new type of gamma ray spectrum is predicted in a general hadronic frameworkif considering the gluon condensation effects in proton. The result presentsthe power-law with a sharp break in the gamma ray spectra at the TeV-band. Wesuggest to probe this GC-signature in the Earth limb gamma-ray spectra usingthe DArk Matter Particle Explorer and the CALorimetric Electron Telescope onorbit.

Projective and injective objects in symmetric categorical groups

  We prove that the 2-category of symmetric categorical groups have enoughprojective and injective objects. This was conjectured by Bourn and Vitale in2002 and was anounced recently by Fang Huang, Shao-Han Chen, Wei Chen andZhu-Jun Zheng in arXiv:1006.4677 with wrong proof.

Cryptanalysis and Improvement of Jiang et al.'s Smart Card Based Remote  User Authentication Scheme

  The smart card based authentication protocols try to ensure secure andauthorized communication between remote entities. In 2012, Wei et al. presentedan improvement of Wu et al.'s two-factor authentication scheme for TMIS whichis proven vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack by Zhu. Zhu alsoproposed a modified scheme to overcome with weakness of Wei et al.'s scheme,although Lee and Liu showed the failure of his scheme to resist parallelsession attacks. Moreover, Lee and Liu introduced an improved scheme. Weanalyze Wei et al.'s, Zhu's and Lee and Liu's schemes and identify that none ofthe schemes resist on-line password guessing attack. Moreover, these schemes donot present efficient login and password chance phase. We also show that howinefficient password change phase causes denial of service attack. Further, wepropose an improved password based remote user authentication scheme with theaim to eliminate all the drawbacks of previously presented schemes.

Could Interaction with Social Robots Facilitate Joint Attention of  Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder?

  This research addressed whether interactions with social robots couldfacilitate joint attention of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twoconditions of initiators, namely 'Human' vs. 'Robot' were measured with 15children with ASD and 15 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Apartfrom fixation and gaze transition, a new longest common subsequence (LCS)approach was proposed to analyze eye-movement traces. Results revealed thatchildren with ASD showed deficits of joint attention. Compared to the humanagent, robot facilitate less fixations towards the targets, but it attractedmore attention and allowed the children to show gaze transition and to followjoint attention logic. This results highlight both potential application of LCSanalysis on eye-tracking studies and of social robot to intervention.

The Possible $J^{PC}I^G=2^{++}2^+$ State X(1600)

  The interesting state X(1600) with $J^{PC}I^G=2^{++}2^+$ can't be aconventional $q \bar q$ meson in the quark model. Using a mixed interpolatingcurrent with different color configurations, we investigate the possibleexistence of X(1600) in the framework of QCD finite energy sum rules. Ourresults indicate that both the "hidden color" and coupled channel effects maybe quite important in the multiquark system. We propose several reactions tolook for this state.

Unparticle Physics and A_{FB}^b on the Z pole

  An attempt has been made to address the 3\sigma anomaly of theforward-backward asymmetry of b quark in LEP data via an unparticle sector. Formost part of the parameter space except certain particular regions, the anomalycould not be explained away plausibly, when constraints from other LEPobservables are taken into account.

Chemical Doping and Enhanced Solar Energy Conversion of Graphene/Silicon  Junctions

  The effect of chemical doping of graphene films on the photovoltaicproperties of the graphene/silicon Schottky junction solar cells wasinvestigated. Thionyl chloride modification greatly enhanced the conductivityof graphene film, resulting in a significant improvement in cell performancewith a 3-fold increase in conversion efficiency (up to 3.9%) and goodshort-term stability.

XYZ States

  In the past decade, many new charmonium (or charmonium-like) and bottomonium(or bottomonium-like) states were observed experimentally. I will review theseXYZ states which do not fit into the quark model spectrum easily.

General Monogamy Relation between Information-Theoretic Contextuality  Inequalities

  We show that the perfect commutation graph is the sufficient tight conditionfor admitting the noncontextual description of each observable set satisfyingit in the yes-no question scenario. With this condition, we propose a methodfor proving the monogamy relation between two informationtheoreticcontextuality inequalities by decomposing the total commutation graph intoperfect subgraphs. The results offer a powerful tool to investigate thecontextuality and to understand quantum information theory. This theoreticalwork can be experimentally verified in current laboratorial technology.

Social contagions on weighted networks

  We investigate critical behaviors of a social contagion model on weightednetworks. An edge-weight compartmental approach is applied to analyze theweighted social contagion on strongly heterogenous networks with skewed degreeand weight distributions. We find that degree heterogeneity can not only alterthe nature of contagion transition from discontinuous to continuous but alsocan enhance or hamper the size of adoption, depending on the unit transmissionprobability. We also show that, the heterogeneity of weight distribution alwayshinder social contagions, and does not alter the transition type.

Experimental Device-Independent Tests of Classical and Quantum Entropy

  In this paper, we report an experiment about the device-independent tests ofclassical and quantum entropy based on a recent proposal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,110501 (2015)], in which the states are encoded on the polarization of abiphoton system and measured by the state tomography technology. We alsotheoretically obtained the minimal quantum entropy for three widely used lineardimension witnesses. The experimental results agree well with the theoreticalanalysis, demonstrating that lower entropy is needed in quantum systems thanthat in classical systems under given values of the dimension witness.

Occurrence of synchronized flow due to overtaking strategy in the  Nagel-Schreckenberg model

  The Nagel-Schreckenberg model with overtaking strategy (NSOS) is proposed,and numerical simulations are performed for both closed and open boundaryconditions. The fundamental diagram, space-time diagram, and spatial-temporaldistribution of speed are investigated. In order to identify the synchronizedflow state, both the correlation functions (autocorrelation andcross-correlation) and the one-minute average flow rate vs. density diagram arestudied. All the results verify that synchronized flow does occur in our model.

Matching Using Sufficient Dimension Reduction for Causal Inference

  To estimate casual treatment effects, we propose a new matching approachbased on the reduced covariates obtained from sufficient dimension reduction.Compared to the original covariates and the propensity score, which arecommonly used for matching in the literature, the reduced covariates areestimable nonparametrically under a mild assumption on the original covariates,and are sufficient and effective in imputing the missing potential outcomes.Under the ignorability assumption, the consistency of the proposed approachrequires a weaker common support condition. In addition, the researchers areallowed to use different reduced covariates to find matched subjects fordifferent treatment groups. We develop relative asymptotic results, and conductsimulation studies as well as real data analysis to illustrate the usefulnessof the proposed approach.

Retrieval-Enhanced Adversarial Training for Neural Response Generation

  Dialogue systems are usually built on either generation-based orretrieval-based approaches, yet they do not benefit from the advantages ofdifferent models. In this paper, we propose a Retrieval-Enhanced AdversarialTraining (REAT) method for neural response generation. Distinct from existingap- proaches, the REAT method leverages an encoder-decoder framework in termsof an adversarial training paradigm, while taking advantage of N-best responsecandidates from a retrieval-based system to construct the discriminator. Anempirical study on a large scale public available benchmark dataset shows thatthe REAT method significantly outper- forms the vanilla Seq2Seq model as wellas the conventional adversarial training approach.

Optical Flow Based Online Moving Foreground Analysis

  Obtained by moving object detection, the foreground mask result is unshapedand can not be directly used in most subsequent processes. In this paper, wefocus on this problem and address it by constructing an optical flow basedmoving foreground analysis framework. During the processing procedure, theforeground masks are analyzed and segmented through two complementaryclustering algorithms. As a result, we obtain the instance-level informationlike the number, location and size of moving objects. The experimental resultshow that our method adapts itself to the problem and performs well enough forpractical applications.

Motion Control on Bionic Eyes: A Comprehensive Review

  Biology can provide biomimetic components and new control principles forrobotics. Developing a robot system equipped with bionic eyes is a difficultbut exciting task. Researchers have been studying the control mechanisms ofbionic eyes for many years and considerable models are available. In thispaper, control model and its implementation on robots for bionic eyes arereviewed, which covers saccade, smooth pursuit, vergence, vestibule-ocularreflex (VOR), optokinetic reflex (OKR) and eye-head coordination. What is more,some problems and possible solutions in the field of bionic eyes are discussedand analyzed. This review paper can be used as a guide for researchers toidentify potential research problems and solutions of the bionic eyes' motioncontrol.

Possible $J^{PC} = 0^{--}$ Charmonium-like State

  We study the possible charmonium-like states with $J^{PC}=0^{--}, 0^{-+}$using the tetraquark interpolating currents with the QCD sum rules approach.The extracted masses are around 4.5 GeV for the $0^{--}$ charmonium-like statesand 4.6 GeV for the $0^{-+}$ charmonium-like states while theirbottomonium-like analogues lie around 10.6 GeV. We also discuss the possibledecay, production and the experiment search of the $0^{--}$ charmonium-likestate.

All-Optical Control of Light Group Velocity with a Cavity Optomechanical  System

  We theoretically demonstrate complete all-optical control of light groupvelocity via a cavity optomechanical system composed of an optical cavity and amechanical resonator. The realization depends on no specific materials insidethe cavity, and the control of light group velocity stems from the interactionbetween the signal light and the moving optical diffraction grating within thecavity in analogy to the stimulated Brillouin scattering(SBS). Furthermore, weshow that a tunable switch from slow light to fast light can be achieved onlyby simply adjusting the pump-cavity detuning. The scheme proposed here willopen a novel way to control light velocity by all-optical methods inoptomechanical systems.

Strong solutions for SPDE with locally monotone coefficients driven by  Lévy noise

  Motivated by applications to a manifold of semilinear and quasilinearstochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) we establish the existenceand uniqueness of strong solutions to coercive and locally monotone SPDEsdriven by L\'{e}vy processes. We illustrate the main result of our paper byshowing how it can be applied to various types of SPDEs such as stochasticreaction-diffusion equations, stochastic Burgers type equations, stochastic 2Dhydrodynamical systems and stochastic equations of non-Newtonian fluids, whichgeneralize many existing results in the literature.

Possible $J^{PC} = 0^{+-}$ Exotic State

  We study the possible exotic states with $J^{PC} = 0^{+-}$ using thetetraquark interpolating currents with the QCD sum rule approach. The extractedmasses are around 4.85 GeV for the charmonium-like states and 11.25 GeV for thebottomomium-like states. There is no working region for the light tetraquarkcurrents, which implies the light $0^{+-}$ state may not exist below 2 GeV.

Large deviation principles for the stochastic quasi-geostrophic equation

  In this paper we establish the large deviation principle for the stochasticquasi-geostrophic equation in the subcritical case with small multiplicativenoise. The proof is mainly based on the stochastic control and weak convergenceapproach. Some analogous results are also obtained for the small timeasymptotics of the stochastic quasi-geostrophic equation.

Optimal Ternary Constant-Composition Codes with Weight Four and Distance  Six

  The sizes of optimal constant-composition codes of weight three have beendetermined by Chee, Ge and Ling with four cases in doubt. Group divisible codesplayed an important role in their constructions. In this paper, we study theproblem of constructing optimal ternary constant-composition codes with Hammingweight four and minimum distance six. The problem is solved with a small numberof lengths undetermined. The previously known results are those with codelength no greater than 10.

Optimal Conventional Measurements for Quantum-Enhanced Interferometry

  A major obstacle to attain the fundamental precision limit of the phaseestimation in an interferometry is the identification and implementation of theoptimal measurement. Here we demonstrate that this can be accomplished by theuse of three conventional measurements among interferometers with Bayesianestimation techniques. Conditions that hold for the precision limit to beattained with these measurements are obtained by explicitly calculating theFisher information. Remarkably, these conditions are naturally satisfied inmost interferometric experiments. We apply our results to an experiment ofatomic spectroscopy and examine robustness of phase sensitivity for thetwo-axis counter-twisted state suffering from detection noise.

Implementations of two-photon four-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates  assisted by nitrogen-vacancy centers

  It is desirable to implement an efficient quantum information processdemanding fewer quantum resources. We designed two compact quantum circuits fordeterminately implementing four-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates onsingle-photon systems in both the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom(DoFs) via diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in resonators. The gates areheralded by the electron spins associated with the diamond NV centers. Incontrast to the ones with one DoF, our implementations reduce the quantumresource and are robust against the decoherence. Evaluations of fidelities andefficiencies of our gates show that our schemes may be implemented with currenttechnology.

Weighted estimates for the multilinear maximal function on the upper  half-spaces

  For a general dyadic grid, we give a Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund type decomposition,which is the principle fact about the multilinear maximal function$\mathfrak{M}$ on the upper half-spaces. Using the decomposition, we study theboundedness of $\mathfrak{M}.$ We obtain a natural extension to the multilinearsetting of Muckenhoupt's weak-type characterization. We also partially obtaincharacterizations of Muckenhoupt's strong-type inequalities with one weight.Assuming the reverse H\"{o}lder's condition, we get a multilinear analogue ofSawyer's two weight theorem. Moreover, we also get Hyt\"{o}nen-P\'{e}rez typeweighted estimates.
