The prospects for mathematical logic in the twenty-first century

  The four authors present their speculations about the future developments ofmathematical logic in the twenty-first century. The areas of recursion theory,proof theory and logic for computer science, model theory, and set theory arediscussed independently.

Small Stone in Pool

  The Stone tautologies are known to have polynomial size resolutionrefutations and require exponential size regular refutations. We prove that theStone tautologies also have polynomial size proofs in both pool resolution andthe proof system of regular tree-like resolution with input lemmas (regRTI).Therefore, the Stone tautologies do not separate resolution from DPLL withclause learning.

Resolution Trees with Lemmas: Resolution Refinements that Characterize  DLL Algorithms with Clause Learning

  Resolution refinements called w-resolution trees with lemmas (WRTL) and withinput lemmas (WRTI) are introduced. Dag-like resolution is equivalent to bothWRTL and WRTI when there is no regularity condition. For regular proofs, anexponential separation between regular dag-like resolution and both regularWRTL and regular WRTI is given.  It is proved that DLL proof search algorithms that use clause learning basedon unit propagation can be polynomially simulated by regular WRTI. Moregenerally, non-greedy DLL algorithms with learning by unit propagation areequivalent to regular WRTI. A general form of clause learning, calledDLL-Learn, is defined that is equivalent to regular WRTL.  A variable extension method is used to give simulations of resolution byregular WRTI, using a simplified form of proof trace extensions. DLL-Learn andnon-greedy DLL algorithms with learning by unit propagation can use variableextensions to simulate general resolution without doing restarts.  Finally, an exponential lower bound for WRTL where the lemmas are restrictedto short clauses is shown.
