Shocking the Crowd: The Effect of Censorship Shocks on Chinese Wikipedia

  Collaborative crowdsourcing has become a popular approach to organizing workacross the globe. Being global also means being vulnerable to shocks --unforeseen events that disrupt crowds -- that originate from any country. Inthis study, we examine changes in collaborative behavior of editors of ChineseWikipedia that arise due to the 2005 government censor- ship in mainland China.Using the exogenous variation in the fraction of editors blocked acrossdifferent articles due to the censorship, we examine the impact of reduction ingroup size, which we denote as the shock level, on three collaborative behaviormeasures: volume of activity, centralization, and conflict. We find thatactivity and conflict drop on articles that face a shock, whereascentralization increases. The impact of a shock on activity increases withshock level, whereas the impact on centralization and conflict is higher formoderate shock levels than for very small or very high shock levels. Thesefindings provide support for threat rigidity theory -- originally introduced inthe organizational theory literature -- in the context of large-scalecollaborative crowds.
