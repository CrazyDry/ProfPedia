Tally NP Sets and Easy Census Functions

  We study the question of whether every P set has an easy (i.e.,polynomial-time computable) census function. We characterize this question interms of unlikely collapses of language and function classes such as thecontainment of #P_1 in FP, where #P_1 is the class of functions that count thewitnesses for tally NP sets. We prove that every #P_{1}^{PH} function can becomputed in FP^{#P_{1}^{#P_{1}}}. Consequently, every P set has an easy censusfunction if and only if every set in the polynomial hierarchy does. We showthat the assumption of #P_1 being contained in FP implies P = BPP and that PHis contained in MOD_{k}P for each k \geq 2, which provides further evidencethat not all sets in P have an easy census function. We also relate a set'sproperty of having an easy census function to other well-studied properties ofsets, such as rankability and scalability (the closure of the rankable setsunder P-isomorphisms). Finally, we prove that it is no more likely that thecensus function of any set in P can be approximated (more precisely, can ben^{\alpha}-enumerated in time n^{\beta} for fixed \alpha and \beta) than thatit can be precisely computed in polynomial time.

Maximal Matching and Path Matching Counting in Polynomial Time for  Graphs of Bounded Clique Width

  In this paper, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for different extensionsof the matching counting problem, namely maximal matchings, path matchings(linear forest) and paths, on graph classes of bounded clique-width. Formaximal matchings, we introduce matching-cover pairs to efficiently handlemaximality in the local structure, and develop a polynomial time algorithm. Forpath matchings, we develop a way to classify the path matchings in a polynomialnumber of equivalent classes. Using these, we develop dynamic programingalgorithms that run in polynomial time of the graph size, but in exponentialtime of the clique-width. In particular, we show that for a graph $G$ of $n$vertices and clique-width $k$, these problems can be solved in $O(n^{f(k)})$time where $f$ is exponential in $k$ or in $O(n^g(l))$ time where $g$ is linearor quadratic in $l$ if an $l$-expression for $G$ is given as input.

Multimodal Content Analysis for Effective Advertisements on YouTube

  The rapid advances in e-commerce and Web 2.0 technologies have greatlyincreased the impact of commercial advertisements on the general public. As akey enabling technology, a multitude of recommender systems exists whichanalyzes user features and browsing patterns to recommend appealingadvertisements to users. In this work, we seek to study the characteristics orattributes that characterize an effective advertisement and recommend a usefulset of features to aid the designing and production processes of commercialadvertisements. We analyze the temporal patterns from multimedia content ofadvertisement videos including auditory, visual and textual components, andstudy their individual roles and synergies in the success of an advertisement.The objective of this work is then to measure the effectiveness of anadvertisement, and to recommend a useful set of features to advertisementdesigners to make it more successful and approachable to users. Our proposedframework employs the signal processing technique of cross modality featurelearning where data streams from different components are employed to trainseparate neural network models and are then fused together to learn a sharedrepresentation. Subsequently, a neural network model trained on this jointfeature embedding representation is utilized as a classifier to predictadvertisement effectiveness. We validate our approach using subjective ratingsfrom a dedicated user study, the sentiment strength of online viewer comments,and a viewer opinion metric of the ratio of the Likes and Views received byeach advertisement from an online platform.
