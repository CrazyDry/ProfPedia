MAEC : A Movement-Assisted Energy Conserving Method in Event Driven  Wireless Sensor Networks

  Energy is one of the most important resources in wireless sensor networks.Recently, the mobility of base station has been exploited to preserve theenergy. But in event driven networks, the mobility issue is quite differentfrom the continuous monitoring one because only a small portion of sensor nodehas data to send at one time. The number of sensor node that forward trafficshould be minimized to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, we proposea movement-assisted energy conserving method which tries to reduce the amountof forwarding sensor node by directing the base station to move close to thehotspots. This method achieves good performance especially when applied to anetwork with a set of cooperative mobile base station. Extensive simulation hasbeen done to verify the effectiveness of the propose schema.

A unified crowd simulation model revealing relationships among  "Physiology-Psychology-Physics" factors

  We present a unified model for crowd simulation, CubeP, which comprehensivelyconsiders physiological, psychological, and physical factors. Inspired by thetheory of "the devoted actor," the movements of each individual in our modelare determined by modeling the physical influence of physical strengthconsumption and the emotion of panic. In particular, human physical strengthconsumption is computed using a physics-based numerical method. Inspired by theJames-Lange theory, panic emotion is estimated by means of an enhancedemotional contagion model that leverages the inherent relation between physicalstrength consumption and panic emotion. To the best of our knowledge, our modelis the first method that integrates physiological, psychological, and physicalfactors together and exploits the relationship between these factors. Wehighlight the performance on different scenarios and compare the resultingbehavior with real-world video sequences. Our approach can reliably predict thechanges in physical strength consumption and panic emotion of individuals in anemergency situation.

Crowd Behavior Simulation with Emotional Contagion in Unexpected  Multi-hazard Situations

  In this paper we present a novel crowd simulation method by modeling thegeneration and contagion of panic emotion under multi-hazard circumstances.Specifically, we first classify hazards into different types (transient andpersistent, concurrent and non-concurrent, static and dynamic ) based on theirinherent characteristics. Then, we introduce the concept of perilous field foreach hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to itsinvoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model tosimulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards inthese situations. Finally, we introduce an Emotional Reciprocal VelocityObstacles (ERVO) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting thetraditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which combines the emotionalimpact and local avoidance together for the first time. Our experimentalresults show that this method can soundly generate realistic group behaviors aswell as panic emotion dynamics in a crowd in multi-hazard environments.

Neutrino Physics with JUNO

  The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purposeunderground liquid scintillator detector, was proposed with the determinationof the neutrino mass hierarchy as a primary physics goal. It is also capable ofobserving neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, includingsupernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos,atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such asnucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physicsmotivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for variousproposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plantsat 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4sigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrinospectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the sixoscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\%. Neutrino burst from atypical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000inverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elasticscattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable informationon the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrinoenergy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400events per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrinosamples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. protondecay via the $p\to K^++\bar\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will providea unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle andastrophysics. It holds the great potential for further advancing our quest tounderstanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, one of the buildingblocks of our Universe.
