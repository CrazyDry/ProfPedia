  In this paper we determine the value of the best constants in the 2-uniformPL-convexity estimates of $\mathbb C$. This solves a problem posed by W. J.Davis, D. J. H. Garling and N. Tomczak-Jaegermann.

Coherent states sometimes look like squeezed states, and visa versa: The  Paul trap

  Using the Paul Trap as a model, we point out that the same wave functions canbe variously coherent or squeezed states, depending upon the system they areapplied to.

Efficient Parallel Estimation for Markov Random Fields

  We present a new, deterministic, distributed MAP estimation algorithm forMarkov Random Fields called Local Highest Confidence First (Local HCF). Thealgorithm has been applied to segmentation problems in computer vision and itsperformance compared with stochastic algorithms. The experiments show thatLocal HCF finds better estimates than stochastic algorithms with much lesscomputation.

New results for the degree/diameter problem

  The results of computer searches for large graphs with given (small) degreeand diameter are presented. The new graphs are Cayley graphs of semidirectproducts of cyclic groups and related groups. One fundamental use of our``dense graphs'' is in the design of efficient communication networktopologies.

The Australia Telescope 20GHz Survey: Hardware, Observing Strategy, and  Scanning Survey Catalog

  The Australia Telescope 20GHz (AT20G) survey is a large area (2{\pi} sr),sensitive (40mJy), high frequency (20GHz) survey of the southern sky. Thesurvey was conducted in two parts: an initial fast scanning survey, and aseries of more accurate follow-up observations. The follow-up survey cataloghas been presented by Murphy et al. 2010. In this paper we discuss the hardwaresetup and scanning survey strategy as well as the production of the scanningsurvey catalog.

Scanned Potential Microscopy of Edge and Bulk Currents in the Quantum  Hall Regime

  Using an atomic force microscope as a local voltmeter, we measure the Hallvoltage profile in a 2D electron gas in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. Weobserve a linear profile in the bulk of the sample in the transition regionsbetween QH plateaus and a distinctly nonlinear profile on the plateaus. Inaddition, localized voltage drops are observed at the sample edges in thetransition regions. We interpret these results in terms of theories of edge andbulk currents in the QH regime.

  The lithium ions in Lithium iron arsenide phases with compositions close toLiFeAs have been located using powder neutron diffraction. These phases exhibitsuperconductivity at temperatures at least as high as 16 K demonstrating thatsuperconductivity in compounds with [FeAs]- anti-PbO-type anionic layers occursin compounds with at least three different structure types and occurs for awide range of As-Fe-As bond angles.

A Second Giant Planet in 3:2 Mean-Motion Resonance in the HD 204313  System

  We present 8 years of high-precision radial velocity (RV) data for HD 204313from the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory. The star isknown to have a giant planet (M sin i = 3.5 M_J) on a ~1900-day orbit, and aNeptune-mass planet at 0.2 AU. Using our own data in combination with thepublished CORALIE RVs of Segransan et al. (2010), we discover an outer Jovian(M sin i = 1.6 M_J) planet with P ~ 2800 days. Our orbital fit suggests theplanets are in a 3:2 mean motion resonance, which would potentially affecttheir stability. We perform a detailed stability analysis, and verify theplanets must be in resonance.

The 40Ca(alpha,gamma)44Ti reaction in the energy regime of supernova  nucleosynthesis

  The 44Ti(t1/2 = 59 y) nuclide, an important signature of supernovanucleosynthesis, has recently been observed as live radioactivity by gamma-rayastronomy from the Cas A remnant. We investigate in the laboratory the major44Ti production reaction, 40Ca(alpha,gamma)44Ti (E_cm = 0.6-1.2 MeV/u), bydirect off- line counting of 44Ti nuclei. The yield, significantly higher thaninferred from previous experiments, is analyzed in terms of a statistical modelusing microscopic nuclear inputs. The associated stellar rate has importantastrophysical consequences, increasing the calculated supernova 44Ti yield by afactor ~2 over previous estimates and bringing it closer to Cas A observations.

Graph Saturation in Multipartite Graphs

  Let $G$ be a fixed graph and let ${\mathcal F}$ be a family of graphs. Asubgraph $J$ of $G$ is ${\mathcal F}$-saturated if no member of ${\mathcal F}$is a subgraph of $J$, but for any edge $e$ in $E(G)-E(J)$, some element of${\mathcal F}$ is a subgraph of $J+e$. We let $\text{ex}({\mathcal F},G)$ and$\text{sat}({\mathcal F},G)$ denote the maximum and minimum size of an${\mathcal F}$-saturated subgraph of $G$, respectively. If no element of${\mathcal F}$ is a subgraph of $G$, then $\text{sat}({\mathcal F},G) =\text{ex}({\mathcal F}, G) = |E(G)|$.  In this paper, for $k\ge 3$ and $n\ge 100$ we determine$\text{sat}(K_3,K_k^n)$, where $K_k^n$ is the complete balanced $k$-partitegraph with partite sets of size $n$. We also give several families ofconstructions of $K_t$-saturated subgraphs of $K_k^n$ for $t\ge 4$. Our resultsand constructions provide an informative contrast to recent results on theedge-density version of $\text{ex}(K_t,K_k^n)$ from [A. Bondy, J. Shen, S.Thomass\'e, and C. Thomassen, Density conditions for triangles in multipartitegraphs, Combinatorica 26 (2006), 121--131] and [F. Pfender, Complete subgraphsin multipartite graphs, Combinatorica 32 (2012), no. 4, 483--495].

Carbon Monoxide in Comet 9P/Tempel 1 before and after the Deep Impact  Encounter

  One of the goals of the Hubble Space Telescope program to observe periodiccomet 9P/Tempel 1 in conjunction with NASA's Deep Impact mission was to studythe generation and evolution of the gaseous coma resulting from the impact. Forthis purpose, the Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys wasused with the F140LP filter which is sensitive primarily to the ultravioletemission (>1400 A) from the CO Fourth Positive system. Following the impact wedetected an increase in brightness, which if all due to CO corresponds to 1.5 x10^31 molecules or a mass of 6.6 x 10^5 kg, an amount that would normally beproduced by 7-10 hours of quiescent outgassing from the comet. This number isless than or equal to 10% of the number of water molecules excavated, andsuggests that the volatile content of the material excavated by the impact didnot differ significantly from the surface or near sub-surface materialresponsible for the quiescent outgassing of the comet.

Spontaneous CP Violation: Alternative to the Standard Model

  We propose a model of soft CP violation that evades the strong CP problem andcan describe observed CP violation in the neutral kaon sector, both direct andindirect. Our model requires two ``duark'' mesons carrying quark number twothat have complex (CP-violating) bare masses and are coupled to quark pairs.Aside from the existence of these potentially observable new particles withmasses of several hundred GeV, we predict a flat unitarity triangle ({\iti.e.,} no observable direct CP violation in the $B$-meson sector) and apossibly anomalous branching ratio for the decay mode $K^+\to \pi^++\bar{\nu}\nu$.

Secretly Eccentric: The Giant Planet and Activity Cycle of GJ 328

  We announce the discovery of a ~2 Jupiter-mass planet in an eccentric 11-yearorbit around the K7/M0 dwarf GJ 328. Our result is based on 10 years' worth ofradial velocity (RV) data from the Hobby-Eberly and Harlan J. Smith telescopesat McDonald Observatory, and from the Keck Telescope at Mauna Kea. Our analysisof GJ 328's magnetic activity via the Na I D features reveals a long-periodstellar activity cycle, which creates an additional signal in the star's RVcurve with amplitude 6-10 m/s. After correcting for this stellar RVcontribution, we see that the orbit of the planet is more eccentric thansuggested by the raw RV data. GJ 328b is currently the most massive,longest-period planet discovered around a low-mass dwarf.

Interaction of Cygnus A with its environment

  Cygnus A, the nearest truly powerful radio galaxy, resides at the centre of amassive galaxy cluster. Chandra X-ray observations reveal its cocoon shocks,radio lobe cavities and an X-ray jet, which are discussed here. It is arguedthat X-ray emission from the outer regions of the cocoon shocks is nonthermal.The X-ray jets are best interpreted as synchrotron emission, suggesting thatthey, rather than the radio jets, are the path of energy flow from the nucleusto the hotspots. In that case, a model shows that the jet flow isnon-relativistic and carries in excess of one solar mass per year.

Gamma-ray bursts: Restarting the Engine

  Recent gamma-ray burst observations have revealed late-time, highly energeticevents which deviate from the simplest expectations of the standard fireballpicture. Instead they may indicate that the central engine is active orrestarted at late times. We suggest that fragmentation and subsequent accretionduring the collapse of a rapidly rotating stellar core offers a naturalmechanism for this.

XMM-Newton view of MS0735+7421: the most energetic AGN outburst in a  galaxy cluster

  We discuss the possible cosmological effects of powerful AGN outbursts ingalaxy clusters by starting from the results of an XMM-Newton observation ofthe supercavity cluster MS0735+7421.

Partially ionized plasmas in electromagnetic fields

  The interaction of partially ionized plasmas with an electromagnetic field isinvestigated using quantum statistical methods. A general statisticalexpression for the current density of a plasma in an electromagnetic field ispresented and considered in the high field regime. Expressions for thecollisional absorption are derived and discussed. Further, partially ionizedplasmas are considered. Plasma Bloch equations for the description ofbound-free transitions are given and the absorption coefficient as well as ratecoefficients for multiphoton ionization are derived and numerical results arepresented.

Extending Continuum Models for Atom Probe Simulation

  This work describes extensions to existing level-set algorithms developed forapplication within the field of Atom Probe Tomography (APT). We present a newsimulation tool for the simulation of 3D tomographic volumes, using advancedlevel set methods. By combining narrow-band, B-Tree and particle-tracingapproaches from level-set methods, we demonstrate a practical tool forsimulating shape changes to APT samples under applied electrostatic fields, inthree dimensions. This work builds upon our previous studies by allowing fornon-axially symmetric solutions, with minimal loss in computational speed,whilst retaining numerical accuracy.

Learning Multilingual Topics from Incomparable Corpus

  Multilingual topic models enable crosslingual tasks by extracting consistenttopics from multilingual corpora. Most models require parallel or comparabletraining corpora, which limits their ability to generalize. In this paper, wefirst demystify the knowledge transfer mechanism behind multilingual topicmodels by defining an alternative but equivalent formulation. Based on thisanalysis, we then relax the assumption of training data required by mostexisting models, creating a model that only requires a dictionary for training.Experiments show that our new method effectively learns coherent multilingualtopics from partially and fully incomparable corpora with limited amounts ofdictionary resources.

Understanding Crosslingual Transfer Mechanisms in Probabilistic Topic  Modeling

  Probabilistic topic modeling is a popular choice as the first step ofcrosslingual tasks to enable knowledge transfer and extract multilingualfeatures. While many multilingual topic models have been developed, theirassumptions on the training corpus are quite varied, and it is not clear howwell the models can be applied under various training conditions. In thispaper, we systematically study the knowledge transfer mechanisms behinddifferent multilingual topic models, and through a broad set of experimentswith four models on ten languages, we provide empirical insights that caninform the selection and future development of multilingual topic models.

Laser remote magnetometry using mesospheric sodium

  We have demonstrated a remote magnetometer based on sodium atoms in theEarth's mesosphere, at a 106-kilometer distance from our instrument. A1.33-watt laser illuminated the atoms, and the magnetic field was inferred fromback-scattered light collected by a telescope with a 1.55-meter-diameteraperture. The measurement sensitivity was 162 nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$. The value ofmagnetic field inferred from our measurement is consistent with an estimatebased on the Earth's known field shape to within a fraction of a percent.Projected improvements in optics could lead to sensitivity of 20nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$, and the use of advanced lasers or a large telescope couldapproach 1-nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ sensitivity. All experimental and theoreticalsensitivity values are based on a 60$^\circ$ angle between the laser beam axisand the magnetic field vector; at the optimal 90$^\circ$ angle sensitivitywould be improved by about a factor of two.

The Dependence of Halo Mass on Galaxy Size at Fixed Stellar Mass Using  Weak Lensing

  Stellar mass has been shown to correlate with halo mass, with non-negligiblescatter. The stellar mass-size and luminosity-size relationships of galaxiesalso show significant scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. It ispossible that, at fixed stellar mass and galaxy colour, the halo mass iscorrelated with galaxy size. Galaxy-galaxy lensing allows us to measure themean masses of dark matter haloes for stacked samples of galaxies. We extendthe analysis of the galaxies in the CFHTLenS catalogue by fitting singleS\'{e}rsic surface brightness profiles to the lens galaxies in order to recoverhalf-light radius values, allowing us to determine halo masses for lensesaccording to their size. Comparing our halo masses and sizes to baselines forthat stellar mass yields a differential measurement of the halo mass-galaxysize relationship at fixed stellar mass, defined as $M_{h}(M_{*}) \proptor_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\eta}(M_{*})$. We find that on average, our lens galaxieshave an $\eta = 0.42\pm0.12$, i.e. larger galaxies live in more massive darkmatter haloes. The $\eta$ is strongest for high mass luminous red galaxies(LRGs). Investigation of this relationship in hydrodynamical simulationssuggests that, at a fixed $M_{*}$, satellite galaxies have a larger $\eta$ andgreater scatter in the $M_{\mathrm{h}}$ and $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ relationshipcompared to central galaxies.

Observation of X-ray variability in the BL Lac object 1ES1959+65

  This paper reports X-ray spectral observations of a relatively nearby z =0.048 BL Lacertae (BL Lac) object 1ES1959+650, which is a potential TeVemitter. The observations include 31 short pointings made by the UnconventionalStellar Aspect (USA) Experiment on board the Advanced Research and GlobalObservation Satellite (ARGOS), and 17 pointings by the PCA on board the RossiX-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Most of these observations were spaced by lessthan 1 day. \es was detected by the ARGOS USA detector in the range 1-16 keV,and by the PCA in the 2-16 keV range but at different times. During the closelyspaced RXTE observations beginning on 2000 July 28, an ending of one flare anda start of another are visible, associated with spectral changes, where thephoton index Gamma ranges between ~ 1.4 and 1.7, and the spectrum is harderwhen the source is brighter. This implies that 1ES1959 is an XBL-type blazar,with the X-ray emission likely to originate via the synchrotron process. TheUSA observations reveal another flare that peaked on 2000 November 14 anddoubled the flux within a few days, again associated with spectral changes ofthe same form. The spectral variability correlated with the flux and timingcharacteristics of this object that are similar to those of other nearby BLLacs, and suggest relativistic beaming with a Doppler factor delta > 1.6 andmagnetic fields of the order of a few mG. We also suggest that the steadycomponent of the X-ray emission -- present in this object as well as in otherXBLs -- may be due to the large-scale relativistic jet (such as measured byChandra in many radio-loud AGN), but pointing very closely to our line ofsight.

The First FIRST Gravitationally Lensed Quasar: FBQ 0951+2635

  The V=16.9 quasar FBQ 0951+2635 at redshift z=1.24 appears double on CCDexposures taken in subarcsecond seeing. The two objects are separated by 1.1"and differ in brightness by 0.9 mag. VLA observations show the radio source tobe double with the same separation and position angle. Spectra taken with theKeck II telescope show the two components to have nearly identical emissionline spectra, but with somewhat different absorption line systems. Subtractionof two stellar point spread functions from the pair of components consistentlyleaves a residual object. Depending upon whether this third object is extendedor a point source it may be as much as 1/10 or as little as 1/100 as bright asthe brighter QSO component. The observations leave no doubt that the 2 brighterobjects are gravitationally lensed images of the same quasar. The third objectmight be either the lensing galaxy or a third image of the quasar, but bothinterpretations have serious shortcomings.

First scattered light images of debris disks around HD 53143 and HD  139664

  We present the first scattered light images of debris disks around a K star(HD 53143) and an F star (HD 139664) using the coronagraphic mode of theAdvanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Withages 0.3 - 1 Gyr, these are among the oldest optically detected debris disks.HD 53143, viewed ~45 degrees from edge-on, does not show radial variation indisk structure and has width >55 AU. HD 139664 is seen close to edge-on and hasbelt-like morphology with a dust peak 83 AU from the star and a distinct outerboundary at 109 AU. We discuss evidence for significant diversity in the radialarchitecture of debris disks that appears unconnected to stellar spectral typeor age. HD 139664 and possibly the solar system belong in a category of narrowbelts 20-30 AU wide. HD 53143 represents a class of wide disk architecture withcharacteristic width >50 AU.

Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 with Alice/Rosetta during  the Deep Impact Encounter

  We report on spectroscopic observations of periodic comet 9P/Tempel 1 by theAlice ultraviolet spectrograph on the Rosetta spacecraft in conjunction withNASA's Deep Impact mission. Our objectives were to measure an increase inatomic and molecular emissions produced by the excavation of volatilesub-surface material. We unambiguously detected atomic oxygen emission from thequiescent coma but no enhancement at the 10% (1-sigma) level following theimpact. We derive a quiescent water production rate of 9 x 10^27 molecules persecond with an estimated uncertainty of 30%. Our upper limits to the volatilesproduced by the impact are consistent with other estimates.

Serpens Cluster B and VV Ser Observed With High Spatial Resolution at  70, 160, and 350um

  We report on diffraction-limited observations in the far-infrared and sub-millimeter of the Cluster B region of Serpens (G3-G6 Cluster) and of the HerbigBe star to the south, VV Ser. The observations were made with the Spitzer MIPSinstrument in fine-scale mode at 70um, in normal mapping mode at 160um (VV Seronly), and the CSO SHARC-II camera at 350um (Cluster B only). We use these datato define the spectral energy distributions of the tightly grouped members ofCluster B, many of whose SEDs peak in the far-infrared. We compare our resultsto those of the c2d survey of Serpens and to published models for thefar-infrared emission from VV Ser. We find that values of Lbol and Tbolcalculated with our new photometry show only modest changes from previousvalues, and that most source SED classifications remain unchanged.

Two-Dimensional Arrays of RF Ion Traps with Addressable Interactions

  We describe the advantages of 2-dimensional, addressable arrays of sphericalPaul traps. They would provide for the ability to address and tailor theinteraction strengths of trapped objects in 2D and could establish a valuablenew tool for quantum information processing. Simulations of trapping ions arecompared to first tests using printed circuit board trap arrays loaded withdust particles. Pair-wise interactions in the array are addressed by means ofan adjustable radio-frequency (RF) electrode shared between trapping sites. Byattenuating this RF electrode potential, neighboring pairs of trapped objectshave their interaction strength increase and are moved closer to one another.In the limit of the adjustable electrode being held at RF ground, the twoformerly spherical traps are merged into one linear Paul trap.

Surface Roughness Dominated Pinning Mechanism of Magnetic Vortices in  Soft Ferromagnetic Films

  Although pinning of domain walls in ferromagnets is ubiquitous, the absenceof an appropriate characterization tool has limited the ability to correlatethe physical and magnetic microstructures of ferromagnetic films with specificpinning mechanisms. Here, we show that the pinning of a magnetic vortex, thesimplest possible domain structure in soft ferromagnets, is strongly correlatedwith surface roughness, and we make a quantitative comparison of the pinningenergy and spatial range in films of various thickness. The results demonstratethat thickness fluctuations on the lateral length scale of the vortex corediameter, i.e. an effective roughness at a specific length scale, provides thedominant pinning mechanism. We argue that this mechanism will be important invirtually any soft ferromagnetic film.

Operator-Like Wavelet Bases of $L_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$

  The connection between derivative operators and wavelets is well known. Herewe generalize the concept by constructing multiresolution approximations andwavelet basis functions that act like Fourier multiplier operators. Thisconstruction follows from a stochastic model: signals are tempereddistributions such that the application of a whitening (differential) operatorresults in a realization of a sparse white noise. Using wavelets constructedfrom these operators, the sparsity of the white noise can be inherited by thewavelet coefficients. In this paper, we specify such wavelets in fullgenerality and determine their properties in terms of the underlying operator.

Decay properties of Riesz transforms and steerable wavelets

  The Riesz transform is a natural multi-dimensional extension of the Hilberttransform, and it has been the object of study for many years due to its nicemathematical properties. More recently, the Riesz transform and its variantshave been used to construct complex wavelets and steerable wavelet frames inhigher dimensions. The flip side of this approach, however, is that the Riesztransform of a wavelet often has slow decay. One can nevertheless overcome thisproblem by requiring the original wavelet to have sufficient smoothness, decay,and vanishing moments. In this paper, we derive necessary conditions in termsof these three properties that guarantee the decay of the Riesz transform andits variants, and as an application, we show how the decay of the popularSimoncelli wavelets can be improved by appropriately modifying their Fouriertransforms. By applying the Riesz transform to these new wavelets, we obtainsteerable frames with rapid decay.

Non-destructive shadowgraph imaging of ultracold atoms

  An imaging system is presented that is capable of far-detuned non-destructiveimaging of a Bose-Einstein condensate with the signal proportional to thesecond spatial derivative of the density. Whilst demonstrated with applicationto $^{85}\text{Rb}$, the technique generalizes to other atomic species and isshown to be capable of a signal to noise of ${\sim}25$ at $1$GHz detuning with$100$ in-trap images showing no observable heating or atom loss. The techniqueis also applied to the observation of individual trajectories of stochasticdynamics inaccessible to single shot imaging. Coupled with a fast optical phaselock loop, the system is capable of dynamically switching to resonantabsorption imaging during the experiment.

Cs$^{+}$ Solvated in Hydrogen - Evidence for Several Distinct Solvation  Shells

  Helium nanodroplets are doped with cesium and molecular hydrogen andsubsequently ionized by electrons. Mass spectra reveal H$_x$Cs$^{+}$ ions thatcontain as many as 130 hydrogen atoms. Two features in the spectra arestriking: First, the abundance of ions with an odd number of hydrogen atoms isvery low; the abundance of HCs$^+$ is only 1 % that of H$_2$Cs$^+$. Thedominance of even-numbered species is in stark contrast to previous studies ofpure or doped hydrogen cluster ions. Second, the abundance of (H$_2$)$_n$Cs$^+$features anomalies at n = 8, 12, 32, 44, and 52. Guided by previous work onions solvated in hydrogen and helium we assign the anomalies at n = 12, 32, 44to the formation of three concentric, solid-like solvation shells oficosahedral symmetry around Cs$^+$. Preliminary density functional theorycalculations for n $\le$ 14 are reported as well.

Resonant electron attachment to mixed hydrogen/oxygen and  deuterium/oxygen clusters

  Low energy electron attachment to mixed (H$_2$)$_x$/(O$_2$)$_y$ clusters andtheir deuterated analogues has been investigated for the first time. Theseexperiments were carried out using liquid helium nanodroplets to form theclusters, and the effect of the added electron was then monitored via massspectrometry. There are some important differences between electron attachmentto the pure clusters and to the mixed clusters. A particularly notable featureis the formation of HO$_2$$^{-}$ and H$_2$O$^{-}$ ions from an electron-inducedchemical reaction between the two dopants. The chemistry leading to theseanions appears to be driven by electron resonances associated with H$_2$ ratherthan O$_2$. The electron resonances for H$_2$ can lead to dissociative electronattachment (DEA), just as for the free H$_2$ molecule. However, there isevidence that the resonance in H$_2$ can also lead to rapid electron transferto O$_2$, which then induces DEA of the O$_2$. This kind of excitation transferhas not, as far as we are aware, been reported previously

Dynamical Bonding Driving Mixed Valency in a Metal Boride

  Samarium hexaboride is an anomaly, having many exotic and seemingly mutuallyincompatible properties. It was proposed to be a mixed-valent semiconductor,and later - a topological Kondo insulator, and yet has a Fermi surface despitebeing an insulator. We propose a new and unified understanding of SmB6 centeredon the hitherto unrecognized dynamical bonding effect: the coexistence of twoSm-B bonding modes within SmB6, corresponding to different oxidation states ofthe Sm. The mixed valency arises in SmB6 from thermal population of thesedistinct minima enabled by motion of B. Our model simultaneously explains thethermal valence fluctuations, appearance of magnetic Fermi surface, excessentropy at low temperatures, pressure-induced phase transitions, and relatedfeatures in Raman spectra and their unexpected dependence on temperature andboron isotope.

The dwarf galaxy population in Abell 2218

  We present results from a deep photometric study of the rich galaxy clusterAbell 2218 (z=0.18) based on archival HST WFPC2 F606W images. These have beenused to derive the luminosity function to extremely faint limits(M_{F606W}=-13.2 mag, mu_{0}=24.7 mag arcsec^{-2}) over a wide field of view(1.3 h^{-2} Mpc^2). We find the faint-end slope of the luminosity function tovary with environment within the cluster, going from alpha=-1.23\pm0.13 withinthe projected central core of the cluster (100 < r < 300 h^{-1} kpc) toalpha=-1.49\pm 0.06 outside this radius (300 < r < 750 h^{-1} kpc). We inferthat the core is 'dwarf depleted', and further quantify this by studying theratio of 'dwarf' to 'giant' galaxies and its dependency as a function ofcluster-centric radius and local galaxy density. We find that this ratio variesstrongly with both quantities, and that the dwarf galaxy population in A2218has a more extended distribution than the giant galaxy population.

Regularized Ordinal Regression and the ordinalNet R Package

  Regularization techniques such as the lasso (Tibshirani 1996) and elastic net(Zou and Hastie 2005) can be used to improve regression model coefficientestimation and prediction accuracy, as well as to perform variable selection.Ordinal regression models are widely used in applications where the use ofregularization could be beneficial; however, these models are not included inmany popular software packages for regularized regression. We propose acoordinate descent algorithm to fit a broad class of ordinal regression modelswith an elastic net penalty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each model inthis class generalizes to a more flexible form, for instance to accommodateunordered categorical data. We introduce an elastic net penalty class thatapplies to both model forms. Additionally, this penalty can be used to shrink anon-ordinal model toward its ordinal counterpart. Finally, we introduce the Rpackage ordinalNet, which implements the algorithm for this model class.

Characterizing solute hydrogen and hydrides in pure and alloyed titanium  at the atomic scale

  Ti has a high affinity for hydrogen and is a typical hydride formers.Ti-hydride are brittle phases which probably cause premature failure ofTi-alloys. Here, we used atom probe tomography and electron microscopy toinvestigate the hydrogen distribution in a set of specimens of commerciallypure Ti, model and commercial Ti-alloys. Although likely partly introducedduring specimen preparation with the focused-ion beam, we show formation ofTi-hydrides along {\alpha} grain boundaries and {\alpha}/\b{eta} phaseboundaries in commercial pure Ti and {\alpha}+\b{eta} binary model alloys. Nohydrides are observed in the {\alpha} phase in alloys with Al addition orquenched-in Mo supersaturation.

Quantifying Temperature-dependent Substrate Loss in GaN-on-Si RF  Technology

  Intrinsic limits to temperature-dependent substrate loss for GaN-on-Sitechnology, due to the change in resistivity of the substrate with temperature,are evaluated using an experimentally validated device simulation framework.Effect of room temperature substrate resistivity on temperature-dependent CPWline loss at various operating frequency bands are then presented. CPW linesfor GaN-on-high resistivity Si are shown to have a pronouncedtemperature-dependence for temperatures above 150{\deg}C and have lowersubstrate losses for frequencies above the X-band. On the other hand,GaN-on-low resistivity Si is shown to be more temperature-insensitive and havelower substrate losses than even HR-Si for lower operating frequencies. Theeffect of various CPW geometries on substrate loss is also presented togeneralize the discussion. These results are expected to act as a benchmark fortemperature dependent substrate loss in GaN-on-Si RF technology.

Eclipse Timings of the Transient Low Mass X-ray Binary EXO0748-676. IV.  The Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer Eclipses

  We report our complete database of X-ray eclipse timings of the low massX-ray binary EXO0748-676 observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)satellite. As of this writing we have accumulated 443 full X-ray eclipses, 392of which have been observed with the Proportional Counter Array on RXTE. Theseinclude both observations where an eclipse was specifically targeted and thoseeclipses found in the RXTE data archive. Eclipse cycle count has beenmaintained since the discovery of the EXO0748-676 system in February 1985. Wedescribe our observing and analysis techniques for each eclipse and describeimprovements we have made since the last compilation by Wolff et al. (2002).The principal result of this paper is the database containing the timingresults from a seven-parameter fit to the X-ray light curve for each observedeclipse along with the associated errors in the fitted parameters. Based on thestandard O-C analysis, EXO0748-676 has undergone four distinct orbital periodepochs since its discovery. In addition, EXO0748-676 shows small-scale eventsin the O-C curve that are likely due to short-lived changes in the secondarystar.

Overview of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument

  The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is under construction tomeasure the expansion history of the Universe using the Baryon AcousticOscillation technique. The spectra of 35 million galaxies and quasars over14000 square degrees will be measured during the life of the experiment. A newprime focus corrector for the KPNO Mayall telescope will deliver light to 5000fiber optic positioners. The fibers in turn feed ten broad-band spectrographs.We present an overview of the instrumentation, the main technical requirementsand challenges, and the current status of the project.

Hot DB White Dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

  We present ugriz photometry and optical spectroscopy for 28 DB and DO whitedwarfs with temperatures between 28,000K and 45,000K. About 10 of these areparticularly well-observed; the remainder are candidates. These are the hottestDB stars yet found, and they populate the "DB gap" between the hotter DO starsand the familiar DB stars cooler than 30,000K. Nevertheless, after carefullymatching the survey volumes, we find that the ratio of DA stars to DB/DO starsis a factor of 2.5 larger at 30,000 K than at 20,000 K, suggesting that the "DBgap" is indeed deficient and that some kind of atmospheric transformation takesplace in roughly 10% of DA stars as they cool from 30,000 K to 20,000 K.

The McDonald Observatory Planet Search: New Long-Period Giant Planets,  and Two Interacting Jupiters in the HD 155358 System

  We present high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations of foursolar-type (F7-G5) stars - HD 79498, HD 155358, HD 197037, and HD 220773 -taken as part of the McDonald Observatory Planet Search Program. For each ofthese stars, we see evidence of Keplerian motion caused by the presence of oneor more gas giant planets in long-period orbits. We derive orbital parametersfor each system, and note the properties (composition, activity, etc.) of thehost stars. While we have previously announced the two-gas-giant HD 155358system, we now report a shorter period for planet c. This new period isconsistent with the planets being trapped in mutual 2:1 mean-motion resonance.We therefore perform an in-depth stability analysis, placing additionalconstraints on the orbital parameters of the planets. These results demonstratethe excellent long-term RV stability of the spectrometers on both the Harlan J.Smith 2.7 m telescope and the Hobby-Eberly telescope.

A Strong X-Ray Burst from the Low Mass X-Ray Binary EXO0748-676

  We have observed an unusually strong X-ray burst as a part of our regulareclipse timing observations of the low mass binary system EXO0748-676. Theburst peak flux was 5.2x10^-8 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, approximately five times thenormal peak X-ray burst flux observed from this source by RXTE. Spectral fitsto the data strongly suggest that photospheric radius expansion occurred duringthe burst. In this Letter we examine the properties of this X-ray burst, whichis the first example of a radius expansion burst from EXO0748-676 observed byRXTE. We find no evidence for coherent burst oscillations. Assuming that thepeak burst luminosity is the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4 solar mass neutronstar we derive a distance to EXO0748-676 of 7.7 kpc for a helium-dominatedburst photosphere and 5.9 kpc for a hydrogen-dominated burst photosphere.

Designing Attractive Models via Automated Identification of Chaotic and  Oscillatory Dynamical Regimes

  Chaos and oscillations continue to capture the interest of both thescientific and public domains. Yet despite the importance of these qualitativefeatures, most attempts at constructing mathematical models of such phenomenahave taken an indirect, quantitative approach, e.g. by fitting models to afinite number of data-points. Here we develop a qualitative inference frameworkthat allows us to both reverse engineer and design systems exhibiting these andother dynamical behaviours by directly specifying the desired characteristicsof the underlying dynamical attractor. This change in perspective fromquantitative to qualitative dynamics, provides fundamental and new insightsinto the properties of dynamical systems.

A Case Study: Novel Group Interactions through Introductory  Computational Physics

  With the advent of high-level programming languages capable of quicklyrendering three-dimensional simulations, the inclusion of computers as alearning tool in the classroom has become more prevalent. Although work hasbegun to study the patterns seen in implementing and assessing computation inintroductory physics, more insight is needed to understand the observed effectsof blending computation with physics in a group setting. In a newly adoptedformat of introductory calculus-based mechanics, called Projects and Practicesin Physics, groups of students work on short modeling projects -- which makeuse of a novel inquiry-based approach -- to develop their understanding of bothphysics content and practice. Preliminary analyses of observational data ofgroups engaging with computation, coupled with synchronized computerscreencast, has revealed a unique group interaction afforded by the practicesspecific to computational physics -- problem debugging.

Decontaminating Swift UVOT Grism Observations of Transient Sources

  We present a new technique of decontaminating Swift UVOT grism spectra fortransient objects. We describe the template image requirements and imageprocessing steps necessary to successfully implement the empiricaldecontamination technique. We demonstrate the accuracy of the flux andwavelength calibrations for decontaminated spectra by comparing a spectrum ofSN 2011fe with a well-calibrated, long-slit ultraviolet spectrum from theHubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. We also show howthe decontamination removes spurious emission lines from spectra of iPTF14bdnwhich otherwise could be misinterpreted as coming from the supernova. Thesoftware which implements this technique is briefly discussed and is madeavailable to the community.

Analytical formulation for the bend-loss in single-ring hollow-core  photonic crystal fibers

  Understanding bend-loss in single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fibers isbecoming of increasing importance as the fibers enter practical applications.While purely numerical approaches are useful, there is a need for a simpleranalytical formalism that provides physical insight and can be directly used inthe design of PCFs with low bend-loss. We show theoretically and experimentallythat a wavelength-dependent critical bend radius exists below which thebend-loss reaches a maximum, and that this can be calculated from thestructural parameters of a fiber using a simple analytical formula. This allowsstraightforward design of single-ring PCFs that are bend-insensitive forspecified ranges of bend radius and wavelength. It also can be used to derivean expression for the bend radius that yields optimal higher-order modesuppression for a given fiber structure.

Serendipity and the SDSS: Discovery of the Largest Known Planetary  Nebula on the Sky

  Investigation of spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey reveals thepresence of a region of ionized gas of >2 degrees diameter centeredapproximately at alpha = 10^h 37^m delta = -00^o 18' (J2000) (Galacticcoordinates l=248, b=+48). [OIII] 4959,5007 emission is particularly strong andemission from H-alpha and [NII] 6548,6583 is also detectable over a substantialarea on the sky. The combination of emission line ratios, the close to zeroheliocentric radial velocity and the morphology of the structure are consistentwith an identification as a very nearby planetary nebula. The proximity of thehot, DO white dwarf PG1034+001 further strengthens this interpretation. Theobject is: i) the largest planetary nebula on the sky, ii) certainly closerthan any planetary nebula other than Sh 2--216, iii) the first to beunambiguously associated with a DO white dwarf. A parallax distance forPG1034+001 would establish whether the structure is in fact the closest, andone of the physically largest, planetary nebula known.
