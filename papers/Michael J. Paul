Sharp Complex Convexity Estimates

  In this paper we determine the value of the best constants in the 2-uniform
PL-convexity estimates of $\mathbb C$. This solves a problem posed by W. J.
Davis, D. J. H. Garling and N. Tomczak-Jaegermann.


Coherent states sometimes look like squeezed states, and visa versa: The
  Paul trap

  Using the Paul Trap as a model, we point out that the same wave functions can
be variously coherent or squeezed states, depending upon the system they are
applied to.


Efficient Parallel Estimation for Markov Random Fields

  We present a new, deterministic, distributed MAP estimation algorithm for
Markov Random Fields called Local Highest Confidence First (Local HCF). The
algorithm has been applied to segmentation problems in computer vision and its
performance compared with stochastic algorithms. The experiments show that
Local HCF finds better estimates than stochastic algorithms with much less
computation.


New results for the degree/diameter problem

  The results of computer searches for large graphs with given (small) degree
and diameter are presented. The new graphs are Cayley graphs of semidirect
products of cyclic groups and related groups. One fundamental use of our
``dense graphs'' is in the design of efficient communication network
topologies.


The Australia Telescope 20GHz Survey: Hardware, Observing Strategy, and
  Scanning Survey Catalog

  The Australia Telescope 20GHz (AT20G) survey is a large area (2{\pi} sr),
sensitive (40mJy), high frequency (20GHz) survey of the southern sky. The
survey was conducted in two parts: an initial fast scanning survey, and a
series of more accurate follow-up observations. The follow-up survey catalog
has been presented by Murphy et al. 2010. In this paper we discuss the hardware
setup and scanning survey strategy as well as the production of the scanning
survey catalog.


Scanned Potential Microscopy of Edge and Bulk Currents in the Quantum
  Hall Regime

  Using an atomic force microscope as a local voltmeter, we measure the Hall
voltage profile in a 2D electron gas in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. We
observe a linear profile in the bulk of the sample in the transition regions
between QH plateaus and a distinctly nonlinear profile on the plateaus. In
addition, localized voltage drops are observed at the sample edges in the
transition regions. We interpret these results in terms of theories of edge and
bulk currents in the QH regime.

Structure and superconductivity of LiFeAs

  The lithium ions in Lithium iron arsenide phases with compositions close to
LiFeAs have been located using powder neutron diffraction. These phases exhibit
superconductivity at temperatures at least as high as 16 K demonstrating that
superconductivity in compounds with [FeAs]- anti-PbO-type anionic layers occurs
in compounds with at least three different structure types and occurs for a
wide range of As-Fe-As bond angles.


A Second Giant Planet in 3:2 Mean-Motion Resonance in the HD 204313
  System

  We present 8 years of high-precision radial velocity (RV) data for HD 204313
from the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory. The star is
known to have a giant planet (M sin i = 3.5 M_J) on a ~1900-day orbit, and a
Neptune-mass planet at 0.2 AU. Using our own data in combination with the
published CORALIE RVs of Segransan et al. (2010), we discover an outer Jovian
(M sin i = 1.6 M_J) planet with P ~ 2800 days. Our orbital fit suggests the
planets are in a 3:2 mean motion resonance, which would potentially affect
their stability. We perform a detailed stability analysis, and verify the
planets must be in resonance.


The 40Ca(alpha,gamma)44Ti reaction in the energy regime of supernova
  nucleosynthesis

  The 44Ti(t1/2 = 59 y) nuclide, an important signature of supernova
nucleosynthesis, has recently been observed as live radioactivity by gamma-ray
astronomy from the Cas A remnant. We investigate in the laboratory the major
44Ti production reaction, 40Ca(alpha,gamma)44Ti (E_cm = 0.6-1.2 MeV/u), by
direct off- line counting of 44Ti nuclei. The yield, significantly higher than
inferred from previous experiments, is analyzed in terms of a statistical model
using microscopic nuclear inputs. The associated stellar rate has important
astrophysical consequences, increasing the calculated supernova 44Ti yield by a
factor ~2 over previous estimates and bringing it closer to Cas A observations.


Graph Saturation in Multipartite Graphs

  Let $G$ be a fixed graph and let ${\mathcal F}$ be a family of graphs. A
subgraph $J$ of $G$ is ${\mathcal F}$-saturated if no member of ${\mathcal F}$
is a subgraph of $J$, but for any edge $e$ in $E(G)-E(J)$, some element of
${\mathcal F}$ is a subgraph of $J+e$. We let $\text{ex}({\mathcal F},G)$ and
$\text{sat}({\mathcal F},G)$ denote the maximum and minimum size of an
${\mathcal F}$-saturated subgraph of $G$, respectively. If no element of
${\mathcal F}$ is a subgraph of $G$, then $\text{sat}({\mathcal F},G) =
\text{ex}({\mathcal F}, G) = |E(G)|$.
  In this paper, for $k\ge 3$ and $n\ge 100$ we determine
$\text{sat}(K_3,K_k^n)$, where $K_k^n$ is the complete balanced $k$-partite
graph with partite sets of size $n$. We also give several families of
constructions of $K_t$-saturated subgraphs of $K_k^n$ for $t\ge 4$. Our results
and constructions provide an informative contrast to recent results on the
edge-density version of $\text{ex}(K_t,K_k^n)$ from [A. Bondy, J. Shen, S.
Thomass\'e, and C. Thomassen, Density conditions for triangles in multipartite
graphs, Combinatorica 26 (2006), 121--131] and [F. Pfender, Complete subgraphs
in multipartite graphs, Combinatorica 32 (2012), no. 4, 483--495].


Carbon Monoxide in Comet 9P/Tempel 1 before and after the Deep Impact
  Encounter

  One of the goals of the Hubble Space Telescope program to observe periodic
comet 9P/Tempel 1 in conjunction with NASA's Deep Impact mission was to study
the generation and evolution of the gaseous coma resulting from the impact. For
this purpose, the Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys was
used with the F140LP filter which is sensitive primarily to the ultraviolet
emission (>1400 A) from the CO Fourth Positive system. Following the impact we
detected an increase in brightness, which if all due to CO corresponds to 1.5 x
10^31 molecules or a mass of 6.6 x 10^5 kg, an amount that would normally be
produced by 7-10 hours of quiescent outgassing from the comet. This number is
less than or equal to 10% of the number of water molecules excavated, and
suggests that the volatile content of the material excavated by the impact did
not differ significantly from the surface or near sub-surface material
responsible for the quiescent outgassing of the comet.


Spontaneous CP Violation: Alternative to the Standard Model

  We propose a model of soft CP violation that evades the strong CP problem and
can describe observed CP violation in the neutral kaon sector, both direct and
indirect. Our model requires two ``duark'' mesons carrying quark number two
that have complex (CP-violating) bare masses and are coupled to quark pairs.
Aside from the existence of these potentially observable new particles with
masses of several hundred GeV, we predict a flat unitarity triangle ({\it
i.e.,} no observable direct CP violation in the $B$-meson sector) and a
possibly anomalous branching ratio for the decay mode $K^+\to \pi^++\bar{\nu}
\nu$.


Secretly Eccentric: The Giant Planet and Activity Cycle of GJ 328

  We announce the discovery of a ~2 Jupiter-mass planet in an eccentric 11-year
orbit around the K7/M0 dwarf GJ 328. Our result is based on 10 years' worth of
radial velocity (RV) data from the Hobby-Eberly and Harlan J. Smith telescopes
at McDonald Observatory, and from the Keck Telescope at Mauna Kea. Our analysis
of GJ 328's magnetic activity via the Na I D features reveals a long-period
stellar activity cycle, which creates an additional signal in the star's RV
curve with amplitude 6-10 m/s. After correcting for this stellar RV
contribution, we see that the orbit of the planet is more eccentric than
suggested by the raw RV data. GJ 328b is currently the most massive,
longest-period planet discovered around a low-mass dwarf.


Interaction of Cygnus A with its environment

  Cygnus A, the nearest truly powerful radio galaxy, resides at the centre of a
massive galaxy cluster. Chandra X-ray observations reveal its cocoon shocks,
radio lobe cavities and an X-ray jet, which are discussed here. It is argued
that X-ray emission from the outer regions of the cocoon shocks is nonthermal.
The X-ray jets are best interpreted as synchrotron emission, suggesting that
they, rather than the radio jets, are the path of energy flow from the nucleus
to the hotspots. In that case, a model shows that the jet flow is
non-relativistic and carries in excess of one solar mass per year.


Gamma-ray bursts: Restarting the Engine

  Recent gamma-ray burst observations have revealed late-time, highly energetic
events which deviate from the simplest expectations of the standard fireball
picture. Instead they may indicate that the central engine is active or
restarted at late times. We suggest that fragmentation and subsequent accretion
during the collapse of a rapidly rotating stellar core offers a natural
mechanism for this.


XMM-Newton view of MS0735+7421: the most energetic AGN outburst in a
  galaxy cluster

  We discuss the possible cosmological effects of powerful AGN outbursts in
galaxy clusters by starting from the results of an XMM-Newton observation of
the supercavity cluster MS0735+7421.


Partially ionized plasmas in electromagnetic fields

  The interaction of partially ionized plasmas with an electromagnetic field is
investigated using quantum statistical methods. A general statistical
expression for the current density of a plasma in an electromagnetic field is
presented and considered in the high field regime. Expressions for the
collisional absorption are derived and discussed. Further, partially ionized
plasmas are considered. Plasma Bloch equations for the description of
bound-free transitions are given and the absorption coefficient as well as rate
coefficients for multiphoton ionization are derived and numerical results are
presented.


Extending Continuum Models for Atom Probe Simulation

  This work describes extensions to existing level-set algorithms developed for
application within the field of Atom Probe Tomography (APT). We present a new
simulation tool for the simulation of 3D tomographic volumes, using advanced
level set methods. By combining narrow-band, B-Tree and particle-tracing
approaches from level-set methods, we demonstrate a practical tool for
simulating shape changes to APT samples under applied electrostatic fields, in
three dimensions. This work builds upon our previous studies by allowing for
non-axially symmetric solutions, with minimal loss in computational speed,
whilst retaining numerical accuracy.


Learning Multilingual Topics from Incomparable Corpus

  Multilingual topic models enable crosslingual tasks by extracting consistent
topics from multilingual corpora. Most models require parallel or comparable
training corpora, which limits their ability to generalize. In this paper, we
first demystify the knowledge transfer mechanism behind multilingual topic
models by defining an alternative but equivalent formulation. Based on this
analysis, we then relax the assumption of training data required by most
existing models, creating a model that only requires a dictionary for training.
Experiments show that our new method effectively learns coherent multilingual
topics from partially and fully incomparable corpora with limited amounts of
dictionary resources.


Understanding Crosslingual Transfer Mechanisms in Probabilistic Topic
  Modeling

  Probabilistic topic modeling is a popular choice as the first step of
crosslingual tasks to enable knowledge transfer and extract multilingual
features. While many multilingual topic models have been developed, their
assumptions on the training corpus are quite varied, and it is not clear how
well the models can be applied under various training conditions. In this
paper, we systematically study the knowledge transfer mechanisms behind
different multilingual topic models, and through a broad set of experiments
with four models on ten languages, we provide empirical insights that can
inform the selection and future development of multilingual topic models.


Laser remote magnetometry using mesospheric sodium

  We have demonstrated a remote magnetometer based on sodium atoms in the
Earth's mesosphere, at a 106-kilometer distance from our instrument. A
1.33-watt laser illuminated the atoms, and the magnetic field was inferred from
back-scattered light collected by a telescope with a 1.55-meter-diameter
aperture. The measurement sensitivity was 162 nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$. The value of
magnetic field inferred from our measurement is consistent with an estimate
based on the Earth's known field shape to within a fraction of a percent.
Projected improvements in optics could lead to sensitivity of 20
nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$, and the use of advanced lasers or a large telescope could
approach 1-nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ sensitivity. All experimental and theoretical
sensitivity values are based on a 60$^\circ$ angle between the laser beam axis
and the magnetic field vector; at the optimal 90$^\circ$ angle sensitivity
would be improved by about a factor of two.


The Dependence of Halo Mass on Galaxy Size at Fixed Stellar Mass Using
  Weak Lensing

  Stellar mass has been shown to correlate with halo mass, with non-negligible
scatter. The stellar mass-size and luminosity-size relationships of galaxies
also show significant scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. It is
possible that, at fixed stellar mass and galaxy colour, the halo mass is
correlated with galaxy size. Galaxy-galaxy lensing allows us to measure the
mean masses of dark matter haloes for stacked samples of galaxies. We extend
the analysis of the galaxies in the CFHTLenS catalogue by fitting single
S\'{e}rsic surface brightness profiles to the lens galaxies in order to recover
half-light radius values, allowing us to determine halo masses for lenses
according to their size. Comparing our halo masses and sizes to baselines for
that stellar mass yields a differential measurement of the halo mass-galaxy
size relationship at fixed stellar mass, defined as $M_{h}(M_{*}) \propto
r_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\eta}(M_{*})$. We find that on average, our lens galaxies
have an $\eta = 0.42\pm0.12$, i.e. larger galaxies live in more massive dark
matter haloes. The $\eta$ is strongest for high mass luminous red galaxies
(LRGs). Investigation of this relationship in hydrodynamical simulations
suggests that, at a fixed $M_{*}$, satellite galaxies have a larger $\eta$ and
greater scatter in the $M_{\mathrm{h}}$ and $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ relationship
compared to central galaxies.


Observation of X-ray variability in the BL Lac object 1ES1959+65

  This paper reports X-ray spectral observations of a relatively nearby z =
0.048 BL Lacertae (BL Lac) object 1ES1959+650, which is a potential TeV
emitter. The observations include 31 short pointings made by the Unconventional
Stellar Aspect (USA) Experiment on board the Advanced Research and Global
Observation Satellite (ARGOS), and 17 pointings by the PCA on board the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Most of these observations were spaced by less
than 1 day. \es was detected by the ARGOS USA detector in the range 1-16 keV,
and by the PCA in the 2-16 keV range but at different times. During the closely
spaced RXTE observations beginning on 2000 July 28, an ending of one flare and
a start of another are visible, associated with spectral changes, where the
photon index Gamma ranges between ~ 1.4 and 1.7, and the spectrum is harder
when the source is brighter. This implies that 1ES1959 is an XBL-type blazar,
with the X-ray emission likely to originate via the synchrotron process. The
USA observations reveal another flare that peaked on 2000 November 14 and
doubled the flux within a few days, again associated with spectral changes of
the same form. The spectral variability correlated with the flux and timing
characteristics of this object that are similar to those of other nearby BL
Lacs, and suggest relativistic beaming with a Doppler factor delta > 1.6 and
magnetic fields of the order of a few mG. We also suggest that the steady
component of the X-ray emission -- present in this object as well as in other
XBLs -- may be due to the large-scale relativistic jet (such as measured by
Chandra in many radio-loud AGN), but pointing very closely to our line of
sight.


The First FIRST Gravitationally Lensed Quasar: FBQ 0951+2635

  The V=16.9 quasar FBQ 0951+2635 at redshift z=1.24 appears double on CCD
exposures taken in subarcsecond seeing. The two objects are separated by 1.1"
and differ in brightness by 0.9 mag. VLA observations show the radio source to
be double with the same separation and position angle. Spectra taken with the
Keck II telescope show the two components to have nearly identical emission
line spectra, but with somewhat different absorption line systems. Subtraction
of two stellar point spread functions from the pair of components consistently
leaves a residual object. Depending upon whether this third object is extended
or a point source it may be as much as 1/10 or as little as 1/100 as bright as
the brighter QSO component. The observations leave no doubt that the 2 brighter
objects are gravitationally lensed images of the same quasar. The third object
might be either the lensing galaxy or a third image of the quasar, but both
interpretations have serious shortcomings.


First scattered light images of debris disks around HD 53143 and HD
  139664

  We present the first scattered light images of debris disks around a K star
(HD 53143) and an F star (HD 139664) using the coronagraphic mode of the
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). With
ages 0.3 - 1 Gyr, these are among the oldest optically detected debris disks.
HD 53143, viewed ~45 degrees from edge-on, does not show radial variation in
disk structure and has width >55 AU. HD 139664 is seen close to edge-on and has
belt-like morphology with a dust peak 83 AU from the star and a distinct outer
boundary at 109 AU. We discuss evidence for significant diversity in the radial
architecture of debris disks that appears unconnected to stellar spectral type
or age. HD 139664 and possibly the solar system belong in a category of narrow
belts 20-30 AU wide. HD 53143 represents a class of wide disk architecture with
characteristic width >50 AU.


Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 with Alice/Rosetta during
  the Deep Impact Encounter

  We report on spectroscopic observations of periodic comet 9P/Tempel 1 by the
Alice ultraviolet spectrograph on the Rosetta spacecraft in conjunction with
NASA's Deep Impact mission. Our objectives were to measure an increase in
atomic and molecular emissions produced by the excavation of volatile
sub-surface material. We unambiguously detected atomic oxygen emission from the
quiescent coma but no enhancement at the 10% (1-sigma) level following the
impact. We derive a quiescent water production rate of 9 x 10^27 molecules per
second with an estimated uncertainty of 30%. Our upper limits to the volatiles
produced by the impact are consistent with other estimates.


Serpens Cluster B and VV Ser Observed With High Spatial Resolution at
  70, 160, and 350um

  We report on diffraction-limited observations in the far-infrared and sub-
millimeter of the Cluster B region of Serpens (G3-G6 Cluster) and of the Herbig
Be star to the south, VV Ser. The observations were made with the Spitzer MIPS
instrument in fine-scale mode at 70um, in normal mapping mode at 160um (VV Ser
only), and the CSO SHARC-II camera at 350um (Cluster B only). We use these data
to define the spectral energy distributions of the tightly grouped members of
Cluster B, many of whose SEDs peak in the far-infrared. We compare our results
to those of the c2d survey of Serpens and to published models for the
far-infrared emission from VV Ser. We find that values of Lbol and Tbol
calculated with our new photometry show only modest changes from previous
values, and that most source SED classifications remain unchanged.


Two-Dimensional Arrays of RF Ion Traps with Addressable Interactions

  We describe the advantages of 2-dimensional, addressable arrays of spherical
Paul traps. They would provide for the ability to address and tailor the
interaction strengths of trapped objects in 2D and could establish a valuable
new tool for quantum information processing. Simulations of trapping ions are
compared to first tests using printed circuit board trap arrays loaded with
dust particles. Pair-wise interactions in the array are addressed by means of
an adjustable radio-frequency (RF) electrode shared between trapping sites. By
attenuating this RF electrode potential, neighboring pairs of trapped objects
have their interaction strength increase and are moved closer to one another.
In the limit of the adjustable electrode being held at RF ground, the two
formerly spherical traps are merged into one linear Paul trap.


Surface Roughness Dominated Pinning Mechanism of Magnetic Vortices in
  Soft Ferromagnetic Films

  Although pinning of domain walls in ferromagnets is ubiquitous, the absence
of an appropriate characterization tool has limited the ability to correlate
the physical and magnetic microstructures of ferromagnetic films with specific
pinning mechanisms. Here, we show that the pinning of a magnetic vortex, the
simplest possible domain structure in soft ferromagnets, is strongly correlated
with surface roughness, and we make a quantitative comparison of the pinning
energy and spatial range in films of various thickness. The results demonstrate
that thickness fluctuations on the lateral length scale of the vortex core
diameter, i.e. an effective roughness at a specific length scale, provides the
dominant pinning mechanism. We argue that this mechanism will be important in
virtually any soft ferromagnetic film.


Operator-Like Wavelet Bases of $L_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$

  The connection between derivative operators and wavelets is well known. Here
we generalize the concept by constructing multiresolution approximations and
wavelet basis functions that act like Fourier multiplier operators. This
construction follows from a stochastic model: signals are tempered
distributions such that the application of a whitening (differential) operator
results in a realization of a sparse white noise. Using wavelets constructed
from these operators, the sparsity of the white noise can be inherited by the
wavelet coefficients. In this paper, we specify such wavelets in full
generality and determine their properties in terms of the underlying operator.


Decay properties of Riesz transforms and steerable wavelets

  The Riesz transform is a natural multi-dimensional extension of the Hilbert
transform, and it has been the object of study for many years due to its nice
mathematical properties. More recently, the Riesz transform and its variants
have been used to construct complex wavelets and steerable wavelet frames in
higher dimensions. The flip side of this approach, however, is that the Riesz
transform of a wavelet often has slow decay. One can nevertheless overcome this
problem by requiring the original wavelet to have sufficient smoothness, decay,
and vanishing moments. In this paper, we derive necessary conditions in terms
of these three properties that guarantee the decay of the Riesz transform and
its variants, and as an application, we show how the decay of the popular
Simoncelli wavelets can be improved by appropriately modifying their Fourier
transforms. By applying the Riesz transform to these new wavelets, we obtain
steerable frames with rapid decay.


Non-destructive shadowgraph imaging of ultracold atoms

  An imaging system is presented that is capable of far-detuned non-destructive
imaging of a Bose-Einstein condensate with the signal proportional to the
second spatial derivative of the density. Whilst demonstrated with application
to $^{85}\text{Rb}$, the technique generalizes to other atomic species and is
shown to be capable of a signal to noise of ${\sim}25$ at $1$GHz detuning with
$100$ in-trap images showing no observable heating or atom loss. The technique
is also applied to the observation of individual trajectories of stochastic
dynamics inaccessible to single shot imaging. Coupled with a fast optical phase
lock loop, the system is capable of dynamically switching to resonant
absorption imaging during the experiment.


Cs$^{+}$ Solvated in Hydrogen - Evidence for Several Distinct Solvation
  Shells

  Helium nanodroplets are doped with cesium and molecular hydrogen and
subsequently ionized by electrons. Mass spectra reveal H$_x$Cs$^{+}$ ions that
contain as many as 130 hydrogen atoms. Two features in the spectra are
striking: First, the abundance of ions with an odd number of hydrogen atoms is
very low; the abundance of HCs$^+$ is only 1 % that of H$_2$Cs$^+$. The
dominance of even-numbered species is in stark contrast to previous studies of
pure or doped hydrogen cluster ions. Second, the abundance of (H$_2$)$_n$Cs$^+$
features anomalies at n = 8, 12, 32, 44, and 52. Guided by previous work on
ions solvated in hydrogen and helium we assign the anomalies at n = 12, 32, 44
to the formation of three concentric, solid-like solvation shells of
icosahedral symmetry around Cs$^+$. Preliminary density functional theory
calculations for n $\le$ 14 are reported as well.


Resonant electron attachment to mixed hydrogen/oxygen and
  deuterium/oxygen clusters

  Low energy electron attachment to mixed (H$_2$)$_x$/(O$_2$)$_y$ clusters and
their deuterated analogues has been investigated for the first time. These
experiments were carried out using liquid helium nanodroplets to form the
clusters, and the effect of the added electron was then monitored via mass
spectrometry. There are some important differences between electron attachment
to the pure clusters and to the mixed clusters. A particularly notable feature
is the formation of HO$_2$$^{-}$ and H$_2$O$^{-}$ ions from an electron-induced
chemical reaction between the two dopants. The chemistry leading to these
anions appears to be driven by electron resonances associated with H$_2$ rather
than O$_2$. The electron resonances for H$_2$ can lead to dissociative electron
attachment (DEA), just as for the free H$_2$ molecule. However, there is
evidence that the resonance in H$_2$ can also lead to rapid electron transfer
to O$_2$, which then induces DEA of the O$_2$. This kind of excitation transfer
has not, as far as we are aware, been reported previously


Dynamical Bonding Driving Mixed Valency in a Metal Boride

  Samarium hexaboride is an anomaly, having many exotic and seemingly mutually
incompatible properties. It was proposed to be a mixed-valent semiconductor,
and later - a topological Kondo insulator, and yet has a Fermi surface despite
being an insulator. We propose a new and unified understanding of SmB6 centered
on the hitherto unrecognized dynamical bonding effect: the coexistence of two
Sm-B bonding modes within SmB6, corresponding to different oxidation states of
the Sm. The mixed valency arises in SmB6 from thermal population of these
distinct minima enabled by motion of B. Our model simultaneously explains the
thermal valence fluctuations, appearance of magnetic Fermi surface, excess
entropy at low temperatures, pressure-induced phase transitions, and related
features in Raman spectra and their unexpected dependence on temperature and
boron isotope.


The dwarf galaxy population in Abell 2218

  We present results from a deep photometric study of the rich galaxy cluster
Abell 2218 (z=0.18) based on archival HST WFPC2 F606W images. These have been
used to derive the luminosity function to extremely faint limits
(M_{F606W}=-13.2 mag, mu_{0}=24.7 mag arcsec^{-2}) over a wide field of view
(1.3 h^{-2} Mpc^2). We find the faint-end slope of the luminosity function to
vary with environment within the cluster, going from alpha=-1.23\pm0.13 within
the projected central core of the cluster (100 < r < 300 h^{-1} kpc) to
alpha=-1.49\pm 0.06 outside this radius (300 < r < 750 h^{-1} kpc). We infer
that the core is 'dwarf depleted', and further quantify this by studying the
ratio of 'dwarf' to 'giant' galaxies and its dependency as a function of
cluster-centric radius and local galaxy density. We find that this ratio varies
strongly with both quantities, and that the dwarf galaxy population in A2218
has a more extended distribution than the giant galaxy population.


Regularized Ordinal Regression and the ordinalNet R Package

  Regularization techniques such as the lasso (Tibshirani 1996) and elastic net
(Zou and Hastie 2005) can be used to improve regression model coefficient
estimation and prediction accuracy, as well as to perform variable selection.
Ordinal regression models are widely used in applications where the use of
regularization could be beneficial; however, these models are not included in
many popular software packages for regularized regression. We propose a
coordinate descent algorithm to fit a broad class of ordinal regression models
with an elastic net penalty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each model in
this class generalizes to a more flexible form, for instance to accommodate
unordered categorical data. We introduce an elastic net penalty class that
applies to both model forms. Additionally, this penalty can be used to shrink a
non-ordinal model toward its ordinal counterpart. Finally, we introduce the R
package ordinalNet, which implements the algorithm for this model class.


Characterizing solute hydrogen and hydrides in pure and alloyed titanium
  at the atomic scale

  Ti has a high affinity for hydrogen and is a typical hydride formers.
Ti-hydride are brittle phases which probably cause premature failure of
Ti-alloys. Here, we used atom probe tomography and electron microscopy to
investigate the hydrogen distribution in a set of specimens of commercially
pure Ti, model and commercial Ti-alloys. Although likely partly introduced
during specimen preparation with the focused-ion beam, we show formation of
Ti-hydrides along {\alpha} grain boundaries and {\alpha}/\b{eta} phase
boundaries in commercial pure Ti and {\alpha}+\b{eta} binary model alloys. No
hydrides are observed in the {\alpha} phase in alloys with Al addition or
quenched-in Mo supersaturation.


Quantifying Temperature-dependent Substrate Loss in GaN-on-Si RF
  Technology

  Intrinsic limits to temperature-dependent substrate loss for GaN-on-Si
technology, due to the change in resistivity of the substrate with temperature,
are evaluated using an experimentally validated device simulation framework.
Effect of room temperature substrate resistivity on temperature-dependent CPW
line loss at various operating frequency bands are then presented. CPW lines
for GaN-on-high resistivity Si are shown to have a pronounced
temperature-dependence for temperatures above 150{\deg}C and have lower
substrate losses for frequencies above the X-band. On the other hand,
GaN-on-low resistivity Si is shown to be more temperature-insensitive and have
lower substrate losses than even HR-Si for lower operating frequencies. The
effect of various CPW geometries on substrate loss is also presented to
generalize the discussion. These results are expected to act as a benchmark for
temperature dependent substrate loss in GaN-on-Si RF technology.


Eclipse Timings of the Transient Low Mass X-ray Binary EXO0748-676. IV.
  The Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer Eclipses

  We report our complete database of X-ray eclipse timings of the low mass
X-ray binary EXO0748-676 observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
satellite. As of this writing we have accumulated 443 full X-ray eclipses, 392
of which have been observed with the Proportional Counter Array on RXTE. These
include both observations where an eclipse was specifically targeted and those
eclipses found in the RXTE data archive. Eclipse cycle count has been
maintained since the discovery of the EXO0748-676 system in February 1985. We
describe our observing and analysis techniques for each eclipse and describe
improvements we have made since the last compilation by Wolff et al. (2002).
The principal result of this paper is the database containing the timing
results from a seven-parameter fit to the X-ray light curve for each observed
eclipse along with the associated errors in the fitted parameters. Based on the
standard O-C analysis, EXO0748-676 has undergone four distinct orbital period
epochs since its discovery. In addition, EXO0748-676 shows small-scale events
in the O-C curve that are likely due to short-lived changes in the secondary
star.


Overview of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument

  The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is under construction to
measure the expansion history of the Universe using the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation technique. The spectra of 35 million galaxies and quasars over
14000 square degrees will be measured during the life of the experiment. A new
prime focus corrector for the KPNO Mayall telescope will deliver light to 5000
fiber optic positioners. The fibers in turn feed ten broad-band spectrographs.
We present an overview of the instrumentation, the main technical requirements
and challenges, and the current status of the project.


Hot DB White Dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

  We present ugriz photometry and optical spectroscopy for 28 DB and DO white
dwarfs with temperatures between 28,000K and 45,000K. About 10 of these are
particularly well-observed; the remainder are candidates. These are the hottest
DB stars yet found, and they populate the "DB gap" between the hotter DO stars
and the familiar DB stars cooler than 30,000K. Nevertheless, after carefully
matching the survey volumes, we find that the ratio of DA stars to DB/DO stars
is a factor of 2.5 larger at 30,000 K than at 20,000 K, suggesting that the "DB
gap" is indeed deficient and that some kind of atmospheric transformation takes
place in roughly 10% of DA stars as they cool from 30,000 K to 20,000 K.


The McDonald Observatory Planet Search: New Long-Period Giant Planets,
  and Two Interacting Jupiters in the HD 155358 System

  We present high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations of four
solar-type (F7-G5) stars - HD 79498, HD 155358, HD 197037, and HD 220773 -
taken as part of the McDonald Observatory Planet Search Program. For each of
these stars, we see evidence of Keplerian motion caused by the presence of one
or more gas giant planets in long-period orbits. We derive orbital parameters
for each system, and note the properties (composition, activity, etc.) of the
host stars. While we have previously announced the two-gas-giant HD 155358
system, we now report a shorter period for planet c. This new period is
consistent with the planets being trapped in mutual 2:1 mean-motion resonance.
We therefore perform an in-depth stability analysis, placing additional
constraints on the orbital parameters of the planets. These results demonstrate
the excellent long-term RV stability of the spectrometers on both the Harlan J.
Smith 2.7 m telescope and the Hobby-Eberly telescope.


A Strong X-Ray Burst from the Low Mass X-Ray Binary EXO0748-676

  We have observed an unusually strong X-ray burst as a part of our regular
eclipse timing observations of the low mass binary system EXO0748-676. The
burst peak flux was 5.2x10^-8 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, approximately five times the
normal peak X-ray burst flux observed from this source by RXTE. Spectral fits
to the data strongly suggest that photospheric radius expansion occurred during
the burst. In this Letter we examine the properties of this X-ray burst, which
is the first example of a radius expansion burst from EXO0748-676 observed by
RXTE. We find no evidence for coherent burst oscillations. Assuming that the
peak burst luminosity is the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4 solar mass neutron
star we derive a distance to EXO0748-676 of 7.7 kpc for a helium-dominated
burst photosphere and 5.9 kpc for a hydrogen-dominated burst photosphere.


Designing Attractive Models via Automated Identification of Chaotic and
  Oscillatory Dynamical Regimes

  Chaos and oscillations continue to capture the interest of both the
scientific and public domains. Yet despite the importance of these qualitative
features, most attempts at constructing mathematical models of such phenomena
have taken an indirect, quantitative approach, e.g. by fitting models to a
finite number of data-points. Here we develop a qualitative inference framework
that allows us to both reverse engineer and design systems exhibiting these and
other dynamical behaviours by directly specifying the desired characteristics
of the underlying dynamical attractor. This change in perspective from
quantitative to qualitative dynamics, provides fundamental and new insights
into the properties of dynamical systems.


Decontaminating Swift UVOT Grism Observations of Transient Sources

  We present a new technique of decontaminating Swift UVOT grism spectra for
transient objects. We describe the template image requirements and image
processing steps necessary to successfully implement the empirical
decontamination technique. We demonstrate the accuracy of the flux and
wavelength calibrations for decontaminated spectra by comparing a spectrum of
SN 2011fe with a well-calibrated, long-slit ultraviolet spectrum from the
Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. We also show how
the decontamination removes spurious emission lines from spectra of iPTF14bdn
which otherwise could be misinterpreted as coming from the supernova. The
software which implements this technique is briefly discussed and is made
available to the community.


A Case Study: Novel Group Interactions through Introductory
  Computational Physics

  With the advent of high-level programming languages capable of quickly
rendering three-dimensional simulations, the inclusion of computers as a
learning tool in the classroom has become more prevalent. Although work has
begun to study the patterns seen in implementing and assessing computation in
introductory physics, more insight is needed to understand the observed effects
of blending computation with physics in a group setting. In a newly adopted
format of introductory calculus-based mechanics, called Projects and Practices
in Physics, groups of students work on short modeling projects -- which make
use of a novel inquiry-based approach -- to develop their understanding of both
physics content and practice. Preliminary analyses of observational data of
groups engaging with computation, coupled with synchronized computer
screencast, has revealed a unique group interaction afforded by the practices
specific to computational physics -- problem debugging.


Analytical formulation for the bend-loss in single-ring hollow-core
  photonic crystal fibers

  Understanding bend-loss in single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fibers is
becoming of increasing importance as the fibers enter practical applications.
While purely numerical approaches are useful, there is a need for a simpler
analytical formalism that provides physical insight and can be directly used in
the design of PCFs with low bend-loss. We show theoretically and experimentally
that a wavelength-dependent critical bend radius exists below which the
bend-loss reaches a maximum, and that this can be calculated from the
structural parameters of a fiber using a simple analytical formula. This allows
straightforward design of single-ring PCFs that are bend-insensitive for
specified ranges of bend radius and wavelength. It also can be used to derive
an expression for the bend radius that yields optimal higher-order mode
suppression for a given fiber structure.


Serendipity and the SDSS: Discovery of the Largest Known Planetary
  Nebula on the Sky

  Investigation of spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey reveals the
presence of a region of ionized gas of >2 degrees diameter centered
approximately at alpha = 10^h 37^m delta = -00^o 18' (J2000) (Galactic
coordinates l=248, b=+48). [OIII] 4959,5007 emission is particularly strong and
emission from H-alpha and [NII] 6548,6583 is also detectable over a substantial
area on the sky. The combination of emission line ratios, the close to zero
heliocentric radial velocity and the morphology of the structure are consistent
with an identification as a very nearby planetary nebula. The proximity of the
hot, DO white dwarf PG1034+001 further strengthens this interpretation. The
object is: i) the largest planetary nebula on the sky, ii) certainly closer
than any planetary nebula other than Sh 2--216, iii) the first to be
unambiguously associated with a DO white dwarf. A parallax distance for
PG1034+001 would establish whether the structure is in fact the closest, and
one of the physically largest, planetary nebula known.
