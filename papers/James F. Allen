On the tails of the limiting QuickSort density

  We give upper and lower asymptotic bounds for the left tail and for the righttail of the continuous limiting QuickSort density f that are nearly matching ineach tail. The bounds strengthen results from a paper of Svante Janson (2015)concerning the corresponding distribution function F. Furthermore, we obtainsimilar bounds on absolute values of derivatives of f of each order.

Smoothness and decay properties of the limiting Quicksort density  function

  Using Fourier analysis, we prove that the limiting distribution of thestandardized random number of comparisons used by Quicksort to sort an array ofn numbers has an everywhere positive and infinitely differentiable density f,and that each derivative f^{(k)} enjoys superpolynomial decay at plus and minusinfinity. In particular, each f^{(k)} is bounded. Our method is sufficientlycomputational to prove, for example, that f is bounded by 16.

Monodromy for some rank two Galois representations over CM fields

  We investigate local-global compatibility for cuspidal automorphicrepresentations $\pi$ for GL(2) over CM fields that are regular algebraic ofweight $0$. We prove that for a Dirichlet density one set of primes $l$ and any$\iota : \overline{\mathbf{Q}}_l \cong \mathbf{C}$, the $l$-adic Galoisrepresentation attached to $\pi$ and $\iota$ has nontrivial monodromy at any $v\nmid l$ in $F$ at which $\pi$ is special.

QuickSort: Improved right-tail asymptotics for the limiting  distribution, and large deviations

  We substantially refine asymptotic logarithmic upper bounds produced bySvante Janson (2015) on the right tail of the limiting QuickSort distributionfunction $F$ and by Fill and Hung (2018) on the right tails of thecorresponding density $f$ and of the absolute derivatives of $f$ of each order.For example, we establish an upper bound on $\log[1 - F(x)]$ that matchesconjectured asymptotics of Knessl and Szpankowski (1999) through terms of order$(\log x)^2$; the corresponding order for the Janson (2015) bound is the leadorder, $x \log x$.  Using the refined asymptotic bounds on $F$, we derive right-tail largedeviation (LD) results for the distribution of the number of comparisonsrequired by QuickSort that substantially sharpen the two-sided LD results ofMcDiarmid and Hayward (1996).

Potential automorphy over CM fields

  Let $F$ be a CM number field. We prove modularity lifting theorems forregular $n$-dimensional Galois representations over $F$ without anyself-duality condition. We deduce that all elliptic curves $E$ over $F$ arepotentially modular, and furthermore satisfy the Sato--Tate conjecture. As anapplication of a different sort, we also prove the Ramanujan Conjecture forweight zero cuspidal automorphic representations for$\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{A}_F)$.

Discourse Obligations in Dialogue Processing

  We show that in modeling social interaction, particularly dialogue, theattitude of obligation can be a useful adjunct to the popularly consideredattitudes of belief, goal, and intention and their mutual and sharedcounterparts. In particular, we show how discourse obligations can be used toaccount in a natural manner for the connection between a question and itsanswer in dialogue and how obligations can be used along with other parts ofthe discourse context to extend the coverage of a dialogue system.

Incorporating POS Tagging into Language Modeling

  Language models for speech recognition tend to concentrate solely onrecognizing the words that were spoken. In this paper, we redefine the speechrecognition problem so that its goal is to find both the best sequence of wordsand their syntactic role (part-of-speech) in the utterance. This is a necessaryfirst step towards tightening the interaction between speech recognition andnatural language understanding.

Partitions with Distinct Multiplicities of Parts: On An "Unsolved  Problem" Posed By Herbert Wilf

  Wilf's Sixth Unsolved Problem asks for any interesting properties of the setof partitions of integers for which the (nonzero) multiplicities of the partsare all different. We refer to these as \emph{Wilf partitions}. Using $f(n)$ todenote the number of Wilf partitions, we establish lead-order asymptotics for$\ln{f(n)}$.

Metabolic Rate Calibrates the Molecular Clock: Reconciling Molecular and  Fossil Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence

  Observations that rates of molecular evolution vary widely within and amonglineages have cast doubts upon the existence of a single molecular clock.Differences in the timing of evolutionary events estimated from genetic andfossil evidence have raised further questions about the existence of molecularclocks and their use. Here we present a model of nucleotide substitution thatcombines new theory on metabolic rate with the now classic neutral theory ofmolecular evolution. The model quantitatively predicts rate heterogeneity, andreconciles differences in molecular- and fossil-estimated dates of evolutionaryevents. Model predictions are supported by extensive data from mitochondrialand nuclear genomes. By accounting for the effects of body size and temperatureon metabolic rate, a single molecular clock explains heterogeneity in rates ofnucleotide substitution in different genes, taxa, and thermal environments.This model suggests that there is indeed a general molecular clock, asoriginally proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling, but that it ticks at a constantsubstitution rate per unit mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unittime. More generally, the model suggests that body size and temperature combineto control the overall rate of evolution through their effects on metabolism.

Classification and analysis of emission-line galaxies using mean field  independent component analysis

  We present an analysis of the optical spectra of narrow emission-linegalaxies, based on mean field independent component analysis (MFICA). Samplesof galaxies were drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and used togenerate compact sets of `continuum' and `emission-line' component spectra.These components can be linearly combined to reconstruct the observed spectraof a wider sample of galaxies. Only 10 components - five continuum and fiveemission line - are required to produce accurate reconstructions of essentiallyall narrow emission-line galaxies; the median absolute deviations of thereconstructed emission-line fluxes, given the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ofthe observed spectra, are 1.2-1.8 sigma for the strong lines. After applyingthe MFICA components to a large sample of SDSS galaxies we identify the regionsof parameter space that correspond to pure star formation and pure activegalactic nucleus (AGN) emission-line spectra, and produce high S/Nreconstructions of these spectra.  The physical properties of the pure star formation and pure AGN spectra areinvestigated by means of a series of photoionization models, exploiting thefaint emission lines that can be measured in the reconstructions. We are ableto recreate the emission line strengths of the most extreme AGN case byassuming the central engine illuminates a large number of individual cloudswith radial distance and density distributions, f(r) ~ r^gamma and g(n) ~n^beta, respectively. The best fit is obtained with gamma = -0.75 and beta =-1.4. From the reconstructed star formation spectra we are able to estimate thestarburst ages. These preliminary investigations serve to demonstrate thesuccess of the MFICA-based technique in identifying distinct emission sources,and its potential as a tool for the detailed analysis of the physicalproperties of galaxies in large-scale surveys.

A Robust System for Natural Spoken Dialogue

  This paper describes a system that leads us to believe in the feasibility ofconstructing natural spoken dialogue systems in task-oriented domains. Itspecifically addresses the issue of robust interpretation of speech in thepresence of recognition errors. Robustness is achieved by a combination ofstatistical error post-correction, syntactically- and semantically-drivenrobust parsing, and extensive use of the dialogue context. We present anevaluation of the system using time-to-completion and the quality of the finalsolution that suggests that most native speakers of English can use the systemsuccessfully with virtually no training.

Intonational Boundaries, Speech Repairs and Discourse Markers: Modeling  Spoken Dialog

  To understand a speaker's turn of a conversation, one needs to segment itinto intonational phrases, clean up any speech repairs that might haveoccurred, and identify discourse markers. In this paper, we argue that theseproblems must be resolved together, and that they must be resolved early in theprocessing stream. We put forward a statistical language model that resolvesthese problems, does POS tagging, and can be used as the language model of aspeech recognizer. We find that by accounting for the interactions betweenthese tasks that the performance on each task improves, as does POS tagging andperplexity.

Identifying Discourse Markers in Spoken Dialog

  In this paper, we present a method for identifying discourse marker usage inspontaneous speech based on machine learning. Discourse markers are denoted byspecial POS tags, and thus the process of POS tagging can be used to identifydiscourse markers. By incorporating POS tagging into language modeling,discourse markers can be identified during speech recognition, in which thetimeliness of the information can be used to help predict the following words.We contrast this approach with an alternative machine learning approachproposed by Litman (1996). This paper also argues that discourse markers can beused to help the hearer predict the role that the upcoming utterance plays inthe dialog. Thus discourse markers should provide valuable evidence forautomatic dialog act prediction.

A Language for Planning with Statistics

  When a planner must decide whether it has enough evidence to make a decisionbased on probability, it faces the sample size problem. Current planners usingprobabilities need not deal with this problem because they do not generatetheir probabilities from observations. This paper presents an event basedlanguage in which the planner's probabilities are calculated from the binomialrandom variable generated by the observed ratio of one type of event toanother. Such probabilities are subject to error, so the planner mustintrospect about their validity. Inferences about the probability of theseevents can be made using statistics. Inferences about the validity of theapproximations can be made using interval estimation. Interval estimationallows the planner to avoid making choices that are only weakly supported bythe planner's evidence.

The size distribution of Near Earth Objects larger than 10 meters

  We analyzed data from the first year of a survey for Near Earth Objects(NEOs) that we are carrying out with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the4-meter Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Weimplanted synthetic NEOs into the data stream to derive our nightly detectionefficiency as a function of magnitude and rate of motion. Using these measuredefficiencies and the Solar System absolute magnitudes derived by the MinorPlanet Center for the 1377 measurements of 235 unique NEOs detected, wedirectly derive, for the first time from a single observational data set, theNEO size distribution from 1 km down to 10 meters. We find that there are10^6.6 NEOs larger than 10 meters. This result implies a factor of ten fewersmall NEOs than some previous results, though our derived size distribution isin good agreement with several other estimates.

Spitzer Imaging of the Nearby Rich Young Cluster, Cep OB3b

  We map the full extent of a rich massive young cluster in the Cep OB3bassociation with the IRAC and MIPS instruments aboard the {\it Spitzer} SpaceTelescope and the ACIS instrument aboard the $\it{Chandra}$ X-Ray Observatory.At 700 pc, it is revealed to be the second nearest large ($>1000$ member),young ($< 5$ Myr) cluster known. In contrast to the nearest large cluster, theOrion Nebula Cluster, Cep OB3b is only lightly obscured and is mostly locatedin a large cavity carved out of the surrounding molecular cloud. Our infraredand X-ray datasets, as well as visible photometry from the literature, are usedto take a census of the young stars in Cep OB3b. We find that the young starswithin the cluster are concentrated in two sub-clusters; an easternsub-cluster, near the Cep B molecular clump, and a western sub-cluster, nearthe Cep F molecular clump. Using our census of young stars, we examine thefraction of young stars with infrared excesses indicative of circumstellardisks. We create a map of the disk fraction throughout the cluster and findthat it is spatially variable. Due to these spatial variations, the twosub-clusters exhibit substantially different average disk fractions from eachother: $32% \pm 4%$ and $50% \pm 6%$. We discuss whether the discrepant diskfractions are due to the photodestruction of disks by the high mass members ofthe cluster or whether they result from differences in the ages of thesub-clusters. We conclude that the discrepant disk fractions are most likelydue to differences in the ages.

Localized Oscillatory Dissipation in Magnetopause Reconnection

  Data from the NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission are used toinvestigate asymmetric magnetic reconnection at the dayside boundary betweenthe Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind (the magnetopause).High-resolution measurements of plasmas, electric and magnetic fields, andwaves are used to identify highly localized (~15 electron Debye lengths)standing wave structures with large electric-field amplitudes (up to 100 mV/m).These wave structures are associated with spatially oscillatory dissipation,which appears as alternatingly positive and negative values of J dot E(dissipation). For small guide magnetic fields the wave structures occur in theelectron stagnation region at the magnetosphere edge of the EDR. For largerguide fields the structures also occur near the reconnection x-line. Thisdifference is explained in terms of channels for the out-of-plane current(agyrotropic electrons at the stagnation point and guide-field-alignedelectrons at the x-line).

Meeting the Cool Neighbors X: Ultracool dwarfs from the 2MASS All-Sky  Data Release

  Using data from the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalogue, we have extendedour census of nearby ultracool dwarfs to cover the full celestial sphere aboveGalactic latitute 15 degrees. Starting with an initial catalogue of 2,139,484sources, we have winnowed the sample to 467 candidate late-type M or L dwarfswithin 20 parsecs of the Sun. Fifty-four of those sources already havespectroscopic observations confirming them as late-type dwarfs. We presentoptical spectroscopy of 376 of the remaining 413 sources, and identify 44 asultracool dwarfs with spectroscopic distances less than 20 parsecs. Twenty-fiveof the 37 sources that lack optical data have near-infrared spectroscopy.Combining the present sample with our previous results and data from theliterature, we catalogue 94 L dwarf systems within 20 parsecs. We discuss thedistribution of activity, as measured by H-alpha emission, in thisvolume-limited sample. We have coupled the present ultracool catalogue withdata for stars in the northern 8-parsec sample and recent (incomplete)statistics for T dwarfs to provide a snapshot of the current 20-parsec censusas a function of spectral type.

The JCMT Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey VI: The distribution of gas and  star formation in M81

  We present a first complete 12 CO J=3-2 map of M81, observed as part of theNearby Galaxies Legacy Survey being carried out at the James Clerk MaxwellTelescope. We detect 9 regions of significant CO emission located at differentpositions within the spiral arms, and confirm that the global CO emission inthe galaxy is low. We combine these data with a new H-alpha map obtained usingthe Isaac Newton Telescope and archival HI, 24 microns and FUV images touncover a correlation between the molecular gas and star forming regions inM81. For the nine regions detected in CO J=3-2, we combine our CO J=3-2 datawith existing CO J=1-0 data to calculate line ratios. We find that the ratioJ=(3-2)/(1-0) is in agreement with the range of typical values found in theliterature (0.2-0.8). Making reasonable assumptions, this allows us toconstrain the hydrogen density to the range (10^3-10^4) cm^{-3}. We alsoestimated the amount of hydrogen produced in photo-dissociation regions nearthe locations where CO J=3-2 was detected.

Magnetospheric Multiscale Dayside Reconnection Electron Diffusion Region  Events

  We have used the high-resolution data of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)mission dayside phase to identify twenty-one previously unreported encounterswith the electron diffusion region (EDR), as evidenced by electron agyrotropy,ion jet reversals, and j dot E greater than 0. Three of the new EDR encounters,which occurred within a one-minute-long interval on November 23rd, 2016, areanalyzed in detail. These events, which resulted from a relatively low andoscillating magnetopause velocity, contained large electric fields (severaltens to hundreds of milliVolts per meter), crescent-shaped electron velocityphase space densities, large currents (greater than 2 microAmperes per squaremeter), and Ohmic heating of the plasma (near or exceeding 10 nanoWatts percubic meter). Because of the slow in-and-out motion of the magnetopause, two ofthese events show the unprecedented mixture of perpendicular and parallelcrescents, indicating the first breaking and reconnecting of solar wind andmagnetospheric field lines. An extended list of thirty-two EDR or near-EDRevents is also included, and demonstrates a wide variety of observed plasmabehavior inside and surrounding the reconnection site.

YSOVAR: the first sensitive, wide-area, mid-IR photometric monitoring of  the ONC

  We present initial results from time series imaging at infrared wavelengthsof 0.9 sq. degrees in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). During Fall 2009 weobtained 81 epochs of Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron data over 40 consecutive days.We extracted light curves with ~3% photometric accuracy for ~2000 ONC membersranging from several solar masses down to well below the hydrogen burning masslimit. For many of the stars, we also have time-series photometry obtained atoptical (Ic) and/or near-infrared (JKs) wavelengths. Our data set can be minedto determine stellar rotation periods, identify new pre-main-sequence (PMS)eclipsing binaries, search for new substellar Orion members, and help betterdetermine the frequency of circumstellar disks as a function of stellar mass inthe ONC. Our primary focus is the unique ability of 3.6 & 4.5 micronvariability information to improve our understanding of inner disk processesand structure in the Class I and II young stellar objects (YSOs). In thispaper, we provide a brief overview of the YSOVAR Orion data obtained in Fall2009, and we highlight our light curves for AA-Tau analogs - YSOs with narrowdips in flux, most probably due to disk density structures passing through ourline of sight. Detailed follow-up observations are needed in order to betterquantify the nature of the obscuring bodies and what this implies for thestructure of the inner disks of YSOs.

The Spitzer Survey of Interstellar Clouds in the Gould Belt. VI. The  Auriga-California Molecular Cloud observed with IRAC and MIPS

  We present observations of the Auriga-California Molecular Cloud (AMC) at3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, 70 and 160 micron observed with the IRAC and MIPSdetectors as part of the Spitzer Gould Belt Legacy Survey. The total mappedareas are 2.5 sq-deg with IRAC and 10.47 sq-deg with MIPS. This giant molecularcloud is one of two in the nearby Gould Belt of star-forming regions, the otherbeing the Orion A Molecular Cloud (OMC). We compare source counts, colors andmagnitudes in our observed region to a subset of the SWIRE data that wasprocessed through our pipeline. Using color-magnitude and color-color diagrams,we find evidence for a substantial population of 166 young stellar objects(YSOs) in the cloud, many of which were previously unknown. Most of thispopulation is concentrated around the LkHalpha 101 cluster and the filamentextending from it. We present a quantitative description of the degree ofclustering and discuss the fraction of YSOs in the region with disks relativeto an estimate of the diskless YSO population. Although the AMC is similar inmass, size and distance to the OMC, it is forming about 15 - 20 times fewerstars.

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Early Data Release

  We present the Early Data Release of the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integralfield spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. The SAMI Galaxy Survey is an ongoingintegral field spectroscopic survey of ~3400 low-redshift (z<0.12) galaxies,covering galaxies in the field and in groups within the Galaxy And MassAssembly (GAMA) survey regions, and a sample of galaxies in clusters.  In the Early Data Release, we publicly release the fully calibrated datacubesfor a representative selection of 107 galaxies drawn from the GAMA regions,along with information about these galaxies from the GAMA catalogues. Alldatacubes for the Early Data Release galaxies can be downloaded individually oras a set from the SAMI Galaxy Survey website.  In this paper we also assess the quality of the pipeline used to reduce theSAMI data, giving metrics that quantify its performance at all stages inprocessing the raw data into calibrated datacubes. The pipeline gives excellentresults throughout, with typical sky subtraction residuals in the continuum of0.9-1.2 per cent, a relative flux calibration uncertainty of 4.1 per cent(systematic) plus 4.3 per cent (statistical), and atmospheric dispersionremoved with an accuracy of 0."09, less than a fifth of a spaxel.

Near and Mid-IR Photometry of the Pleiades, and a New List of Substellar  Candidate Members

  We make use of new near and mid-IR photometry of the Pleiades cluster inorder to help identify proposed cluster members. We also use the new photometrywith previously published photometry to define the single-star main sequencelocus at the age of the Pleiades in a variety of color-magnitude planes.  The new near and mid-IR photometry extend effectively two magnitudes deeperthan the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a newset of candidate very low mass and sub-stellar mass members of the Pleiades inthe central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate membersfainter than Ks =14 (corresponding to 0.1 Mo). These candidate members shouldeventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made downto of order 0.04 solar masses.  We also use new IRAC data, in particular the images obtained at 8 um, inorder to comment briefly on interstellar dust in and near the Pleiades. Weconfirm, as expected, that -- with one exception -- a sample of low mass starsrecently identified as having 24 um excesses due to debris disks do not havesignificant excesses at IRAC wavelengths. However, evidence is also presentedthat several of the Pleiades high mass stars are found to be impacting withlocal condensations of the molecular cloud that is passing through the Pleiadesat the current epoch.

The Spitzer survey of interstellar clouds in the Gould Belt. II. The  Cepheus Flare observed with IRAC and MIPS

  We present Spitzer IRAC (~2 deg^2) and MIPS (~8 deg^2) observations of theCepheus Flare which is associated with the Gould Belt, at an approximatedistance of ~300 pc. Around 6500 sources are detected in all four IRAC bands,of which ~900 have MIPS 24 micron detections. We identify 133 YSO candidatesusing color-magnitude diagram techniques, a large number of the YSO candidatesare associated with the NGC 7023 reflection nebula. Cross identifications weremade with the Guide Star Catalog II and the IRAS Faint Source Catalog, andspectral energy distributions (SED) were constructed. SED modeling wasconducted to estimate the degree of infrared excess. It was found that a largemajority of disks were optically thick accreting disks, suggesting that therehas been little disk evolution in these sources. Nearest-neighbor clusteringanalysis identified four small protostellar groups (L1228, L1228N, L1251A, andL1251B) with 5-15 members each and the larger NGC 7023 association with 32 YSOmembers. The star formation efficiency for cores with clusters of protostarsand for those without clusters was found to be ~8% and ~1% respectively. Thecores L1155, L1241, and L1247 are confirmed to be starless down to ourluminosity limit of L_bol=0.06 L_sol.

The Spitzer c2d Survey of Weak-Line T Tauri Stars. III. The Transition  from Primordial Disks to Debris Disks

  We present 3.6 to 70 {\mu}m Spitzer photometry of 154 weak-line T Tauri stars(WTTS) in the Chamaeleon, Lupus, Ophiuchus and Taurus star formation regions,all of which are within 200 pc of the Sun. For a comparative study, we alsoinclude 33 classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) which are located in the same starforming regions. Spitzer sensitivities allow us to robustly detect thephotosphere in the IRAC bands (3.6 to 8 {\mu}m) and the 24 {\mu}m MIPS band. Inthe 70 {\mu}m MIPS band, we are able to detect dust emission brighter thanroughly 40 times the photosphere. These observations represent the mostsensitive WTTS survey in the mid to far infrared to date, and reveal thefrequency of outer disks (r = 3-50 AU) around WTTS. The 70 {\mu}m photometryfor half the c2d WTTS sample (the on-cloud objects), which were not included inthe earlier papers in this series, Padgett et al. (2006) and Cieza et al.(2007), are presented here for the first time. We find a disk frequency of 19%for on-cloud WTTS, but just 5% for off- cloud WTTS, similar to the valuereported in the earlier works. WTTS exhibit spectral energy distributions(SEDs) that are quite diverse, spanning the range from optically thick tooptically thin disks. Most disks become more tenuous than Ldisk/L* = 2 x 10^-3in 2 Myr, and more tenuous than Ldisk/L* = 5 x 10^-4 in 4 Myr.

Young Stellar Objects in the Gould Belt

  We present the full catalog of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) identified in the18 molecular clouds surveyed by the Spitzer Space Telescope "cores to disks"(c2d) and "Gould Belt" (GB) Legacy surveys. Using standard techniques developedby the c2d project, we identify 3239 candidate YSOs in the 18 clouds, 2966 ofwhich survive visual inspection and form our final catalog of YSOs in the GouldBelt. We compile extinction corrected SEDs for all 2966 YSOs and calculate andtabulate the infrared spectral index, bolometric luminosity, and bolometrictemperature for each object. We find that 326 (11%), 210 (7%), 1248 (42%), and1182 (40%) are classified as Class 0+I, Flat-spectrum, Class II, and Class III,respectively, and show that the Class III sample suffers from an overallcontamination rate by background AGB stars between 25% and 90%. Adoptingstandard assumptions, we derive durations of 0.40-0.78 Myr for Class 0+I YSOsand 0.26-0.50 Myr for Flat-spectrum YSOs, where the ranges encompassuncertainties in the adopted assumptions. Including information from(sub)millimeter wavelengths, one-third of the Class 0+I sample is classified asClass 0, leading to durations of 0.13-0.26 Myr (Class 0) and 0.27-0.52 Myr(Class I). We revisit infrared color-color diagrams used in the literature toclassify YSOs and propose minor revisions to classification boundaries in thesediagrams. Finally, we show that the bolometric temperature is a poordiscriminator between Class II and Class III YSOs.

Innovative Science

  Sir, We write as senior scientists about a problem vital to the scientificenterprise and prosperity. Nowadays, funding is a lengthy and complex business.First, universities themselves must approve all proposals for submission.Funding agencies then subject those that survive to peer review, a process bywhich a few researchers, usually acting anonymously, assess a proposal'schances that it will achieve its goals, is the best value for money, isrelevant to a national priority and will impact on a socio-economic problem.Only 25% of proposals received by the funding agencies are funded. Theseprotracted processes force researchers to exploit existing knowledge, severelydiscourage open-ended studies and are hugely time-consuming. They are also new:before 1970, few researchers wrote proposals. Now they are virtually mandatory.

ZFOURGE catalogue of AGN candidates: an enhancement of 160μm-derived  star-formation rates in active galaxies to $z$ = 3.2

  We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates within the FourStarGalaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) to determine the impact they have onstar-formation in their host galaxies. We first identify a population of radio,X-ray, and infrared-selected AGN by cross-matching the deep $K_{s}$-bandimaging of ZFOURGE with overlapping multi-wavelength data. From this, weconstruct a mass-complete (log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) $\ge$ 9.75), AGN luminositylimited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2 - 3.2. We compare the rest-frame U- V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of theAGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJdiagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescentgalaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using160{\mu}m Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star-formation rate ofAGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34$\pm$0.07 dex with respect to the controlsample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven byinfrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as muchas a factor of ~5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-rayAGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only amarginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings andpostulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderatinggalaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.

The SAMI galaxy survey: Galaxy Interactions and Kinematic Anomalies in  Abell 119

  Galaxy mergers are important events that can determine the fate of a galaxyby changing its morphology, star-formation activity and mass growth. Mergersystems have commonly been identified from their disturbed morphologies, and wenow can employ Integral Field Spectroscopy to detect and analyze the impact ofmergers on stellar kinematics as well. We visually classified galaxy morphologyusing deep images ($\mu_{\rm r} = 28\,\rm mag\,\, arcsec^{-2}$) taken by theBlanco 4-m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. In thispaper we investigate 63 bright ($M_{\rm r}<-19.3$) spectroscopically-selectedgalaxies in Abell 119; of which 53 are early type and 20 galaxies show adisturbed morphology by visual inspection. A misalignment between the majoraxes in the photometric image and the kinematic map is conspicuous inmorphologically-disturbed galaxies. Our sample is dominated by early-typegalaxies, yet it shows a surprisingly tight Tully-Fisher relation except forthe morphologically-disturbed galaxies which show large deviations. Three outof the eight slow rotators in our sample are morphology disturbed. Thevisually-selected morphologically-disturbed galaxies are generally moreasymmetric, visually as well as kinematically. Our findings suggest that galaxyinteractions, including mergers and perhaps fly-bys, play an important role indetermining the orientation and magnitude of galaxy's angular momentum.

GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS: The Morphologies of Ultraluminous Infrared  Galaxies at z~2

  Using deep 100-160 micron observations in GOODS-S from the GOODS-H survey,combined with HST/WFC3 NIR imaging from CANDELS, we present the firstmorphological analysis of a complete, FIR selected sample of 52 ULIRGs at z~2.We also make use of a comparison sample of galaxies without Herschel detectionsbut with the same z and magnitude distribution. Our visual classifications ofthese two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroidmorphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ULIRGs. The combination of diskand irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactionsand minor mergers could play an important role in ULIRGs at z~2. We comparethese fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range andfind that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with L_IR while thefraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.At comparable luminosities, the fraction of ULIRGs with various morphologicalclassifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. We investigate the position of theULIRGs, along with 70 LIRGs, on the specific star formation rate versusredshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (lie more than a factor of3 above the main sequence relation). The morphologies of starbursts aredominated by interacting and merging systems (50%). If irregular disks areincluded as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starburstsare involved in a merger or interaction at some level. Although the finalcoalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities ofULIRGs at z~2 as is the case locally, the large fraction of interactions at allstages and potential minor mergers suggest that the high star formation ratesof ULIRGs are still largely externally triggered at z~2.

Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Methods for Cluster Cosmology and  Application to the SDSS

  We perform the first blind analysis of cluster abundance data. Specifically,we derive cosmological constraints from the abundance and weak-lensing signalof \redmapper\ clusters of richness $\lambda\geq 20$ in the redshift range$z\in[0.1,0.3]$ as measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Wesimultaneously fit for cosmological parameters and the richness--mass relationof the clusters. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with massiveneutrinos, we find $S_8 \equiv\sigma_{8}(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.79^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. This value is bothconsistent and competitive with that derived from cluster catalogues selectedin different wavelengths. Our result is also consistent with the combinedprobes analyses by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Kilo-Degree Survey(KiDS), and with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies as measuredby \planck. We demonstrate that the cosmological posteriors are robust againstvariation of the richness--mass relation model and to systematics associatedwith the calibration of the selection function. In combination with BaryonAcoustic Oscillation (BAO) data and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) data, weconstrain the Hubble rate to be $h=0.66\pm 0.02$, independent of the CMB.Future work aimed at improving our understanding of the scatter of therichness--mass relation has the potential to significantly improve theprecision of our cosmological posteriors. The methods described in this workwere developed for use in the forthcoming analysis of cluster abundances in theDES. Our SDSS analysis constitutes the first part of a staged-unblindinganalysis of the full DES data set.

Phenotypic redshifts with self-organizing maps: A novel method to  characterize redshift distributions of source galaxies for weak lensing

  Wide-field imaging surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) rely oncoarse measurements of spectral energy distributions in a few filters toestimate the redshift distribution of source galaxies. In this regime, cosmicvariance, shot noise, and selection effects limit the attainable accuracy ofredshift calibration and thus of cosmological constraints. We present a newmethod to combine wide-field, few-filter measurements with catalogs from deepfields with additional filters and sufficiently low photometric noise to breakdegeneracies in photometric redshifts. The multi-band deep field is used as anintermediary between wide-field observations and accurate redshifts, greatlyreducing cosmic variance, shot noise, and selection effects. Our implementationof the method uses self-organizing maps to group galaxies into\textit{phenotypes} based on their observed fluxes, and is tested using a mockDES catalog created from $N$-body simulations. It yields a typical uncertaintyon the mean redshift in each of five tomographic bins for a simulation of theDES Year 3 weak-lensing tomographic analysis of $\sigma_{\Delta z} = 0.007$,which is a 60% improvement compared to the Year 1 analysis. Although theimplementation of the method is tailored to DES, its formalism can be appliedto other large photometric surveys with a similar observing strategy.

Young Stellar Object Variability (YSOVAR): Long Timescale Variations in  the Mid-Infrared

  The YSOVAR (Young Stellar Object VARiability) Spitzer Space Telescopeobserving program obtained the first extensive mid-infrared (3.6 & 4.5 um)time-series photometry of the Orion Nebula Cluster plus smaller footprints ineleven other star-forming cores (AFGL490, NGC1333, MonR2, GGD 12-15, NGC2264,L1688, Serpens Main, Serpens South, IRAS 20050+2720, IC1396A, and Ceph C).There are ~29,000 unique objects with light curves in either or both IRACchannels in the YSOVAR data set. We present the data collection and reductionfor the Spitzer and ancillary data, and define the "standard sample" on whichwe calculate statistics, consisting of fast cadence data, with epochs abouttwice per day for ~40d. We also define a "standard sample of members",consisting of all the IR-selected members and X-ray selected members. Wecharacterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectralenergy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in thefast cadence data--the Stetson index, a chi^2 fit to a flat light curve, andsignificant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescalespossible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzermission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign. The fraction of members in eachcluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of theratio of Class I/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with ahigher fraction of Class I objects also have a higher fraction of long-termvariables. For objects with a YSOVAR-determined period and a [3.6]-[8] color,we find that a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorterperiods to have an IR excess. We do not find any evidence for variability thatcauses [3.6]-[4.5] excesses to appear or vanish within our data; out of membersand field objects combined, at most 0.02% may have transient IR excesses.

Optical-SZE Scaling Relations for DES Optically Selected Clusters within  the SPT-SZ Survey

  We study the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signature in South PoleTelescope (SPT) data for an ensemble of 719 optically identified galaxyclusters selected from 124.6 deg$^2$ of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) scienceverification data, detecting a stacked SZE signal down to richness$\lambda\sim20$. The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps ofthe 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey at the positions of the DES clusters, and thedegeneracy between SZE observable and matched-filter size is broken by adoptingas priors SZE and optical mass-observable relations that are either calibratedusing SPT selected clusters or through the Arnaud et al. (2010, A10) X-rayanalysis. We measure the SPT signal to noise $\zeta$-$\lambda$, relation andtwo integrated Compton-$y$ $Y_\textrm{500}$-$\lambda$ relations for theDES-selected clusters and compare these to model expectations accounting forthe SZE-optical center offset distribution. For clusters with $\lambda > 80$,the two SPT calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements,while for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by afactor of $0.61 \pm 0.12$ compared to the prediction. For clusters at $20 <\lambda < 80$, the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of$\sim$0.20-0.80 (between 2.3 and 10~$\sigma$ significance) compared to theprediction, with the SPT calibrated scaling relations and larger $\lambda$clusters showing generally better agreement. We quantify the requiredcorrections to achieve consistency, showing that there is a richness dependentbias that can be explained by some combination of contamination of theobservables and biases in the estimated masses. We discuss possible physicaleffects, as contamination from line-of-sight projections or from point sources,larger offsets in the SZE-optical centering or larger scatter in the$\lambda$-mass relation at lower richnesses.

Pathway to the Square Kilometre Array - The German White Paper -

  The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is the most ambitious radio telescope everplanned. With a collecting area of about a square kilometre, the SKA will befar superior in sensitivity and observing speed to all current radiofacilities. The scientific capability promised by the SKA and its technologicalchallenges provide an ideal base for interdisciplinary research, technologytransfer, and collaboration between universities, research centres andindustry. The SKA in the radio regime and the European Extreme Large Telescope(E-ELT) in the optical band are on the roadmap of the European Strategy Forumfor Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) and have been recognised as the essentialfacilities for European research in astronomy.  This "White Paper" outlines the German science and R&D interests in the SKAproject and will provide the basis for future funding applications to secureGerman involvement in the Square Kilometre Array.

Standing Together for Reproducibility in Large-Scale Computing: Report  on reproducibility@XSEDE

  This is the final report on reproducibility@xsede, a one-day workshop held inconjunction with XSEDE14, the annual conference of the Extreme Science andEngineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). The workshop's discussion-orientedagenda focused on reproducibility in large-scale computational research. Twoimportant themes capture the spirit of the workshop submissions anddiscussions: (1) organizational stakeholders, especially supercomputer centers,are in a unique position to promote, enable, and support reproducible research;and (2) individual researchers should conduct each experiment as though someonewill replicate that experiment. Participants documented numerous issues,questions, technologies, practices, and potentially promising initiativesemerging from the discussion, but also highlighted four areas of particularinterest to XSEDE: (1) documentation and training that promotes reproducibleresearch; (2) system-level tools that provide build- and run-time informationat the level of the individual job; (3) the need to model best practices inresearch collaborations involving XSEDE staff; and (4) continued work ongateways and related technologies. In addition, an intriguing question emergedfrom the day's interactions: would there be value in establishing an annualaward for excellence in reproducible research?

The SAMI Galaxy Survey: extraplanar gas, galactic winds, and their  association with star formation history

  We investigate a sample of 40 local, main-sequence, edge-on disc galaxiesusing integral field spectroscopy with the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integralfield spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey to understand the link betweenproperties of the extraplanar gas and their host galaxies. The kinematicsproperties of the extraplanar gas, including velocity asymmetries and increaseddispersion, are used to differentiate galaxies hosting large-scale galacticwinds from those dominated by the extended diffuse ionized gas. We find ratherthat a spectrum of diffuse gas-dominated to wind dominated galaxies exist. Thewind-dominated galaxies span a wide range of star formation rates ($-1 \lesssim\log({\rm SFR/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}) \lesssim 0.5$) across the whole stellar massrange of the sample ($8.5 \lesssim \log({\rm M_{*}/M_{\odot}}) \lesssim 11$).The wind galaxies also span a wide range in SFR surface densities ($10^{-3}\textrm{--} 10^{-1.5}\rm~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$) that is much lower thanthe canonical threshold of $\rm0.1~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$. The windgalaxies on average have higher SFR surface densities and higher $\rmH\delta_A$ values than those without strong wind signatures. The enhanced $\rmH\delta_A$ indicates that bursts of star formation in the recent past arenecessary for driving large-scale galactic winds. We demonstrate with SloanDigital Sky Survey data that galaxies with high SFR surface density haveexperienced bursts of star formation in the recent past. Our results imply thatthe galactic winds revealed in our study are indeed driven by bursts of starformation, and thus probing star formation in the time domain is crucial forfinding and understanding galactic winds.

Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Weak Lensing Mass Calibration of  redMaPPer Galaxy Clusters

  We constrain the mass--richness scaling relation of redMaPPer galaxy clustersidentified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data using weak gravitationallensing. We split clusters into $4\times3$ bins of richness $\lambda$ andredshift $z$ for $\lambda\geq20$ and $0.2 \leq z \leq 0.65$ and measure themean masses of these bins using their stacked weak lensing signal. By modelingthe scaling relation as $\langle M_{\rm 200m}|\lambda,z\rangle = M_0(\lambda/40)^F ((1+z)/1.35)^G$, we constrain the normalization of the scalingrelation at the 5.0 per cent level as $M_0 = [3.081 \pm 0.075 ({\rm stat}) \pm0.133 ({\rm sys})] \cdot 10^{14}\ {\rm M}_\odot$ at $\lambda=40$ and $z=0.35$.The richness scaling index is constrained to be $F=1.356 \pm 0.051\ ({\rmstat})\pm 0.008\ ({\rm sys})$ and the redshift scaling index $G=-0.30\pm 0.30\({\rm stat})\pm 0.06\ ({\rm sys})$. These are the tightest measurements of thenormalization and richness scaling index made to date. We use a semi-analyticcovariance matrix to characterize the statistical errors in the recovered weaklensing profiles. Our analysis accounts for the following sources of systematicerror: shear and photometric redshift errors, cluster miscentering, clustermember dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties in the modelingof the halo--mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projectioneffects. We discuss prospects for reducing this systematic error budget, whichdominates the uncertainty on $M_0$. Our result is in excellent agreement with,but has significantly smaller uncertainties than, previous measurements in theliterature, and augurs well for the power of the DES cluster survey as a toolfor precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid andWFIRST.

The Astropy Problem

  The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org) is, in its own words, "a communityeffort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and fosterinteroperability between Python astronomy packages." For five years thisproject has been managed, written, and operated as a grassroots,self-organized, almost entirely volunteer effort while the software is used bythe majority of the astronomical community. Despite this, the project hasalways been and remains to this day effectively unfunded. Further, contributorsreceive little or no formal recognition for creating and supporting what is nowcritical software. This paper explores the problem in detail, outlines possiblesolutions to correct this, and presents a few suggestions on how to address thesustainability of general purpose astronomical software.

Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Cosmological Constraints from Galaxy  Clustering and Weak Lensing

  We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy clusteringand weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg$^2$ of $griz$ imaging data fromthe first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-pointfunctions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million sourcegalaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelationfunction of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) thegalaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and sourcegalaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we useindependent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation andvalidation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias,the bulk of the analysis was carried out while blind to the true results; wedescribe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed duringthis blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDMcosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for$\Lambda$CDM) or 7 (for $w$CDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrinomass density and including the 457 $\times$ 457 element analytic covariancematrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-pointfunctions, and from their combination obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.783^{+0.021}_{-0.025}$ and $\Omega_m =0.264^{+0.032}_{-0.019}$ for $\Lambda$CDM for $w$CDM, we find $S_8 =0.794^{+0.029}_{-0.027}$, $\Omega_m = 0.279^{+0.043}_{-0.022}$, and$w=-0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ at 68% CL. The precision of these DES Y1 resultsrivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowinga comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms.Although the DES Y1 best-fit values for $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ are lower than thecentral values from Planck ...

Overview of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys

  The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys are a combination of three public projects(the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey, and theMayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image approximately 14,000 deg^2of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three opticalbands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory andthe Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint issplit into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging isconducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure timesand pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearlyuniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering acatalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach toestimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry fromthe grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22micorons) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satelliteduring its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public datareleases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is alsoreleased with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveysproject.

Discovery of HI gas in a young radio galaxy at $z = 0.44$ using the  Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder

  We report the discovery of a new 21-cm HI absorption system usingcommissioning data from the Boolardy Engineering Test Array of the AustralianSquare Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Using the 711.5 - 1015.5 MHz band ofASKAP we were able to conduct a blind search for the 21-cm line in a continuousredshift range between $z = 0.4$ and 1.0, which has, until now, remainedlargely unexplored. The absorption line is detected at $z = 0.44$ towards theGHz-peaked spectrum radio source PKS B1740$-$517 and demonstrates ASKAP'sexcellent capability for performing a future wide-field survey for HIabsorption at these redshifts. Optical spectroscopy and imaging using theGemini-South telescope indicates that the HI gas is intrinsic to the hostgalaxy of the radio source. The narrow OIII emission lines show cleardouble-peaked structure, indicating either large-scale outflow or rotation ofthe ionized gas. Archival data from the \emph{XMM-Newton} satellite exhibit anabsorbed X-ray spectrum that is consistent with a high column density obscuringmedium around the active galactic nucleus. The HI absorption profile iscomplex, with four distinct components ranging in width from 5 to 300 kms$^{-1}$ and fractional depths from 0.2 to 20 per cent. In addition to systemicHI gas, in a circumnuclear disc or ring structure aligned with the radio jet,we find evidence for a possible broad outflow of neutral gas moving at a radialvelocity of $v \sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$. We infer that the expanding young radiosource ($t_{\rm age} \approx 2500$ yr) is cocooned within a dense medium andmay be driving circumnuclear neutral gas in an outflow of $\sim$ 1$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

Implications For The Origin Of GRB 051103 From LIGO Observations

  We present the results of a LIGO search for gravitational waves (GWs)associated with GRB 051103, a short-duration hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst(GRB) whose electromagnetically determined sky position is coincident with thespiral galaxy M81, which is 3.6 Mpc from Earth. Possible progenitors forshort-hard GRBs include compact object mergers and soft gamma repeater (SGR)giant flares. A merger progenitor would produce a characteristic GW signal thatshould be detectable at the distance of M81, while GW emission from an SGR isnot expected to be detectable at that distance. We found no evidence of a GWsignal associated with GRB 051103. Assuming weakly beamed gamma-ray emissionwith a jet semi-angle of 30 deg we exclude a binary neutron star merger in M81as the progenitor with a confidence of 98%. Neutron star-black hole mergers areexcluded with > 99% confidence. If the event occurred in M81 our findingssupport the the hypothesis that GRB 051103 was due to an SGR giant flare,making it the most distant extragalactic magnetar observed to date.

A search for gravitational waves associated with the August 2006 timing  glitch of the Vela pulsar

  The physical mechanisms responsible for pulsar timing glitches are thought toexcite quasi-normal mode oscillations in their parent neutron star that coupleto gravitational wave emission. In August 2006, a timing glitch was observed inthe radio emission of PSR B0833-45, the Vela pulsar. At the time of the glitch,the two co-located Hanford gravitational wave detectors of the LaserInterferometer Gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) were operational andtaking data as part of the fifth LIGO science run (S5). We present the firstdirect search for the gravitational wave emission associated with oscillationsof the fundamental quadrupole mode excited by a pulsar timing glitch. Nogravitational wave detection candidate was found. We place Bayesian 90%confidence upper limits of 6.3e-21 to 1.4e-20 on the peak intrinsic strainamplitude of gravitational wave ring-down signals, depending on which sphericalharmonic mode is excited. The corresponding range of energy upper limits is5.0e44 to 1.3e45 erg.
