On the tails of the limiting QuickSort density

  We give upper and lower asymptotic bounds for the left tail and for the right
tail of the continuous limiting QuickSort density f that are nearly matching in
each tail. The bounds strengthen results from a paper of Svante Janson (2015)
concerning the corresponding distribution function F. Furthermore, we obtain
similar bounds on absolute values of derivatives of f of each order.


Smoothness and decay properties of the limiting Quicksort density
  function

  Using Fourier analysis, we prove that the limiting distribution of the
standardized random number of comparisons used by Quicksort to sort an array of
n numbers has an everywhere positive and infinitely differentiable density f,
and that each derivative f^{(k)} enjoys superpolynomial decay at plus and minus
infinity. In particular, each f^{(k)} is bounded. Our method is sufficiently
computational to prove, for example, that f is bounded by 16.


Monodromy for some rank two Galois representations over CM fields

  We investigate local-global compatibility for cuspidal automorphic
representations $\pi$ for GL(2) over CM fields that are regular algebraic of
weight $0$. We prove that for a Dirichlet density one set of primes $l$ and any
$\iota : \overline{\mathbf{Q}}_l \cong \mathbf{C}$, the $l$-adic Galois
representation attached to $\pi$ and $\iota$ has nontrivial monodromy at any $v
\nmid l$ in $F$ at which $\pi$ is special.


QuickSort: Improved right-tail asymptotics for the limiting
  distribution, and large deviations

  We substantially refine asymptotic logarithmic upper bounds produced by
Svante Janson (2015) on the right tail of the limiting QuickSort distribution
function $F$ and by Fill and Hung (2018) on the right tails of the
corresponding density $f$ and of the absolute derivatives of $f$ of each order.
For example, we establish an upper bound on $\log[1 - F(x)]$ that matches
conjectured asymptotics of Knessl and Szpankowski (1999) through terms of order
$(\log x)^2$; the corresponding order for the Janson (2015) bound is the lead
order, $x \log x$.
  Using the refined asymptotic bounds on $F$, we derive right-tail large
deviation (LD) results for the distribution of the number of comparisons
required by QuickSort that substantially sharpen the two-sided LD results of
McDiarmid and Hayward (1996).


Potential automorphy over CM fields

  Let $F$ be a CM number field. We prove modularity lifting theorems for
regular $n$-dimensional Galois representations over $F$ without any
self-duality condition. We deduce that all elliptic curves $E$ over $F$ are
potentially modular, and furthermore satisfy the Sato--Tate conjecture. As an
application of a different sort, we also prove the Ramanujan Conjecture for
weight zero cuspidal automorphic representations for
$\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{A}_F)$.


Discourse Obligations in Dialogue Processing

  We show that in modeling social interaction, particularly dialogue, the
attitude of obligation can be a useful adjunct to the popularly considered
attitudes of belief, goal, and intention and their mutual and shared
counterparts. In particular, we show how discourse obligations can be used to
account in a natural manner for the connection between a question and its
answer in dialogue and how obligations can be used along with other parts of
the discourse context to extend the coverage of a dialogue system.


Incorporating POS Tagging into Language Modeling

  Language models for speech recognition tend to concentrate solely on
recognizing the words that were spoken. In this paper, we redefine the speech
recognition problem so that its goal is to find both the best sequence of words
and their syntactic role (part-of-speech) in the utterance. This is a necessary
first step towards tightening the interaction between speech recognition and
natural language understanding.


Partitions with Distinct Multiplicities of Parts: On An "Unsolved
  Problem" Posed By Herbert Wilf

  Wilf's Sixth Unsolved Problem asks for any interesting properties of the set
of partitions of integers for which the (nonzero) multiplicities of the parts
are all different. We refer to these as \emph{Wilf partitions}. Using $f(n)$ to
denote the number of Wilf partitions, we establish lead-order asymptotics for
$\ln{f(n)}$.


Metabolic Rate Calibrates the Molecular Clock: Reconciling Molecular and
  Fossil Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence

  Observations that rates of molecular evolution vary widely within and among
lineages have cast doubts upon the existence of a single molecular clock.
Differences in the timing of evolutionary events estimated from genetic and
fossil evidence have raised further questions about the existence of molecular
clocks and their use. Here we present a model of nucleotide substitution that
combines new theory on metabolic rate with the now classic neutral theory of
molecular evolution. The model quantitatively predicts rate heterogeneity, and
reconciles differences in molecular- and fossil-estimated dates of evolutionary
events. Model predictions are supported by extensive data from mitochondrial
and nuclear genomes. By accounting for the effects of body size and temperature
on metabolic rate, a single molecular clock explains heterogeneity in rates of
nucleotide substitution in different genes, taxa, and thermal environments.
This model suggests that there is indeed a general molecular clock, as
originally proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling, but that it ticks at a constant
substitution rate per unit mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit
time. More generally, the model suggests that body size and temperature combine
to control the overall rate of evolution through their effects on metabolism.


Classification and analysis of emission-line galaxies using mean field
  independent component analysis

  We present an analysis of the optical spectra of narrow emission-line
galaxies, based on mean field independent component analysis (MFICA). Samples
of galaxies were drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and used to
generate compact sets of `continuum' and `emission-line' component spectra.
These components can be linearly combined to reconstruct the observed spectra
of a wider sample of galaxies. Only 10 components - five continuum and five
emission line - are required to produce accurate reconstructions of essentially
all narrow emission-line galaxies; the median absolute deviations of the
reconstructed emission-line fluxes, given the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of
the observed spectra, are 1.2-1.8 sigma for the strong lines. After applying
the MFICA components to a large sample of SDSS galaxies we identify the regions
of parameter space that correspond to pure star formation and pure active
galactic nucleus (AGN) emission-line spectra, and produce high S/N
reconstructions of these spectra.
  The physical properties of the pure star formation and pure AGN spectra are
investigated by means of a series of photoionization models, exploiting the
faint emission lines that can be measured in the reconstructions. We are able
to recreate the emission line strengths of the most extreme AGN case by
assuming the central engine illuminates a large number of individual clouds
with radial distance and density distributions, f(r) ~ r^gamma and g(n) ~
n^beta, respectively. The best fit is obtained with gamma = -0.75 and beta =
-1.4. From the reconstructed star formation spectra we are able to estimate the
starburst ages. These preliminary investigations serve to demonstrate the
success of the MFICA-based technique in identifying distinct emission sources,
and its potential as a tool for the detailed analysis of the physical
properties of galaxies in large-scale surveys.


A Robust System for Natural Spoken Dialogue

  This paper describes a system that leads us to believe in the feasibility of
constructing natural spoken dialogue systems in task-oriented domains. It
specifically addresses the issue of robust interpretation of speech in the
presence of recognition errors. Robustness is achieved by a combination of
statistical error post-correction, syntactically- and semantically-driven
robust parsing, and extensive use of the dialogue context. We present an
evaluation of the system using time-to-completion and the quality of the final
solution that suggests that most native speakers of English can use the system
successfully with virtually no training.


Intonational Boundaries, Speech Repairs and Discourse Markers: Modeling
  Spoken Dialog

  To understand a speaker's turn of a conversation, one needs to segment it
into intonational phrases, clean up any speech repairs that might have
occurred, and identify discourse markers. In this paper, we argue that these
problems must be resolved together, and that they must be resolved early in the
processing stream. We put forward a statistical language model that resolves
these problems, does POS tagging, and can be used as the language model of a
speech recognizer. We find that by accounting for the interactions between
these tasks that the performance on each task improves, as does POS tagging and
perplexity.


Identifying Discourse Markers in Spoken Dialog

  In this paper, we present a method for identifying discourse marker usage in
spontaneous speech based on machine learning. Discourse markers are denoted by
special POS tags, and thus the process of POS tagging can be used to identify
discourse markers. By incorporating POS tagging into language modeling,
discourse markers can be identified during speech recognition, in which the
timeliness of the information can be used to help predict the following words.
We contrast this approach with an alternative machine learning approach
proposed by Litman (1996). This paper also argues that discourse markers can be
used to help the hearer predict the role that the upcoming utterance plays in
the dialog. Thus discourse markers should provide valuable evidence for
automatic dialog act prediction.


A Language for Planning with Statistics

  When a planner must decide whether it has enough evidence to make a decision
based on probability, it faces the sample size problem. Current planners using
probabilities need not deal with this problem because they do not generate
their probabilities from observations. This paper presents an event based
language in which the planner's probabilities are calculated from the binomial
random variable generated by the observed ratio of one type of event to
another. Such probabilities are subject to error, so the planner must
introspect about their validity. Inferences about the probability of these
events can be made using statistics. Inferences about the validity of the
approximations can be made using interval estimation. Interval estimation
allows the planner to avoid making choices that are only weakly supported by
the planner's evidence.


The size distribution of Near Earth Objects larger than 10 meters

  We analyzed data from the first year of a survey for Near Earth Objects
(NEOs) that we are carrying out with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the
4-meter Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. We
implanted synthetic NEOs into the data stream to derive our nightly detection
efficiency as a function of magnitude and rate of motion. Using these measured
efficiencies and the Solar System absolute magnitudes derived by the Minor
Planet Center for the 1377 measurements of 235 unique NEOs detected, we
directly derive, for the first time from a single observational data set, the
NEO size distribution from 1 km down to 10 meters. We find that there are
10^6.6 NEOs larger than 10 meters. This result implies a factor of ten fewer
small NEOs than some previous results, though our derived size distribution is
in good agreement with several other estimates.


Spitzer Imaging of the Nearby Rich Young Cluster, Cep OB3b

  We map the full extent of a rich massive young cluster in the Cep OB3b
association with the IRAC and MIPS instruments aboard the {\it Spitzer} Space
Telescope and the ACIS instrument aboard the $\it{Chandra}$ X-Ray Observatory.
At 700 pc, it is revealed to be the second nearest large ($>1000$ member),
young ($< 5$ Myr) cluster known. In contrast to the nearest large cluster, the
Orion Nebula Cluster, Cep OB3b is only lightly obscured and is mostly located
in a large cavity carved out of the surrounding molecular cloud. Our infrared
and X-ray datasets, as well as visible photometry from the literature, are used
to take a census of the young stars in Cep OB3b. We find that the young stars
within the cluster are concentrated in two sub-clusters; an eastern
sub-cluster, near the Cep B molecular clump, and a western sub-cluster, near
the Cep F molecular clump. Using our census of young stars, we examine the
fraction of young stars with infrared excesses indicative of circumstellar
disks. We create a map of the disk fraction throughout the cluster and find
that it is spatially variable. Due to these spatial variations, the two
sub-clusters exhibit substantially different average disk fractions from each
other: $32% \pm 4%$ and $50% \pm 6%$. We discuss whether the discrepant disk
fractions are due to the photodestruction of disks by the high mass members of
the cluster or whether they result from differences in the ages of the
sub-clusters. We conclude that the discrepant disk fractions are most likely
due to differences in the ages.


Localized Oscillatory Dissipation in Magnetopause Reconnection

  Data from the NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission are used to
investigate asymmetric magnetic reconnection at the dayside boundary between
the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind (the magnetopause).
High-resolution measurements of plasmas, electric and magnetic fields, and
waves are used to identify highly localized (~15 electron Debye lengths)
standing wave structures with large electric-field amplitudes (up to 100 mV/m).
These wave structures are associated with spatially oscillatory dissipation,
which appears as alternatingly positive and negative values of J dot E
(dissipation). For small guide magnetic fields the wave structures occur in the
electron stagnation region at the magnetosphere edge of the EDR. For larger
guide fields the structures also occur near the reconnection x-line. This
difference is explained in terms of channels for the out-of-plane current
(agyrotropic electrons at the stagnation point and guide-field-aligned
electrons at the x-line).


Meeting the Cool Neighbors X: Ultracool dwarfs from the 2MASS All-Sky
  Data Release

  Using data from the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalogue, we have extended
our census of nearby ultracool dwarfs to cover the full celestial sphere above
Galactic latitute 15 degrees. Starting with an initial catalogue of 2,139,484
sources, we have winnowed the sample to 467 candidate late-type M or L dwarfs
within 20 parsecs of the Sun. Fifty-four of those sources already have
spectroscopic observations confirming them as late-type dwarfs. We present
optical spectroscopy of 376 of the remaining 413 sources, and identify 44 as
ultracool dwarfs with spectroscopic distances less than 20 parsecs. Twenty-five
of the 37 sources that lack optical data have near-infrared spectroscopy.
Combining the present sample with our previous results and data from the
literature, we catalogue 94 L dwarf systems within 20 parsecs. We discuss the
distribution of activity, as measured by H-alpha emission, in this
volume-limited sample. We have coupled the present ultracool catalogue with
data for stars in the northern 8-parsec sample and recent (incomplete)
statistics for T dwarfs to provide a snapshot of the current 20-parsec census
as a function of spectral type.


The JCMT Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey VI: The distribution of gas and
  star formation in M81

  We present a first complete 12 CO J=3-2 map of M81, observed as part of the
Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey being carried out at the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope. We detect 9 regions of significant CO emission located at different
positions within the spiral arms, and confirm that the global CO emission in
the galaxy is low. We combine these data with a new H-alpha map obtained using
the Isaac Newton Telescope and archival HI, 24 microns and FUV images to
uncover a correlation between the molecular gas and star forming regions in
M81. For the nine regions detected in CO J=3-2, we combine our CO J=3-2 data
with existing CO J=1-0 data to calculate line ratios. We find that the ratio
J=(3-2)/(1-0) is in agreement with the range of typical values found in the
literature (0.2-0.8). Making reasonable assumptions, this allows us to
constrain the hydrogen density to the range (10^3-10^4) cm^{-3}. We also
estimated the amount of hydrogen produced in photo-dissociation regions near
the locations where CO J=3-2 was detected.


Magnetospheric Multiscale Dayside Reconnection Electron Diffusion Region
  Events

  We have used the high-resolution data of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)
mission dayside phase to identify twenty-one previously unreported encounters
with the electron diffusion region (EDR), as evidenced by electron agyrotropy,
ion jet reversals, and j dot E greater than 0. Three of the new EDR encounters,
which occurred within a one-minute-long interval on November 23rd, 2016, are
analyzed in detail. These events, which resulted from a relatively low and
oscillating magnetopause velocity, contained large electric fields (several
tens to hundreds of milliVolts per meter), crescent-shaped electron velocity
phase space densities, large currents (greater than 2 microAmperes per square
meter), and Ohmic heating of the plasma (near or exceeding 10 nanoWatts per
cubic meter). Because of the slow in-and-out motion of the magnetopause, two of
these events show the unprecedented mixture of perpendicular and parallel
crescents, indicating the first breaking and reconnecting of solar wind and
magnetospheric field lines. An extended list of thirty-two EDR or near-EDR
events is also included, and demonstrates a wide variety of observed plasma
behavior inside and surrounding the reconnection site.


YSOVAR: the first sensitive, wide-area, mid-IR photometric monitoring of
  the ONC

  We present initial results from time series imaging at infrared wavelengths
of 0.9 sq. degrees in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). During Fall 2009 we
obtained 81 epochs of Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron data over 40 consecutive days.
We extracted light curves with ~3% photometric accuracy for ~2000 ONC members
ranging from several solar masses down to well below the hydrogen burning mass
limit. For many of the stars, we also have time-series photometry obtained at
optical (Ic) and/or near-infrared (JKs) wavelengths. Our data set can be mined
to determine stellar rotation periods, identify new pre-main-sequence (PMS)
eclipsing binaries, search for new substellar Orion members, and help better
determine the frequency of circumstellar disks as a function of stellar mass in
the ONC. Our primary focus is the unique ability of 3.6 & 4.5 micron
variability information to improve our understanding of inner disk processes
and structure in the Class I and II young stellar objects (YSOs). In this
paper, we provide a brief overview of the YSOVAR Orion data obtained in Fall
2009, and we highlight our light curves for AA-Tau analogs - YSOs with narrow
dips in flux, most probably due to disk density structures passing through our
line of sight. Detailed follow-up observations are needed in order to better
quantify the nature of the obscuring bodies and what this implies for the
structure of the inner disks of YSOs.


The Spitzer Survey of Interstellar Clouds in the Gould Belt. VI. The
  Auriga-California Molecular Cloud observed with IRAC and MIPS

  We present observations of the Auriga-California Molecular Cloud (AMC) at
3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, 70 and 160 micron observed with the IRAC and MIPS
detectors as part of the Spitzer Gould Belt Legacy Survey. The total mapped
areas are 2.5 sq-deg with IRAC and 10.47 sq-deg with MIPS. This giant molecular
cloud is one of two in the nearby Gould Belt of star-forming regions, the other
being the Orion A Molecular Cloud (OMC). We compare source counts, colors and
magnitudes in our observed region to a subset of the SWIRE data that was
processed through our pipeline. Using color-magnitude and color-color diagrams,
we find evidence for a substantial population of 166 young stellar objects
(YSOs) in the cloud, many of which were previously unknown. Most of this
population is concentrated around the LkHalpha 101 cluster and the filament
extending from it. We present a quantitative description of the degree of
clustering and discuss the fraction of YSOs in the region with disks relative
to an estimate of the diskless YSO population. Although the AMC is similar in
mass, size and distance to the OMC, it is forming about 15 - 20 times fewer
stars.


The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Early Data Release

  We present the Early Data Release of the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral
field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. The SAMI Galaxy Survey is an ongoing
integral field spectroscopic survey of ~3400 low-redshift (z<0.12) galaxies,
covering galaxies in the field and in groups within the Galaxy And Mass
Assembly (GAMA) survey regions, and a sample of galaxies in clusters.
  In the Early Data Release, we publicly release the fully calibrated datacubes
for a representative selection of 107 galaxies drawn from the GAMA regions,
along with information about these galaxies from the GAMA catalogues. All
datacubes for the Early Data Release galaxies can be downloaded individually or
as a set from the SAMI Galaxy Survey website.
  In this paper we also assess the quality of the pipeline used to reduce the
SAMI data, giving metrics that quantify its performance at all stages in
processing the raw data into calibrated datacubes. The pipeline gives excellent
results throughout, with typical sky subtraction residuals in the continuum of
0.9-1.2 per cent, a relative flux calibration uncertainty of 4.1 per cent
(systematic) plus 4.3 per cent (statistical), and atmospheric dispersion
removed with an accuracy of 0."09, less than a fifth of a spaxel.


Near and Mid-IR Photometry of the Pleiades, and a New List of Substellar
  Candidate Members

  We make use of new near and mid-IR photometry of the Pleiades cluster in
order to help identify proposed cluster members. We also use the new photometry
with previously published photometry to define the single-star main sequence
locus at the age of the Pleiades in a variety of color-magnitude planes.
  The new near and mid-IR photometry extend effectively two magnitudes deeper
than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a new
set of candidate very low mass and sub-stellar mass members of the Pleiades in
the central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate members
fainter than Ks =14 (corresponding to 0.1 Mo). These candidate members should
eventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made down
to of order 0.04 solar masses.
  We also use new IRAC data, in particular the images obtained at 8 um, in
order to comment briefly on interstellar dust in and near the Pleiades. We
confirm, as expected, that -- with one exception -- a sample of low mass stars
recently identified as having 24 um excesses due to debris disks do not have
significant excesses at IRAC wavelengths. However, evidence is also presented
that several of the Pleiades high mass stars are found to be impacting with
local condensations of the molecular cloud that is passing through the Pleiades
at the current epoch.


The Spitzer survey of interstellar clouds in the Gould Belt. II. The
  Cepheus Flare observed with IRAC and MIPS

  We present Spitzer IRAC (~2 deg^2) and MIPS (~8 deg^2) observations of the
Cepheus Flare which is associated with the Gould Belt, at an approximate
distance of ~300 pc. Around 6500 sources are detected in all four IRAC bands,
of which ~900 have MIPS 24 micron detections. We identify 133 YSO candidates
using color-magnitude diagram techniques, a large number of the YSO candidates
are associated with the NGC 7023 reflection nebula. Cross identifications were
made with the Guide Star Catalog II and the IRAS Faint Source Catalog, and
spectral energy distributions (SED) were constructed. SED modeling was
conducted to estimate the degree of infrared excess. It was found that a large
majority of disks were optically thick accreting disks, suggesting that there
has been little disk evolution in these sources. Nearest-neighbor clustering
analysis identified four small protostellar groups (L1228, L1228N, L1251A, and
L1251B) with 5-15 members each and the larger NGC 7023 association with 32 YSO
members. The star formation efficiency for cores with clusters of protostars
and for those without clusters was found to be ~8% and ~1% respectively. The
cores L1155, L1241, and L1247 are confirmed to be starless down to our
luminosity limit of L_bol=0.06 L_sol.


The Spitzer c2d Survey of Weak-Line T Tauri Stars. III. The Transition
  from Primordial Disks to Debris Disks

  We present 3.6 to 70 {\mu}m Spitzer photometry of 154 weak-line T Tauri stars
(WTTS) in the Chamaeleon, Lupus, Ophiuchus and Taurus star formation regions,
all of which are within 200 pc of the Sun. For a comparative study, we also
include 33 classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) which are located in the same star
forming regions. Spitzer sensitivities allow us to robustly detect the
photosphere in the IRAC bands (3.6 to 8 {\mu}m) and the 24 {\mu}m MIPS band. In
the 70 {\mu}m MIPS band, we are able to detect dust emission brighter than
roughly 40 times the photosphere. These observations represent the most
sensitive WTTS survey in the mid to far infrared to date, and reveal the
frequency of outer disks (r = 3-50 AU) around WTTS. The 70 {\mu}m photometry
for half the c2d WTTS sample (the on-cloud objects), which were not included in
the earlier papers in this series, Padgett et al. (2006) and Cieza et al.
(2007), are presented here for the first time. We find a disk frequency of 19%
for on-cloud WTTS, but just 5% for off- cloud WTTS, similar to the value
reported in the earlier works. WTTS exhibit spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) that are quite diverse, spanning the range from optically thick to
optically thin disks. Most disks become more tenuous than Ldisk/L* = 2 x 10^-3
in 2 Myr, and more tenuous than Ldisk/L* = 5 x 10^-4 in 4 Myr.


ZFOURGE catalogue of AGN candidates: an enhancement of 160μm-derived
  star-formation rates in active galaxies to $z$ = 3.2

  We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates within the FourStar
Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) to determine the impact they have on
star-formation in their host galaxies. We first identify a population of radio,
X-ray, and infrared-selected AGN by cross-matching the deep $K_{s}$-band
imaging of ZFOURGE with overlapping multi-wavelength data. From this, we
construct a mass-complete (log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) $\ge$ 9.75), AGN luminosity
limited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2 - 3.2. We compare the rest-frame U
- V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of the
AGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ
diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent
galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using
160{\mu}m Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star-formation rate of
AGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34$\pm$0.07 dex with respect to the control
sample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by
infrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much
as a factor of ~5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray
AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a
marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and
postulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating
galaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.


Young Stellar Objects in the Gould Belt

  We present the full catalog of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) identified in the
18 molecular clouds surveyed by the Spitzer Space Telescope "cores to disks"
(c2d) and "Gould Belt" (GB) Legacy surveys. Using standard techniques developed
by the c2d project, we identify 3239 candidate YSOs in the 18 clouds, 2966 of
which survive visual inspection and form our final catalog of YSOs in the Gould
Belt. We compile extinction corrected SEDs for all 2966 YSOs and calculate and
tabulate the infrared spectral index, bolometric luminosity, and bolometric
temperature for each object. We find that 326 (11%), 210 (7%), 1248 (42%), and
1182 (40%) are classified as Class 0+I, Flat-spectrum, Class II, and Class III,
respectively, and show that the Class III sample suffers from an overall
contamination rate by background AGB stars between 25% and 90%. Adopting
standard assumptions, we derive durations of 0.40-0.78 Myr for Class 0+I YSOs
and 0.26-0.50 Myr for Flat-spectrum YSOs, where the ranges encompass
uncertainties in the adopted assumptions. Including information from
(sub)millimeter wavelengths, one-third of the Class 0+I sample is classified as
Class 0, leading to durations of 0.13-0.26 Myr (Class 0) and 0.27-0.52 Myr
(Class I). We revisit infrared color-color diagrams used in the literature to
classify YSOs and propose minor revisions to classification boundaries in these
diagrams. Finally, we show that the bolometric temperature is a poor
discriminator between Class II and Class III YSOs.


Innovative Science

  Sir, We write as senior scientists about a problem vital to the scientific
enterprise and prosperity. Nowadays, funding is a lengthy and complex business.
First, universities themselves must approve all proposals for submission.
Funding agencies then subject those that survive to peer review, a process by
which a few researchers, usually acting anonymously, assess a proposal's
chances that it will achieve its goals, is the best value for money, is
relevant to a national priority and will impact on a socio-economic problem.
Only 25% of proposals received by the funding agencies are funded. These
protracted processes force researchers to exploit existing knowledge, severely
discourage open-ended studies and are hugely time-consuming. They are also new:
before 1970, few researchers wrote proposals. Now they are virtually mandatory.


The SAMI galaxy survey: Galaxy Interactions and Kinematic Anomalies in
  Abell 119

  Galaxy mergers are important events that can determine the fate of a galaxy
by changing its morphology, star-formation activity and mass growth. Merger
systems have commonly been identified from their disturbed morphologies, and we
now can employ Integral Field Spectroscopy to detect and analyze the impact of
mergers on stellar kinematics as well. We visually classified galaxy morphology
using deep images ($\mu_{\rm r} = 28\,\rm mag\,\, arcsec^{-2}$) taken by the
Blanco 4-m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. In this
paper we investigate 63 bright ($M_{\rm r}<-19.3$) spectroscopically-selected
galaxies in Abell 119; of which 53 are early type and 20 galaxies show a
disturbed morphology by visual inspection. A misalignment between the major
axes in the photometric image and the kinematic map is conspicuous in
morphologically-disturbed galaxies. Our sample is dominated by early-type
galaxies, yet it shows a surprisingly tight Tully-Fisher relation except for
the morphologically-disturbed galaxies which show large deviations. Three out
of the eight slow rotators in our sample are morphology disturbed. The
visually-selected morphologically-disturbed galaxies are generally more
asymmetric, visually as well as kinematically. Our findings suggest that galaxy
interactions, including mergers and perhaps fly-bys, play an important role in
determining the orientation and magnitude of galaxy's angular momentum.


GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS: The Morphologies of Ultraluminous Infrared
  Galaxies at z~2

  Using deep 100-160 micron observations in GOODS-S from the GOODS-H survey,
combined with HST/WFC3 NIR imaging from CANDELS, we present the first
morphological analysis of a complete, FIR selected sample of 52 ULIRGs at z~2.
We also make use of a comparison sample of galaxies without Herschel detections
but with the same z and magnitude distribution. Our visual classifications of
these two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroid
morphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,
interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ULIRGs. The combination of disk
and irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactions
and minor mergers could play an important role in ULIRGs at z~2. We compare
these fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range and
find that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with L_IR while the
fraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.
At comparable luminosities, the fraction of ULIRGs with various morphological
classifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. We investigate the position of the
ULIRGs, along with 70 LIRGs, on the specific star formation rate versus
redshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (lie more than a factor of
3 above the main sequence relation). The morphologies of starbursts are
dominated by interacting and merging systems (50%). If irregular disks are
included as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starbursts
are involved in a merger or interaction at some level. Although the final
coalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities of
ULIRGs at z~2 as is the case locally, the large fraction of interactions at all
stages and potential minor mergers suggest that the high star formation rates
of ULIRGs are still largely externally triggered at z~2.


Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Methods for Cluster Cosmology and
  Application to the SDSS

  We perform the first blind analysis of cluster abundance data. Specifically,
we derive cosmological constraints from the abundance and weak-lensing signal
of \redmapper\ clusters of richness $\lambda\geq 20$ in the redshift range
$z\in[0.1,0.3]$ as measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
simultaneously fit for cosmological parameters and the richness--mass relation
of the clusters. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with massive
neutrinos, we find $S_8 \equiv
\sigma_{8}(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.79^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. This value is both
consistent and competitive with that derived from cluster catalogues selected
in different wavelengths. Our result is also consistent with the combined
probes analyses by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Kilo-Degree Survey
(KiDS), and with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies as measured
by \planck. We demonstrate that the cosmological posteriors are robust against
variation of the richness--mass relation model and to systematics associated
with the calibration of the selection function. In combination with Baryon
Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) data, we
constrain the Hubble rate to be $h=0.66\pm 0.02$, independent of the CMB.
Future work aimed at improving our understanding of the scatter of the
richness--mass relation has the potential to significantly improve the
precision of our cosmological posteriors. The methods described in this work
were developed for use in the forthcoming analysis of cluster abundances in the
DES. Our SDSS analysis constitutes the first part of a staged-unblinding
analysis of the full DES data set.


Phenotypic redshifts with self-organizing maps: A novel method to
  characterize redshift distributions of source galaxies for weak lensing

  Wide-field imaging surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) rely on
coarse measurements of spectral energy distributions in a few filters to
estimate the redshift distribution of source galaxies. In this regime, cosmic
variance, shot noise, and selection effects limit the attainable accuracy of
redshift calibration and thus of cosmological constraints. We present a new
method to combine wide-field, few-filter measurements with catalogs from deep
fields with additional filters and sufficiently low photometric noise to break
degeneracies in photometric redshifts. The multi-band deep field is used as an
intermediary between wide-field observations and accurate redshifts, greatly
reducing cosmic variance, shot noise, and selection effects. Our implementation
of the method uses self-organizing maps to group galaxies into
\textit{phenotypes} based on their observed fluxes, and is tested using a mock
DES catalog created from $N$-body simulations. It yields a typical uncertainty
on the mean redshift in each of five tomographic bins for a simulation of the
DES Year 3 weak-lensing tomographic analysis of $\sigma_{\Delta z} = 0.007$,
which is a 60% improvement compared to the Year 1 analysis. Although the
implementation of the method is tailored to DES, its formalism can be applied
to other large photometric surveys with a similar observing strategy.


Young Stellar Object Variability (YSOVAR): Long Timescale Variations in
  the Mid-Infrared

  The YSOVAR (Young Stellar Object VARiability) Spitzer Space Telescope
observing program obtained the first extensive mid-infrared (3.6 & 4.5 um)
time-series photometry of the Orion Nebula Cluster plus smaller footprints in
eleven other star-forming cores (AFGL490, NGC1333, MonR2, GGD 12-15, NGC2264,
L1688, Serpens Main, Serpens South, IRAS 20050+2720, IC1396A, and Ceph C).
There are ~29,000 unique objects with light curves in either or both IRAC
channels in the YSOVAR data set. We present the data collection and reduction
for the Spitzer and ancillary data, and define the "standard sample" on which
we calculate statistics, consisting of fast cadence data, with epochs about
twice per day for ~40d. We also define a "standard sample of members",
consisting of all the IR-selected members and X-ray selected members. We
characterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectral
energy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in the
fast cadence data--the Stetson index, a chi^2 fit to a flat light curve, and
significant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescales
possible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzer
mission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign. The fraction of members in each
cluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of the
ratio of Class I/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with a
higher fraction of Class I objects also have a higher fraction of long-term
variables. For objects with a YSOVAR-determined period and a [3.6]-[8] color,
we find that a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorter
periods to have an IR excess. We do not find any evidence for variability that
causes [3.6]-[4.5] excesses to appear or vanish within our data; out of members
and field objects combined, at most 0.02% may have transient IR excesses.


Optical-SZE Scaling Relations for DES Optically Selected Clusters within
  the SPT-SZ Survey

  We study the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signature in South Pole
Telescope (SPT) data for an ensemble of 719 optically identified galaxy
clusters selected from 124.6 deg$^2$ of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) science
verification data, detecting a stacked SZE signal down to richness
$\lambda\sim20$. The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps of
the 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey at the positions of the DES clusters, and the
degeneracy between SZE observable and matched-filter size is broken by adopting
as priors SZE and optical mass-observable relations that are either calibrated
using SPT selected clusters or through the Arnaud et al. (2010, A10) X-ray
analysis. We measure the SPT signal to noise $\zeta$-$\lambda$, relation and
two integrated Compton-$y$ $Y_\textrm{500}$-$\lambda$ relations for the
DES-selected clusters and compare these to model expectations accounting for
the SZE-optical center offset distribution. For clusters with $\lambda > 80$,
the two SPT calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements,
while for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by a
factor of $0.61 \pm 0.12$ compared to the prediction. For clusters at $20 <
\lambda < 80$, the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of
$\sim$0.20-0.80 (between 2.3 and 10~$\sigma$ significance) compared to the
prediction, with the SPT calibrated scaling relations and larger $\lambda$
clusters showing generally better agreement. We quantify the required
corrections to achieve consistency, showing that there is a richness dependent
bias that can be explained by some combination of contamination of the
observables and biases in the estimated masses. We discuss possible physical
effects, as contamination from line-of-sight projections or from point sources,
larger offsets in the SZE-optical centering or larger scatter in the
$\lambda$-mass relation at lower richnesses.


Pathway to the Square Kilometre Array - The German White Paper -

  The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is the most ambitious radio telescope ever
planned. With a collecting area of about a square kilometre, the SKA will be
far superior in sensitivity and observing speed to all current radio
facilities. The scientific capability promised by the SKA and its technological
challenges provide an ideal base for interdisciplinary research, technology
transfer, and collaboration between universities, research centres and
industry. The SKA in the radio regime and the European Extreme Large Telescope
(E-ELT) in the optical band are on the roadmap of the European Strategy Forum
for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) and have been recognised as the essential
facilities for European research in astronomy.
  This "White Paper" outlines the German science and R&D interests in the SKA
project and will provide the basis for future funding applications to secure
German involvement in the Square Kilometre Array.


Standing Together for Reproducibility in Large-Scale Computing: Report
  on reproducibility@XSEDE

  This is the final report on reproducibility@xsede, a one-day workshop held in
conjunction with XSEDE14, the annual conference of the Extreme Science and
Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). The workshop's discussion-oriented
agenda focused on reproducibility in large-scale computational research. Two
important themes capture the spirit of the workshop submissions and
discussions: (1) organizational stakeholders, especially supercomputer centers,
are in a unique position to promote, enable, and support reproducible research;
and (2) individual researchers should conduct each experiment as though someone
will replicate that experiment. Participants documented numerous issues,
questions, technologies, practices, and potentially promising initiatives
emerging from the discussion, but also highlighted four areas of particular
interest to XSEDE: (1) documentation and training that promotes reproducible
research; (2) system-level tools that provide build- and run-time information
at the level of the individual job; (3) the need to model best practices in
research collaborations involving XSEDE staff; and (4) continued work on
gateways and related technologies. In addition, an intriguing question emerged
from the day's interactions: would there be value in establishing an annual
award for excellence in reproducible research?


The SAMI Galaxy Survey: extraplanar gas, galactic winds, and their
  association with star formation history

  We investigate a sample of 40 local, main-sequence, edge-on disc galaxies
using integral field spectroscopy with the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral
field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey to understand the link between
properties of the extraplanar gas and their host galaxies. The kinematics
properties of the extraplanar gas, including velocity asymmetries and increased
dispersion, are used to differentiate galaxies hosting large-scale galactic
winds from those dominated by the extended diffuse ionized gas. We find rather
that a spectrum of diffuse gas-dominated to wind dominated galaxies exist. The
wind-dominated galaxies span a wide range of star formation rates ($-1 \lesssim
\log({\rm SFR/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}) \lesssim 0.5$) across the whole stellar mass
range of the sample ($8.5 \lesssim \log({\rm M_{*}/M_{\odot}}) \lesssim 11$).
The wind galaxies also span a wide range in SFR surface densities ($10^{-3}
\textrm{--} 10^{-1.5}\rm~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$) that is much lower than
the canonical threshold of $\rm0.1~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$. The wind
galaxies on average have higher SFR surface densities and higher $\rm
H\delta_A$ values than those without strong wind signatures. The enhanced $\rm
H\delta_A$ indicates that bursts of star formation in the recent past are
necessary for driving large-scale galactic winds. We demonstrate with Sloan
Digital Sky Survey data that galaxies with high SFR surface density have
experienced bursts of star formation in the recent past. Our results imply that
the galactic winds revealed in our study are indeed driven by bursts of star
formation, and thus probing star formation in the time domain is crucial for
finding and understanding galactic winds.


Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Weak Lensing Mass Calibration of
  redMaPPer Galaxy Clusters

  We constrain the mass--richness scaling relation of redMaPPer galaxy clusters
identified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data using weak gravitational
lensing. We split clusters into $4\times3$ bins of richness $\lambda$ and
redshift $z$ for $\lambda\geq20$ and $0.2 \leq z \leq 0.65$ and measure the
mean masses of these bins using their stacked weak lensing signal. By modeling
the scaling relation as $\langle M_{\rm 200m}|\lambda,z\rangle = M_0
(\lambda/40)^F ((1+z)/1.35)^G$, we constrain the normalization of the scaling
relation at the 5.0 per cent level as $M_0 = [3.081 \pm 0.075 ({\rm stat}) \pm
0.133 ({\rm sys})] \cdot 10^{14}\ {\rm M}_\odot$ at $\lambda=40$ and $z=0.35$.
The richness scaling index is constrained to be $F=1.356 \pm 0.051\ ({\rm
stat})\pm 0.008\ ({\rm sys})$ and the redshift scaling index $G=-0.30\pm 0.30\
({\rm stat})\pm 0.06\ ({\rm sys})$. These are the tightest measurements of the
normalization and richness scaling index made to date. We use a semi-analytic
covariance matrix to characterize the statistical errors in the recovered weak
lensing profiles. Our analysis accounts for the following sources of systematic
error: shear and photometric redshift errors, cluster miscentering, cluster
member dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties in the modeling
of the halo--mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projection
effects. We discuss prospects for reducing this systematic error budget, which
dominates the uncertainty on $M_0$. Our result is in excellent agreement with,
but has significantly smaller uncertainties than, previous measurements in the
literature, and augurs well for the power of the DES cluster survey as a tool
for precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid and
WFIRST.


The Astropy Problem

  The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org) is, in its own words, "a community
effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster
interoperability between Python astronomy packages." For five years this
project has been managed, written, and operated as a grassroots,
self-organized, almost entirely volunteer effort while the software is used by
the majority of the astronomical community. Despite this, the project has
always been and remains to this day effectively unfunded. Further, contributors
receive little or no formal recognition for creating and supporting what is now
critical software. This paper explores the problem in detail, outlines possible
solutions to correct this, and presents a few suggestions on how to address the
sustainability of general purpose astronomical software.

Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Cosmological Constraints from Galaxy
  Clustering and Weak Lensing

  We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy clustering
and weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg$^2$ of $griz$ imaging data from
the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-point
functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source
galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation
function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the
galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source
galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use
independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation and
validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias,
the bulk of the analysis was carried out while blind to the true results; we
describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during
this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM
cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for
$\Lambda$CDM) or 7 (for $w$CDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrino
mass density and including the 457 $\times$ 457 element analytic covariance
matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point
functions, and from their combination obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8
(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.783^{+0.021}_{-0.025}$ and $\Omega_m =
0.264^{+0.032}_{-0.019}$ for $\Lambda$CDM for $w$CDM, we find $S_8 =
0.794^{+0.029}_{-0.027}$, $\Omega_m = 0.279^{+0.043}_{-0.022}$, and
$w=-0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ at 68% CL. The precision of these DES Y1 results
rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing
a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms.
Although the DES Y1 best-fit values for $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ are lower than the
central values from Planck ...


Overview of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys

  The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys are a combination of three public projects
(the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey, and the
Mayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image approximately 14,000 deg^2
of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical
bands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and
the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint is
split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is
conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times
and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly
uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a
catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to
estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from
the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22
micorons) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite
during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data
releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also
released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys
project.


Dark Matter Benchmark Models for Early LHC Run-2 Searches: Report of the
  ATLAS/CMS Dark Matter Forum

  This document is the final report of the ATLAS-CMS Dark Matter Forum, a forum
organized by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations with the participation of experts
on theories of Dark Matter, to select a minimal basis set of dark matter
simplified models that should support the design of the early LHC Run-2
searches. A prioritized, compact set of benchmark models is proposed,
accompanied by studies of the parameter space of these models and a repository
of generator implementations. This report also addresses how to apply the
Effective Field Theory formalism for collider searches and present the results
of such interpretations.


Discovery of HI gas in a young radio galaxy at $z = 0.44$ using the
  Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder

  We report the discovery of a new 21-cm HI absorption system using
commissioning data from the Boolardy Engineering Test Array of the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Using the 711.5 - 1015.5 MHz band of
ASKAP we were able to conduct a blind search for the 21-cm line in a continuous
redshift range between $z = 0.4$ and 1.0, which has, until now, remained
largely unexplored. The absorption line is detected at $z = 0.44$ towards the
GHz-peaked spectrum radio source PKS B1740$-$517 and demonstrates ASKAP's
excellent capability for performing a future wide-field survey for HI
absorption at these redshifts. Optical spectroscopy and imaging using the
Gemini-South telescope indicates that the HI gas is intrinsic to the host
galaxy of the radio source. The narrow OIII emission lines show clear
double-peaked structure, indicating either large-scale outflow or rotation of
the ionized gas. Archival data from the \emph{XMM-Newton} satellite exhibit an
absorbed X-ray spectrum that is consistent with a high column density obscuring
medium around the active galactic nucleus. The HI absorption profile is
complex, with four distinct components ranging in width from 5 to 300 km
s$^{-1}$ and fractional depths from 0.2 to 20 per cent. In addition to systemic
HI gas, in a circumnuclear disc or ring structure aligned with the radio jet,
we find evidence for a possible broad outflow of neutral gas moving at a radial
velocity of $v \sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$. We infer that the expanding young radio
source ($t_{\rm age} \approx 2500$ yr) is cocooned within a dense medium and
may be driving circumnuclear neutral gas in an outflow of $\sim$ 1
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.


Implications For The Origin Of GRB 051103 From LIGO Observations

  We present the results of a LIGO search for gravitational waves (GWs)
associated with GRB 051103, a short-duration hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst
(GRB) whose electromagnetically determined sky position is coincident with the
spiral galaxy M81, which is 3.6 Mpc from Earth. Possible progenitors for
short-hard GRBs include compact object mergers and soft gamma repeater (SGR)
giant flares. A merger progenitor would produce a characteristic GW signal that
should be detectable at the distance of M81, while GW emission from an SGR is
not expected to be detectable at that distance. We found no evidence of a GW
signal associated with GRB 051103. Assuming weakly beamed gamma-ray emission
with a jet semi-angle of 30 deg we exclude a binary neutron star merger in M81
as the progenitor with a confidence of 98%. Neutron star-black hole mergers are
excluded with > 99% confidence. If the event occurred in M81 our findings
support the the hypothesis that GRB 051103 was due to an SGR giant flare,
making it the most distant extragalactic magnetar observed to date.


A search for gravitational waves associated with the August 2006 timing
  glitch of the Vela pulsar

  The physical mechanisms responsible for pulsar timing glitches are thought to
excite quasi-normal mode oscillations in their parent neutron star that couple
to gravitational wave emission. In August 2006, a timing glitch was observed in
the radio emission of PSR B0833-45, the Vela pulsar. At the time of the glitch,
the two co-located Hanford gravitational wave detectors of the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) were operational and
taking data as part of the fifth LIGO science run (S5). We present the first
direct search for the gravitational wave emission associated with oscillations
of the fundamental quadrupole mode excited by a pulsar timing glitch. No
gravitational wave detection candidate was found. We place Bayesian 90%
confidence upper limits of 6.3e-21 to 1.4e-20 on the peak intrinsic strain
amplitude of gravitational wave ring-down signals, depending on which spherical
harmonic mode is excited. The corresponding range of energy upper limits is
5.0e44 to 1.3e45 erg.
