  In this note, we prove that smooth self-shrinkers in $\Real^{n+1}$, that areentire graphs, are hyperplanes. Previously Ecker and Huisken showed that smoothself-shrinkers, that are entire graphs and have at most polynomial growth, arehyperplanes. The point of this note is that no growth assumption at infinity isneeded.

  We study the problem of generating abstractive summaries for opinionatedtext. We propose an attention-based neural network model that is able to absorbinformation from multiple text units to construct informative, concise, andfluent summaries. An importance-based sampling method is designed to allow theencoder to integrate information from an important subset of input. Automaticevaluation indicates that our system outperforms state-of-the-art abstractiveand extractive summarization systems on two newly collected datasets of moviereviews and arguments. Our system summaries are also rated as more informativeand grammatical in human evaluation.

Vertex-deleted subgraphs and regular factors from regular graph

  Let $k$, $m$ and $r$ be three integers such that $2\leq k\leq m\leq r$.  Let $G$ be a $2r$-regular, $2m$-edge-connected graph of odd order.  We obtain some sufficient conditions, which guarantee $G-v$ contains a$k$-factor for all $v\in V(G)$.

  We generalize the ancient solutions of the Ricci flow on certain principal${\rm SO}(3)$ bundles over compact quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds constructedby Bakas, Kong, and Ni to certain $RP^3$ fibre bundles over a product of twocompact quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds. The ancient solutions are of Type I,$\kappa$-noncollapsed, and have positive Ricci curvature. Analogous solutionson even-dimensional non-K\"ahlerian bundle spaces are also constructed.

Scaling limit of the Stein variational gradient descent: the mean field  regime

  We study an interacting particle system in $\mathbf{R}^d$ motivated by Steinvariational gradient descent [Q. Liu and D. Wang, NIPS 2016], a deterministicalgorithm for sampling from a given probability density with unknownnormalization. We prove that in the large particle limit the empirical measureof the particle system converges to a solution of a non-local and nonlinearPDE. We also prove global existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solutionto the limiting PDE. Finally, we prove that the solution to the PDE convergesto the unique invariant solution in long time limit.

Multiple Antennas Secure Transmission under Pilot Spoofing and Jamming  Attack

  Transmitter-side channel state information (CSI) of the legitimatedestination plays a critical role in physical layer secure transmissions.However, channel training procedure is vulnerable to the pilot spoofing attack(PSA) or pilot jamming attack (PJA) by an active eavesdropper (Eve), whichinevitably results in severe private information leakage. In this paper, wepropose a random channel training (RCT) based secure downlink transmissionframework for a time division duplex (TDD) multiple antennas base station (BS).In the proposed RCT scheme, multiple orthogonal pilot sequences (PSs) aresimultaneously allocated to the legitimate user (LU), and the LU randomlyselects one PS from the assigned PS set to transmit. Under either the PSA orPJA, we provide the detailed steps for the BS to identify the PS transmitted bythe LU, and to simultaneously estimate channels of the LU and Eve. Theprobability that the BS makes an incorrect decision on the PS of the LU isanalytically investigated. Finally, closed-form secure beamforming (SB) vectorsare designed and optimized to enhance the secrecy rates during the downlinktransmissions. Numerical results show that the secrecy performance is greatlyimproved compared to the conventional channel training scheme wherein only onePS is assigned to the LU.

The tunneling induced level splittings are determined to be $^2T_{1u} \bigoplus ^2 T_{2u}$ and $^1 A_g \bigoplus ^1 H_g$ for $C_{60}^{1-}$ and$C_{60}^{2-}$, respectively, which should give rise to observable effects inexperiments.

Limitations of Nanotechnology for Atom Interferometry

  Do van der Waals interactions determine the smallest nanostructures that canbe used for atom optics? This question is studied with regard to the problem ofdesigning an atom interferometer with optimum sensitivity to de Broglie wavephase shifts. The optimum sensitivity to acceleration and rotation rates isalso considered. For these applications we predict that nanostructures with aperiod smaller than 40 nm will cause atom interferometers to perform poorlybecause van der Waals interactions adversely affect how nanostructure gratingswork as beam-splitters.

Thesecurity of the communication is analyzed.

Efficient generation of isolated attosecond pulses with high  beam-quality by two-color Bessel-Gauss beams

  The generation of isolated attosecond pulses with high efficiency and highbeam quality is essential for attosec- ond spectroscopy. We numericallyinvestigate the supercontinuum generation in a neutral rare-gas medium drivenby a two-color Bessel-Gauss beam. The results show that an efficient smoothsupercontinuum in the plateau is obtained after propagation, and the spatialprofile of the generated attosecond pulse is Gaussian-like with the divergenceangle of 0.1 degree in the far field. This bright source with high beam qualityis beneficial for detecting and controlling the microscopic processes onattosecond time scale.

A Remark on a Uniqueness Property of High Multiplicity Tangent Flows in  Dimension Three

  In this note, we combine the work of Ilmanen and of Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzito observe a uniqueness property for tangent flows at the first singular timeof a smooth mean curvature flow of a closed surface in 3-dimensional Euclideanspace. Specifically, if, at a fixed singular point, one tangent flow is apositive integer multiple of a shrinking plane, cylinder or sphere, then,modulo rotations, all tangent flows at the point are the same.

Ancient Ricci Flow Solutions on Bundles

  We generalize the circle bundle examples of ancient solutions of the Ricciflow discovered by Bakas, Kong, and Ni to a class of principal torus bundlesover an arbitrary finite product of Fano K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds studied byWang and Ziller in the context of Einstein geometry. As a result, continuousfamilies of $\kappa$-collapsed and $\kappa$-noncollapsed ancient solutions oftype I are obtained on circle bundles for all odd dimensions $\geq 7$. Indimension $7$ such examples moreover exist on pairs of homeomorphic but notdiffeomorphic manifolds. Continuous families of $\kappa$-collapsed ancientsolutions of type I are also obtained on torus bundles for all dimensions $\geq8$.

Socially-Informed Timeline Generation for Complex Events

  Existing timeline generation systems for complex events consider onlyinformation from traditional media, ignoring the rich social context providedby user-generated content that reveals representative public interests orinsightful opinions. We instead aim to generate socially-informed timelinesthat contain both news article summaries and selected user comments. We presentan optimization framework designed to balance topical cohesion between thearticle and comment summaries along with their informativeness and coverage ofthe event. Automatic evaluations on real-world datasets that cover four complexevents show that our system produces more informative timelines thanstate-of-the-art systems. In human evaluation, the associated comment summariesare furthermore rated more insightful than editor's picks and comments rankedhighly by users.

A Piece of My Mind: A Sentiment Analysis Approach for Online Dispute  Detection

  We investigate the novel task of online dispute detection and propose asentiment analysis solution to the problem: we aim to identify the sequence ofsentence-level sentiments expressed during a discussion and to use them asfeatures in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for thediscussion as a whole. We evaluate dispute detection approaches on a newlycreated corpus of Wikipedia Talk page disputes and find that classifiers thatrely on our sentiment tagging features outperform those that do not. The bestmodel achieves a very promising F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80.

Unsupervised Topic Modeling Approaches to Decision Summarization in  Spoken Meetings

  We present a token-level decision summarization framework that utilizes thelatent topic structures of utterances to identify "summary-worthy" words.Concretely, a series of unsupervised topic models is explored and experimentalresults show that fine-grained topic models, which discover topics at theutterance-level rather than the document-level, can better identify the gist ofthe decision-making process. Moreover, our proposed token-level summarizationapproach, which is able to remove redundancies within utterances, outperformsexisting utterance ranking based summarization methods. Finally, contextinformation is also investigated to add additional relevant information to thesummary.

Focused Meeting Summarization via Unsupervised Relation Extraction

  We present a novel unsupervised framework for focused meeting summarizationthat views the problem as an instance of relation extraction. We adapt anexisting in-domain relation learner (Chen et al., 2011) by exploiting a set oftask-specific constraints and features. We evaluate the approach on a decisionsummarization task and show that it outperforms unsupervised utterance-levelextractive summarization baselines as well as an existing genericrelation-extraction-based summarization method. Moreover, our approach producessummaries competitive with those generated by supervised methods in terms ofthe standard ROUGE score.

The space of asymptotically conical self-expanders of mean curvature  flow

  We show that the space of asymptotically conical self-expanders of the meancurvature flow is a smooth Banach manifold. An immediate consequence is thatnon-degenerate self-expanders -- that is, those self-expanders that admit nonon-trivial normal Jacobi fields that fix the asymptotic cone -- are generic ina certain sense.

An integer degree for asymptotically conical self-expanders

  We establish the existence of an integer degree for the natural projectionmap from the space of parameterizations of asymptotically conicalself-expanders to the space of parameterizations of the asymptotic cones whenthis map is proper. As an application we show that there is an open set in thespace of cones in the three-dimensional Euclidean space for which each cone inthe set has a strictly unstable self-expanding annuli asymptotic to it.
