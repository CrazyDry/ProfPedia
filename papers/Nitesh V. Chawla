Predicting Online Video Engagement Using Clickstreams

  In the nascent days of e-content delivery, having a superior product wasenough to give companies an edge against the competition. With today's fiercelycompetitive market, one needs to be multiple steps ahead, especially when itcomes to understanding consumers. Focusing on a large set of web portals ownedand managed by a private communications company, we propose methods by whichthese sites' clickstream data can be used to provide a deep understanding oftheir visitors, as well as their interests and preferences. We further expandthe use of this data to show that it can be effectively used to predict userengagement to video streams.

Weighted reciprocity in human communication networks

  In this paper we define a metric for reciprocity---the degree of balance in asocial relationship---appropriate for weighted social networks in order toinvestigate the distribution of this dyadic feature in a large-scale systembuilt from trace-logs of over a billion cell-phone communication events acrossmillions of actors. We find that dyadic relations in this network arecharacterized by much larger degrees of imbalance than we would expect ifpersons kept only those relationships that exhibited close to full reciprocity.We point to two structural features of human communication behavior andrelationship formation---the division of contacts into strong and weak ties andthe tendency to form relationships with similar others---that either help orhinder the ability of persons to obtain communicative balance in theirrelationships. We examine the extent to which deviations from reciprocity inthe observed network are partially traceable to these characteristics.

Evaluating Link Prediction Methods

  Link prediction is a popular research area with important applications in avariety of disciplines, including biology, social science, security, andmedicine. The fundamental requirement of link prediction is the accurate andeffective prediction of new links in networks. While there are many differentmethods proposed for link prediction, we argue that the practical performancepotential of these methods is often unknown because of challenges in theevaluation of link prediction, which impact the reliability and reproducibilityof results. We describe these challenges, provide theoretical proofs andempirical examples demonstrating how current methods lead to questionableconclusions, show how the fallacy of these conclusions is illuminated bymethods we propose, and develop recommendations for consistent, standard, andapplicable evaluation metrics. We also recommend the use of precision-recallthreshold curves and associated areas in lieu of receiver operatingcharacteristic curves due to complications that arise from extreme imbalance inthe link prediction classification problem.

Influence Activation Model: A New Perspective in Social Influence  Analysis and Social Network Evolution

  What drives the propensity for the social network dynamics? Social influenceis believed to drive both off-line and on-line human behavior, however it hasnot been considered as a driver of social network evolution. Our analysissuggest that, while the network structure affects the spread of influence insocial networks, the network is in turn shaped by social influence activity(i.e., the process of social influence wherein one person's attitudes andbehaviors affect another's). To that end, we develop a novel model of networkevolution where the dynamics of network follow the mechanism of influencepropagation, which are not captured by the existing network evolution models.Our experiments confirm the predictions of our model and demonstrate theimportant role that social influence can play in the process of networkevolution. As well exploring the reason of social network evolution, differentgenres of social influence have been spotted having different effects on thenetwork dynamics. These findings and methods are essential to both ourunderstanding of the mechanisms that drive network evolution and our knowledgeof the role of social influence in shaping the network structure.

Detecting Anomalies in Sequential Data with Higher-order Networks

  A major branch of anomaly detection methods relies on dynamic networks: rawsequence data is first converted to a series of networks, then critical changepoints are identified in the evolving network structure. However, existingapproaches use first-order networks (FONs) to represent the underlying rawdata, which may lose important higher-order sequence patterns, makinghigher-order anomalies undetectable in subsequent analysis. We present a novelhigher-order anomaly detection method that is both parameter-free and scalable,building on an improved higher-order network (HON) construction algorithm. Weshow the proposed higher-order anomaly detection algorithm is effective indiscovering variable orders of anomalies. Our data includes a synthetic 11billion web clickstreams and a real-world taxi trajectory data.

Long-term Compliance Habits: What Early Data Tells Us

  The rise in popularity of physical activity trackers provides extensiveopportunities for research on personal health, however, barriers such ascompliance attrition can lead to substantial losses in data. As such, insightsinto student's compliance habits could support researcher's decisions whendesigning long-term studies. In this paper, we examined 392 students on acollege campus currently two and a half years into an ongoing study. We findthat compliance data from as early as one month correlated with student'slikelihood of dropping out of the study (p < .001) and compliance long-term (p< .001). The findings in this paper identify long-term compliance habits andthe viability of their early detection.

CARL: Content-Aware Representation Learning for Heterogeneous Networks

  Heterogeneous networks not only present a challenge of heterogeneity in thetypes of nodes and relations, but also the attributes and content associatedwith the nodes. While recent works have looked at representation learning onhomogeneous and heterogeneous networks, there is no work that has collectivelyaddressed the following challenges: (a) the heterogeneous structuralinformation of the network consisting of multiple types of nodes and relations;(b) the unstructured semantic content (e.g., text) associated with nodes; and(c) online updates due to incoming new nodes in growing network. We addressthese challenges by developing a Content-Aware Representation Learning model(CARL). CARL performs joint optimization of heterogeneous SkipGram and deepsemantic encoding for capturing both heterogeneous structural closeness andunstructured semantic relations among all nodes, as function of node content,that exist in the network. Furthermore, an additional online update module isproposed for efficiently learning representations of incoming nodes. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate that CARL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines invarious heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as link prediction, documentretrieval, node recommendation and relevance search. We also demonstrate theeffectiveness of the CARL's online update module through a categoryvisualization study.

Social Network Structure is Predictive of Health and Wellness

  Social networks influence health-related behaviors, such as obesity andsmoking. While researchers have studied social networks as a driver fordiffusion of influences and behaviors, it is less understood how the structureor topology of the network, in itself, impacts an individual's health behaviorsand wellness state. In this paper, we investigate whether the structure ortopology of a social network offers additional insight and predictability on anindividual's health and wellness. We develop a model called the Network-Drivenhealth predictor (NetCARE) that leverages features representative of socialnetwork structure. Using a large longitudinal data set of students enrolled inthe NetHealth study at the University of Notre Dame, we show that the NetCAREmodel improves the overall prediction performance over the baseline models --that use demographics and physical attributes -- by 38%, 65%, 55%, and 54% forthe wellness states -- stress, happiness, positive attitude, and self-assessedhealth -- considered in this paper.

Incremental embedding for temporal networks

  Prediction over edges and nodes in graphs requires appropriate andefficiently achieved data representation. Recent research on representationlearning for dynamic networks resulted in a significant progress. However, themore precise and accurate methods, the greater computational and memorycomplexity. Here, we introduce ICMEN - the first-in-class incrementalmeta-embedding method that produces vector representations of nodes respectingtemporal dependencies in the graph. ICMEN efficiently constructs nodes'embedding from historical representations by linearly convex combinationsmaking the process less memory demanding than state-of-the-art embeddingalgorithms. The method is capable of constructing representation for inactiveand new nodes without a need to re-embed. The results of link prediction onseveral real-world datasets shown that applying ICMEN incremental meta-methodto any base embedding approach, we receive similar results and save memory andcomputational power. Taken together, our work proposes a new way of efficientonline representation learning in dynamic complex networks.

Predictors of short-term decay of cell phone contacts in a large scale  communication network

  Under what conditions is an edge present in a social network at time t likelyto decay or persist by some future time t + Delta(t)? Previous researchaddressing this issue suggests that the network range of the people involved inthe edge, the extent to which the edge is embedded in a surrounding structure,and the age of the edge all play a role in edge decay. This paper uses weighteddata from a large-scale social network built from cell-phone calls in an 8-weekperiod to determine the importance of edge weight for the decay/persistenceprocess. In particular, we study the relative predictive power of directedweight, embeddedness, newness, and range (measured as outdegree) with respectto edge decay and assess the effectiveness with which a simple decision treeand logistic regression classifier can accurately predict whether an edge thatwas active in one time period continues to be so in a future time period. Wefind that directed edge weight, weighted reciprocity and time-dependentmeasures of edge longevity are highly predictive of whether we classify an edgeas persistent or decayed, relative to the other types of factors at the dyadand neighborhood level.

Microscopic Evolution of Social Networks by Triad Position Profile

  Disentangling the mechanisms underlying the social network evolution is oneof social science's unsolved puzzles. Preferential attachment is a powerfulmechanism explaining social network dynamics, yet not able to explain allscaling-laws in social networks. Recent advances in understanding socialnetwork dynamics demonstrate that several scaling-laws in social networksfollow as natural consequences of triadic closure. Macroscopic comparisonsbetween them are discussed empirically in many works. However the networkevolution drives not only the emergence of macroscopic scaling but also themicroscopic behaviors. Here we exploit two fundamental aspects of the networkmicroscopic evolution: the individual influence evolution and the process oflink formation. First we develop a novel framework for the microscopicevolution, where the mechanisms of preferential attachment and triadic closureare well balanced. Then on four real-world datasets we apply our approach fortwo microscopic problems: node's prominence prediction and link prediction,where our method yields significant predictive improvement over baselinesolutions. Finally to be rigorous and comprehensive, we further observe thatour framework has a stronger generalization capacity across different kinds ofsocial networks for two microscopic prediction problems. We unveil thesignificant factors with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore beenpossible, and shed new light on networks evolution.

Predicting Node Degree Centrality with the Node Prominence Profile

  Centrality of a node measures its relative importance within a network. Thereare a number of applications of centrality, including inferring the influenceor success of an individual in a social network, and the resulting socialnetwork dynamics. While we can compute the centrality of any node in a givennetwork snapshot, a number of applications are also interested in knowing thepotential importance of an individual in the future. However, currentcentrality is not necessarily an effective predictor of future centrality.While there are different measures of centrality, we focus on degree centralityin this paper. We develop a method that reconciles preferential attachment andtriadic closure to capture a node's prominence profile. We show that theproposed node prominence profile method is an effective predictor of degreecentrality. Notably, our analysis reveals that individuals in the early stageof evolution display a distinctive and robust signature in degree centralitytrend, adequately predicted by their prominence profile. We evaluate our workacross four real-world social networks. Our findings have importantimplications for the applications that require prediction of a node's futuredegree centrality, as well as the study of social network dynamics.

Inferring Unusual Crowd Events From Mobile Phone Call Detail Records

  The pervasiveness and availability of mobile phone data offer the opportunityof discovering usable knowledge about crowd behaviors in urban environments.Cities can leverage such knowledge in order to provide better services (e.g.,public transport planning, optimized resource allocation) and safer cities.Call Detail Record (CDR) data represents a practical data source to detect andmonitor unusual events considering the high level of mobile phone penetration,compared with GPS equipped and open devices. In this paper, we provide amethodology that is able to detect unusual events from CDR data that typicallyhas low accuracy in terms of space and time resolution. Moreover, we introducea concept of unusual event that involves a large amount of people who expose anunusual mobility behavior. Our careful consideration of the issues that comefrom coarse-grained CDR data ultimately leads to a completely general frameworkthat can detect unusual crowd events from CDR data effectively and efficiently.Through extensive experiments on real-world CDR data for a large city inAfrica, we demonstrate that our method can detect unusual events with 16%higher recall and over 10 times higher precision, compared to state-of-the-artmethods. We implement a visual analytics prototype system to help end usersanalyze detected unusual crowd events to best suit different applicationscenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on thedetection of unusual events from CDR data with considerations of its temporaland spatial sparseness and distinction between user unusual activities anddaily routines.

Representing higher-order dependencies in networks

  To ensure the correctness of network analysis methods, the network (as theinput) has to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying data.However, when representing sequential data from complex systems such as globalshipping traffic or web clickstream traffic as networks, conventional networkrepresentations that implicitly assume the Markov property (first-orderdependency) can quickly become limiting. This assumption holds that whenmovements are simulated on the network, the next movement depends only on thecurrent node, discounting the fact that the movement may depend on severalprevious steps. However, we show that data derived from many complex systemscan show up to fifth-order dependencies. In these cases, the oversimplifyingassumption of the first-order network representation can lead to inaccuratenetwork analysis results. To address this problem, we propose the Higher-OrderNetwork (HON) representation that can discover and embed variable orders ofdependencies in a network representation. Through a comprehensive empiricalevaluation and analysis, we establish several desirable characteristics of HON,including accuracy, scalability, and direct compatibility with the existingsuite of network analysis methods. We illustrate how HON can be applied to abroad variety of tasks, such as random walking, clustering, and ranking, and wedemonstrate that by using it as input, HON yields more accurate results withoutany modification to these tasks.

Modeling the Interplay Between Individual Behavior and Network  Distributions

  It is well-known that many networks follow a power-law degree distribution;however, the factors that influence the formation of their distributions arestill unclear. How can one model the connection between individual actions andnetwork distributions? How can one explain the formation of group phenomena andtheir evolutionary patterns?  In this paper, we propose a unified framework, M3D, to model human dynamicsin social networks from three perspectives: macro, meso, and micro. At themicro-level, we seek to capture the way in which an individual user decideswhether to perform an action. At the meso-level, we study how group behaviordevelops and evolves over time, based on individual actions. At themacro-level, we try to understand how network distributions such as power-law(or heavy-tailed phenomena) can be explained by group behavior. We providetheoretical analysis for the proposed framework, and discuss the connection ofour framework with existing work.  The framework offers a new, flexible way to explain the interplay betweenindividual user actions and network distributions, and can benefit manyapplications. To model heavy-tailed distributions from partially observedindividual actions and to predict the formation of group behaviors, we applyM3D to three different genres of networks: Tencent Weibo, Citation, and Flickr.We also use information-burst prediction as a particular application toquantitatively evaluate the predictive power of the proposed framework. Ourresults on the Weibo indicate that M3D's prediction performance exceeds that ofseveral alternative methods by up to 30\%.

Structural Diversity and Homophily: A Study Across More than One Hundred  Big Networks

  A widely recognized organizing principle of networks is structural homophily,which suggests that people with more common neighbors are more likely toconnect with each other. However, what influence the diverse structuresembedded in common neighbors have on link formation is much lesswell-understood. To explore this problem, we begin by characterizing thestructural diversity of common neighborhoods. Using a collection of 120large-scale networks, we demonstrate that the impact of the common neighborhooddiversity on link existence can vary substantially across networks. We findthat its positive effect on Facebook and negative effect on LinkedIn suggestdifferent underlying networking needs in these networks. We also discoverstriking cases where diversity violates the principle of homophily---that is,where fewer mutual connections may lead to a higher tendency to link with eachother. We then leverage structural diversity to develop a common neighborhoodsignature (CNS), which we apply to a large set of networks to uncover uniquenetwork superfamilies not discoverable by conventional methods. Our findingsshed light on the pursuit to understand the ways in which network structuresare organized and formed, pointing to potential advancement in designing graphgeneration models and recommender systems.

Can Scientific Impact Be Predicted?

  A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations. However, due totheir heavy-tailed distribution, citations are fundamentally difficult topredict. Instead, to characterize scientific impact, we address two analogousquestions asked by many scientific researchers: "How will my h-index evolveover time, and which of my previously or newly published papers will contributeto it?" To answer these questions, we perform two related tasks. First, wedevelop a model to predict authors' future h-indices based on their currentscientific impact. Second, we examine the factors that drive papers---eitherpreviously or newly published---to increase their authors' predicted futureh-indices. By leveraging relevant factors, we can predict an author's h-indexin five years with an R2 value of 0.92 and whether a previously (newly)published paper will contribute to this future h-index with an F1 score of 0.99(0.77). We find that topical authority and publication venue are crucial tothese effective predictions, while topic popularity is surprisinglyinconsequential. Further, we develop an online tool that allows users togenerate informed h-index predictions. Our work demonstrates the predictabilityof scientific impact, and can help scholars to effectively leverage theirposition of "standing on the shoulders of giants."

Do the Young Live in a "Smaller World" Than the Old? Age-Specific  Degrees of Separation in Human Communication

  In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of "age-specific small worlds"using data from a large-scale mobile communication network approximatinginteraction patterns at societal scale. Rather than asking whether two randomindividuals are separated by a small number of links, we ask whetherindividuals in specific age groups live in a small world in relation toindividuals from other age groups. Our analysis shows that there is systematicvariation in this age-relative small world effect. Young people live in the"smallest world," being separated from other young people and their parent'sgeneration via a smaller number of intermediaries than older individuals. Theoldest people live in the "least small world," being separated from their sameage peers and their younger counterparts by a larger number of intermediaries.Variation in the small world effect is specific to age as a node attribute(being absent in the case of gender) and is consistently observed under severaldata robustness checks. The discovery of age-specific small worlds isconsistent with well-known social mechanisms affecting the way age interactswith network connectivity and the relative prevalence of kin ties and non-kinties observed in this network. This social pattern has significant implicationsfor our understanding of generation-specific dynamics of information cascades,diffusion phenomena, and the spread of fads and fashions.

Gender Differences in Communication Behaviors, Spatial Proximity  Patterns, and Mobility Habits

  The existence of gender differences in the structure and composition ofsocial networks is a well established finding in the social and behavioralsciences, but researchers continue to debate whether structural, dispositional,or life course factors are the primary driver of these differences. In thispaper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns ofinteraction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensingplatform comprised of an ensemble of individuals' phone calls, text messaging,face-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attemptto isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relativelyhomogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in thelife course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility datareveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative,distributional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly,some patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-genderpreference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximitycontext, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower(and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women.These findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect ofgender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication andmobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing todifferences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles ofsociability and interaction characteristic of men and women.

Analysis of Link Formation, Persistence and Dissolution in NetSense Data

  We study a unique behavioral network data set (based on periodic surveys andon electronic logs of dyadic contact via smartphones) collected at theUniversity of Notre Dame.The participants are a sample of members of theentering class of freshmen in the fall of 2011 whose opinions on a wide varietyof political and social issues and activities on campus were regularly recorded- at the beginning and end of each semester - for the first three years oftheir residence on campus. We create a communication activity network impliedby call and text data, and a friendship network based on surveys. Both networksare limited to students participating in the NetSense surveys. We aim atfinding student traits and activities on which agreements correlate well withformation and persistence of links while disagreements are highly correlatedwith non-existence or dissolution of links in the two social networks that wecreated. Using statistical analysis and machine learning, we observe severaltraits and activities displaying such correlations, thus being of potential useto predict social network evolution.

HoNVis: Visualizing and Exploring Higher-Order Networks

  Unlike the conventional first-order network (FoN), the higher-order network(HoN) provides a more accurate description of transitions by creatingadditional nodes to encode higher-order dependencies. However, there exists novisualization and exploration tool for the HoN. For applications such as thedevelopment of strategies to control species invasion through global shippingwhich is known to exhibit higher-order dependencies, the existing FoNvisualization tools are limited. In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novelvisual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of theglobal ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multipleviews to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., theglobal, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports ofinterest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-ordernodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact isenabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the globalocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approachwith a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in speciesinvasion. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of this framework to otherreal-world applications such as information diffusion in social networks andepidemic spreading through air transportation.

Range-limited Centrality Measures in Complex Networks

  Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in bothnon-weighted and weighted directed complex networks. We introduce an efficientmethod that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centralitybased on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\ell = 1,...,L$ in case ofnon-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantitiesbased on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than $w_{\ell}=\ell\Delta$, $\ell=1,2...,L=R/\Delta$. These measures provide a systematicdescription on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to itsnetwork neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the wholenetwork. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling lawsfor large non-weighted networks. As the computation of traditional centralitymeasures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficientlyestimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including thetraditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that theranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralitiesquickly freezes as function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top-listcan be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largestnode-to-node distance for a network of $N$ nodes, exploiting the aforementionedscaling behavior. These observations are illustrated on model networks and on alarge social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ($\sim 5.5\times 10^6$nodes and $\sim 2.7\times 10^7$ edges). Finally, we apply these concepts toefficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as thesmallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) andillustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weightednetworks in detecting such backbones.

Will This Paper Increase Your h-index? Scientific Impact Prediction

  Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the output ofscholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of scientificimpact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predictingthe number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness ofsuch predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-lawdistribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations areextremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare.Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question askedby many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: "Willthis paper increase my h-index?" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships fromthe premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientificimpact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper toincrease the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authorityon the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published arecrucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while thetopic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly littlerelevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5%potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author'sh-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate aself-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability thatit will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest currenth-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification ofscientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and moreeffectively leverage their position of "standing on the shoulders of giants."

Beyond Volume: The Impact of Complex Healthcare Data on the Machine  Learning Pipeline

  From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operatedunder a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long andarduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging fromelectronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, topublic health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount ofdigital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity forintegrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiplefacets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability toderive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability toexecute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data onwhich the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significanteffort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of dataobtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it isimportant to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. Infact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcaredata presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accountedfor throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses onhighlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinctcomponents, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributesof the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerationsduring model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of modeloutput. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relatesto the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may imposeon the efficiency of machine learning techniques.

A Deep Neural Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis  in Multivariate Time Series Data

  Nowadays, multivariate time series data are increasingly collected in variousreal world systems, e.g., power plants, wearable devices, etc. Anomalydetection and diagnosis in multivariate time series refer to identifyingabnormal status in certain time steps and pinpointing the root causes. Buildingsuch a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capturethe temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode theinter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, thesystem should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels ofanomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the factthat a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed,few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose aMulti-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to performanomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically,MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices tocharacterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps.Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employedto encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention basedConvolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capturethe temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode theinter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder isused to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signaturematrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensiveempirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant datasetdemonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.
