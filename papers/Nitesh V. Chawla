Predicting Online Video Engagement Using Clickstreams

  In the nascent days of e-content delivery, having a superior product was
enough to give companies an edge against the competition. With today's fiercely
competitive market, one needs to be multiple steps ahead, especially when it
comes to understanding consumers. Focusing on a large set of web portals owned
and managed by a private communications company, we propose methods by which
these sites' clickstream data can be used to provide a deep understanding of
their visitors, as well as their interests and preferences. We further expand
the use of this data to show that it can be effectively used to predict user
engagement to video streams.


Weighted reciprocity in human communication networks

  In this paper we define a metric for reciprocity---the degree of balance in a
social relationship---appropriate for weighted social networks in order to
investigate the distribution of this dyadic feature in a large-scale system
built from trace-logs of over a billion cell-phone communication events across
millions of actors. We find that dyadic relations in this network are
characterized by much larger degrees of imbalance than we would expect if
persons kept only those relationships that exhibited close to full reciprocity.
We point to two structural features of human communication behavior and
relationship formation---the division of contacts into strong and weak ties and
the tendency to form relationships with similar others---that either help or
hinder the ability of persons to obtain communicative balance in their
relationships. We examine the extent to which deviations from reciprocity in
the observed network are partially traceable to these characteristics.


Evaluating Link Prediction Methods

  Link prediction is a popular research area with important applications in a
variety of disciplines, including biology, social science, security, and
medicine. The fundamental requirement of link prediction is the accurate and
effective prediction of new links in networks. While there are many different
methods proposed for link prediction, we argue that the practical performance
potential of these methods is often unknown because of challenges in the
evaluation of link prediction, which impact the reliability and reproducibility
of results. We describe these challenges, provide theoretical proofs and
empirical examples demonstrating how current methods lead to questionable
conclusions, show how the fallacy of these conclusions is illuminated by
methods we propose, and develop recommendations for consistent, standard, and
applicable evaluation metrics. We also recommend the use of precision-recall
threshold curves and associated areas in lieu of receiver operating
characteristic curves due to complications that arise from extreme imbalance in
the link prediction classification problem.


Influence Activation Model: A New Perspective in Social Influence
  Analysis and Social Network Evolution

  What drives the propensity for the social network dynamics? Social influence
is believed to drive both off-line and on-line human behavior, however it has
not been considered as a driver of social network evolution. Our analysis
suggest that, while the network structure affects the spread of influence in
social networks, the network is in turn shaped by social influence activity
(i.e., the process of social influence wherein one person's attitudes and
behaviors affect another's). To that end, we develop a novel model of network
evolution where the dynamics of network follow the mechanism of influence
propagation, which are not captured by the existing network evolution models.
Our experiments confirm the predictions of our model and demonstrate the
important role that social influence can play in the process of network
evolution. As well exploring the reason of social network evolution, different
genres of social influence have been spotted having different effects on the
network dynamics. These findings and methods are essential to both our
understanding of the mechanisms that drive network evolution and our knowledge
of the role of social influence in shaping the network structure.


Detecting Anomalies in Sequential Data with Higher-order Networks

  A major branch of anomaly detection methods relies on dynamic networks: raw
sequence data is first converted to a series of networks, then critical change
points are identified in the evolving network structure. However, existing
approaches use first-order networks (FONs) to represent the underlying raw
data, which may lose important higher-order sequence patterns, making
higher-order anomalies undetectable in subsequent analysis. We present a novel
higher-order anomaly detection method that is both parameter-free and scalable,
building on an improved higher-order network (HON) construction algorithm. We
show the proposed higher-order anomaly detection algorithm is effective in
discovering variable orders of anomalies. Our data includes a synthetic 11
billion web clickstreams and a real-world taxi trajectory data.


Long-term Compliance Habits: What Early Data Tells Us

  The rise in popularity of physical activity trackers provides extensive
opportunities for research on personal health, however, barriers such as
compliance attrition can lead to substantial losses in data. As such, insights
into student's compliance habits could support researcher's decisions when
designing long-term studies. In this paper, we examined 392 students on a
college campus currently two and a half years into an ongoing study. We find
that compliance data from as early as one month correlated with student's
likelihood of dropping out of the study (p < .001) and compliance long-term (p
< .001). The findings in this paper identify long-term compliance habits and
the viability of their early detection.


CARL: Content-Aware Representation Learning for Heterogeneous Networks

  Heterogeneous networks not only present a challenge of heterogeneity in the
types of nodes and relations, but also the attributes and content associated
with the nodes. While recent works have looked at representation learning on
homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, there is no work that has collectively
addressed the following challenges: (a) the heterogeneous structural
information of the network consisting of multiple types of nodes and relations;
(b) the unstructured semantic content (e.g., text) associated with nodes; and
(c) online updates due to incoming new nodes in growing network. We address
these challenges by developing a Content-Aware Representation Learning model
(CARL). CARL performs joint optimization of heterogeneous SkipGram and deep
semantic encoding for capturing both heterogeneous structural closeness and
unstructured semantic relations among all nodes, as function of node content,
that exist in the network. Furthermore, an additional online update module is
proposed for efficiently learning representations of incoming nodes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CARL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as link prediction, document
retrieval, node recommendation and relevance search. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of the CARL's online update module through a category
visualization study.


Social Network Structure is Predictive of Health and Wellness

  Social networks influence health-related behaviors, such as obesity and
smoking. While researchers have studied social networks as a driver for
diffusion of influences and behaviors, it is less understood how the structure
or topology of the network, in itself, impacts an individual's health behaviors
and wellness state. In this paper, we investigate whether the structure or
topology of a social network offers additional insight and predictability on an
individual's health and wellness. We develop a model called the Network-Driven
health predictor (NetCARE) that leverages features representative of social
network structure. Using a large longitudinal data set of students enrolled in
the NetHealth study at the University of Notre Dame, we show that the NetCARE
model improves the overall prediction performance over the baseline models --
that use demographics and physical attributes -- by 38%, 65%, 55%, and 54% for
the wellness states -- stress, happiness, positive attitude, and self-assessed
health -- considered in this paper.


Incremental embedding for temporal networks

  Prediction over edges and nodes in graphs requires appropriate and
efficiently achieved data representation. Recent research on representation
learning for dynamic networks resulted in a significant progress. However, the
more precise and accurate methods, the greater computational and memory
complexity. Here, we introduce ICMEN - the first-in-class incremental
meta-embedding method that produces vector representations of nodes respecting
temporal dependencies in the graph. ICMEN efficiently constructs nodes'
embedding from historical representations by linearly convex combinations
making the process less memory demanding than state-of-the-art embedding
algorithms. The method is capable of constructing representation for inactive
and new nodes without a need to re-embed. The results of link prediction on
several real-world datasets shown that applying ICMEN incremental meta-method
to any base embedding approach, we receive similar results and save memory and
computational power. Taken together, our work proposes a new way of efficient
online representation learning in dynamic complex networks.


Predictors of short-term decay of cell phone contacts in a large scale
  communication network

  Under what conditions is an edge present in a social network at time t likely
to decay or persist by some future time t + Delta(t)? Previous research
addressing this issue suggests that the network range of the people involved in
the edge, the extent to which the edge is embedded in a surrounding structure,
and the age of the edge all play a role in edge decay. This paper uses weighted
data from a large-scale social network built from cell-phone calls in an 8-week
period to determine the importance of edge weight for the decay/persistence
process. In particular, we study the relative predictive power of directed
weight, embeddedness, newness, and range (measured as outdegree) with respect
to edge decay and assess the effectiveness with which a simple decision tree
and logistic regression classifier can accurately predict whether an edge that
was active in one time period continues to be so in a future time period. We
find that directed edge weight, weighted reciprocity and time-dependent
measures of edge longevity are highly predictive of whether we classify an edge
as persistent or decayed, relative to the other types of factors at the dyad
and neighborhood level.


Microscopic Evolution of Social Networks by Triad Position Profile

  Disentangling the mechanisms underlying the social network evolution is one
of social science's unsolved puzzles. Preferential attachment is a powerful
mechanism explaining social network dynamics, yet not able to explain all
scaling-laws in social networks. Recent advances in understanding social
network dynamics demonstrate that several scaling-laws in social networks
follow as natural consequences of triadic closure. Macroscopic comparisons
between them are discussed empirically in many works. However the network
evolution drives not only the emergence of macroscopic scaling but also the
microscopic behaviors. Here we exploit two fundamental aspects of the network
microscopic evolution: the individual influence evolution and the process of
link formation. First we develop a novel framework for the microscopic
evolution, where the mechanisms of preferential attachment and triadic closure
are well balanced. Then on four real-world datasets we apply our approach for
two microscopic problems: node's prominence prediction and link prediction,
where our method yields significant predictive improvement over baseline
solutions. Finally to be rigorous and comprehensive, we further observe that
our framework has a stronger generalization capacity across different kinds of
social networks for two microscopic prediction problems. We unveil the
significant factors with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been
possible, and shed new light on networks evolution.


Predicting Node Degree Centrality with the Node Prominence Profile

  Centrality of a node measures its relative importance within a network. There
are a number of applications of centrality, including inferring the influence
or success of an individual in a social network, and the resulting social
network dynamics. While we can compute the centrality of any node in a given
network snapshot, a number of applications are also interested in knowing the
potential importance of an individual in the future. However, current
centrality is not necessarily an effective predictor of future centrality.
While there are different measures of centrality, we focus on degree centrality
in this paper. We develop a method that reconciles preferential attachment and
triadic closure to capture a node's prominence profile. We show that the
proposed node prominence profile method is an effective predictor of degree
centrality. Notably, our analysis reveals that individuals in the early stage
of evolution display a distinctive and robust signature in degree centrality
trend, adequately predicted by their prominence profile. We evaluate our work
across four real-world social networks. Our findings have important
implications for the applications that require prediction of a node's future
degree centrality, as well as the study of social network dynamics.


Inferring Unusual Crowd Events From Mobile Phone Call Detail Records

  The pervasiveness and availability of mobile phone data offer the opportunity
of discovering usable knowledge about crowd behaviors in urban environments.
Cities can leverage such knowledge in order to provide better services (e.g.,
public transport planning, optimized resource allocation) and safer cities.
Call Detail Record (CDR) data represents a practical data source to detect and
monitor unusual events considering the high level of mobile phone penetration,
compared with GPS equipped and open devices. In this paper, we provide a
methodology that is able to detect unusual events from CDR data that typically
has low accuracy in terms of space and time resolution. Moreover, we introduce
a concept of unusual event that involves a large amount of people who expose an
unusual mobility behavior. Our careful consideration of the issues that come
from coarse-grained CDR data ultimately leads to a completely general framework
that can detect unusual crowd events from CDR data effectively and efficiently.
Through extensive experiments on real-world CDR data for a large city in
Africa, we demonstrate that our method can detect unusual events with 16%
higher recall and over 10 times higher precision, compared to state-of-the-art
methods. We implement a visual analytics prototype system to help end users
analyze detected unusual crowd events to best suit different application
scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the
detection of unusual events from CDR data with considerations of its temporal
and spatial sparseness and distinction between user unusual activities and
daily routines.


Structural Diversity and Homophily: A Study Across More than One Hundred
  Big Networks

  A widely recognized organizing principle of networks is structural homophily,
which suggests that people with more common neighbors are more likely to
connect with each other. However, what influence the diverse structures
embedded in common neighbors have on link formation is much less
well-understood. To explore this problem, we begin by characterizing the
structural diversity of common neighborhoods. Using a collection of 120
large-scale networks, we demonstrate that the impact of the common neighborhood
diversity on link existence can vary substantially across networks. We find
that its positive effect on Facebook and negative effect on LinkedIn suggest
different underlying networking needs in these networks. We also discover
striking cases where diversity violates the principle of homophily---that is,
where fewer mutual connections may lead to a higher tendency to link with each
other. We then leverage structural diversity to develop a common neighborhood
signature (CNS), which we apply to a large set of networks to uncover unique
network superfamilies not discoverable by conventional methods. Our findings
shed light on the pursuit to understand the ways in which network structures
are organized and formed, pointing to potential advancement in designing graph
generation models and recommender systems.


Can Scientific Impact Be Predicted?

  A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations. However, due to
their heavy-tailed distribution, citations are fundamentally difficult to
predict. Instead, to characterize scientific impact, we address two analogous
questions asked by many scientific researchers: "How will my h-index evolve
over time, and which of my previously or newly published papers will contribute
to it?" To answer these questions, we perform two related tasks. First, we
develop a model to predict authors' future h-indices based on their current
scientific impact. Second, we examine the factors that drive papers---either
previously or newly published---to increase their authors' predicted future
h-indices. By leveraging relevant factors, we can predict an author's h-index
in five years with an R2 value of 0.92 and whether a previously (newly)
published paper will contribute to this future h-index with an F1 score of 0.99
(0.77). We find that topical authority and publication venue are crucial to
these effective predictions, while topic popularity is surprisingly
inconsequential. Further, we develop an online tool that allows users to
generate informed h-index predictions. Our work demonstrates the predictability
of scientific impact, and can help scholars to effectively leverage their
position of "standing on the shoulders of giants."


Do the Young Live in a "Smaller World" Than the Old? Age-Specific
  Degrees of Separation in Human Communication

  In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of "age-specific small worlds"
using data from a large-scale mobile communication network approximating
interaction patterns at societal scale. Rather than asking whether two random
individuals are separated by a small number of links, we ask whether
individuals in specific age groups live in a small world in relation to
individuals from other age groups. Our analysis shows that there is systematic
variation in this age-relative small world effect. Young people live in the
"smallest world," being separated from other young people and their parent's
generation via a smaller number of intermediaries than older individuals. The
oldest people live in the "least small world," being separated from their same
age peers and their younger counterparts by a larger number of intermediaries.
Variation in the small world effect is specific to age as a node attribute
(being absent in the case of gender) and is consistently observed under several
data robustness checks. The discovery of age-specific small worlds is
consistent with well-known social mechanisms affecting the way age interacts
with network connectivity and the relative prevalence of kin ties and non-kin
ties observed in this network. This social pattern has significant implications
for our understanding of generation-specific dynamics of information cascades,
diffusion phenomena, and the spread of fads and fashions.


Modeling the Interplay Between Individual Behavior and Network
  Distributions

  It is well-known that many networks follow a power-law degree distribution;
however, the factors that influence the formation of their distributions are
still unclear. How can one model the connection between individual actions and
network distributions? How can one explain the formation of group phenomena and
their evolutionary patterns?
  In this paper, we propose a unified framework, M3D, to model human dynamics
in social networks from three perspectives: macro, meso, and micro. At the
micro-level, we seek to capture the way in which an individual user decides
whether to perform an action. At the meso-level, we study how group behavior
develops and evolves over time, based on individual actions. At the
macro-level, we try to understand how network distributions such as power-law
(or heavy-tailed phenomena) can be explained by group behavior. We provide
theoretical analysis for the proposed framework, and discuss the connection of
our framework with existing work.
  The framework offers a new, flexible way to explain the interplay between
individual user actions and network distributions, and can benefit many
applications. To model heavy-tailed distributions from partially observed
individual actions and to predict the formation of group behaviors, we apply
M3D to three different genres of networks: Tencent Weibo, Citation, and Flickr.
We also use information-burst prediction as a particular application to
quantitatively evaluate the predictive power of the proposed framework. Our
results on the Weibo indicate that M3D's prediction performance exceeds that of
several alternative methods by up to 30\%.


Representing higher-order dependencies in networks

  To ensure the correctness of network analysis methods, the network (as the
input) has to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying data.
However, when representing sequential data from complex systems such as global
shipping traffic or web clickstream traffic as networks, conventional network
representations that implicitly assume the Markov property (first-order
dependency) can quickly become limiting. This assumption holds that when
movements are simulated on the network, the next movement depends only on the
current node, discounting the fact that the movement may depend on several
previous steps. However, we show that data derived from many complex systems
can show up to fifth-order dependencies. In these cases, the oversimplifying
assumption of the first-order network representation can lead to inaccurate
network analysis results. To address this problem, we propose the Higher-Order
Network (HON) representation that can discover and embed variable orders of
dependencies in a network representation. Through a comprehensive empirical
evaluation and analysis, we establish several desirable characteristics of HON,
including accuracy, scalability, and direct compatibility with the existing
suite of network analysis methods. We illustrate how HON can be applied to a
broad variety of tasks, such as random walking, clustering, and ranking, and we
demonstrate that by using it as input, HON yields more accurate results without
any modification to these tasks.


Gender Differences in Communication Behaviors, Spatial Proximity
  Patterns, and Mobility Habits

  The existence of gender differences in the structure and composition of
social networks is a well established finding in the social and behavioral
sciences, but researchers continue to debate whether structural, dispositional,
or life course factors are the primary driver of these differences. In this
paper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns of
interaction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensing
platform comprised of an ensemble of individuals' phone calls, text messaging,
face-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attempt
to isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relatively
homogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in the
life course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility data
reveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative,
distributional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly,
some patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-gender
preference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximity
context, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower
(and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women.
These findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect of
gender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication and
mobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing to
differences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles of
sociability and interaction characteristic of men and women.


Analysis of Link Formation, Persistence and Dissolution in NetSense Data

  We study a unique behavioral network data set (based on periodic surveys and
on electronic logs of dyadic contact via smartphones) collected at the
University of Notre Dame.The participants are a sample of members of the
entering class of freshmen in the fall of 2011 whose opinions on a wide variety
of political and social issues and activities on campus were regularly recorded
- at the beginning and end of each semester - for the first three years of
their residence on campus. We create a communication activity network implied
by call and text data, and a friendship network based on surveys. Both networks
are limited to students participating in the NetSense surveys. We aim at
finding student traits and activities on which agreements correlate well with
formation and persistence of links while disagreements are highly correlated
with non-existence or dissolution of links in the two social networks that we
created. Using statistical analysis and machine learning, we observe several
traits and activities displaying such correlations, thus being of potential use
to predict social network evolution.


HoNVis: Visualizing and Exploring Higher-Order Networks

  Unlike the conventional first-order network (FoN), the higher-order network
(HoN) provides a more accurate description of transitions by creating
additional nodes to encode higher-order dependencies. However, there exists no
visualization and exploration tool for the HoN. For applications such as the
development of strategies to control species invasion through global shipping
which is known to exhibit higher-order dependencies, the existing FoN
visualization tools are limited. In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel
visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the
global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple
views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the
global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of
interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order
nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is
enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global
ocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
with a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species
invasion. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of this framework to other
real-world applications such as information diffusion in social networks and
epidemic spreading through air transportation.


Will This Paper Increase Your h-index? Scientific Impact Prediction

  Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the output of
scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of scientific
impact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting
the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of
such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law
distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are
extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare.
Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked
by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: "Will
this paper increase my h-index?" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7
million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from
the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific
impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to
increase the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority
on the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are
crucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the
topic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little
relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5%
potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's
h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a
self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that
it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current
h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of
scientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more
effectively leverage their position of "standing on the shoulders of giants."


Range-limited Centrality Measures in Complex Networks

  Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in both
non-weighted and weighted directed complex networks. We introduce an efficient
method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality
based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\ell = 1,...,L$ in case of
non-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities
based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than $w_{\ell}=\ell
\Delta$, $\ell=1,2...,L=R/\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic
description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its
network neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the whole
network. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws
for large non-weighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality
measures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently
estimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the
traditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the
ranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities
quickly freezes as function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top-list
can be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest
node-to-node distance for a network of $N$ nodes, exploiting the aforementioned
scaling behavior. These observations are illustrated on model networks and on a
large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ($\sim 5.5\times 10^6$
nodes and $\sim 2.7\times 10^7$ edges). Finally, we apply these concepts to
efficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as the
smallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) and
illustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weighted
networks in detecting such backbones.


Beyond Volume: The Impact of Complex Healthcare Data on the Machine
  Learning Pipeline

  From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated
under a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and
arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from
electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to
public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of
digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for
integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple
facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to
derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to
execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on
which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant
effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data
obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is
important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In
fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare
data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted
for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on
highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct
components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes
of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations
during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model
output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates
to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose
on the efficiency of machine learning techniques.


A Deep Neural Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis
  in Multivariate Time Series Data

  Nowadays, multivariate time series data are increasingly collected in various
real world systems, e.g., power plants, wearable devices, etc. Anomaly
detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series refer to identifying
abnormal status in certain time steps and pinpointing the root causes. Building
such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture
the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the
inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the
system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of
anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the fact
that a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed,
few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a
Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform
anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically,
MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to
characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps.
Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed
to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based
Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture
the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the
inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is
used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature
matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensive
empirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant dataset
demonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.
