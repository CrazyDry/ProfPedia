Consistent Answers of Conjunctive Queries on Graphs

  During the past decade, there has been an extensive investigation of thecomputational complexity of the consistent answers of Boolean conjunctivequeries under primary key constraints. Much of this investigation has focusedon self-join-free Boolean conjunctive queries. In this paper, we study theconsistent answers of Boolean conjunctive queries involving a single binaryrelation, i.e., we consider arbitrary Boolean conjunctive queries on directedgraphs. In the presence of a single key constraint, we show that for each suchBoolean conjunctive query, either the problem of computing its consistentanswers is expressible in first-order logic, or it is polynomial-time solvable,but not expressible in first-order logic.

Computational Social Choice Meets Databases

  We develop a novel framework that aims to create bridges between thecomputational social choice and the database management communities. Thisframework enriches the tasks currently supported in computational social choicewith relational database context, thus making it possible to formulatesophisticated queries about voting rules, candidates, voters, issues, andpositions. At the conceptual level, we give rigorous semantics to queries inthis framework by introducing the notions of necessary answers and possibleanswers to queries. At the technical level, we embark on an investigation ofthe computational complexity of the necessary answers. We establish a number ofresults about the complexity of the necessary answers of conjunctive queriesinvolving positional scoring rules that contrast sharply with earlier resultsabout the complexity of the necessary winners.

On the Computational Complexity of Non-dictatorial Aggregation

  We investigate when non-dictatorial aggregation is possible from analgorithmic perspective. We consider the setting in which the members of asociety take a position on a fixed collection of issues, where for each issueseveral different alternatives are possible, but the combination of choicesmust belong to a given set $X$ of allowable voting patterns. Such a set $X$ iscalled a possibility domain if there is an aggregator that is non-dictatorial,operates separately on each issue, and returns values among those cast by thesociety on each issue. We design a polynomial-time algorithm that decides,given a set $X$ of voting patterns, whether or not $X$ is a possibility domain.Furthermore, if $X$ is a possibility domain, then the algorithm constructs inpolynomial time such a non-dictatorial aggregator for $X$. We also design apolynomial-time algorithm that decides if $X$ is a uniform possibility domain,that is, a possibility domain for which non-dictatorial aggregation ispossible, uniformly for all issues and when restricted to any two positions foreach issue. As in the case of possibility domains, the algorithm alsoconstructs in polynomial time a uniform non-dictatorial aggregator, if oneexists.

Random Graphs and the Parity Quantifier

  The classical zero-one law for first-order logic on random graphs says thatfor any first-order sentence $\phi$ in the theory of graphs, as n approachesinfinity, the probability that the random graph G(n, p) satisfies $\phi$approaches either 0 or 1. It is well known that this law fails to hold for anyformalism that can express the parity quantifier: for certain properties, theprobability that G(n, p) satisfies the property need not converge, and forothers the limit may be strictly between 0 and 1. In this paper, we capture thelimiting behavior of properties definable in first order logic augmented withthe parity quantier, FO[parity], over G(n, p), thus eluding the above hurdles.Specifically, we establish the following "modular convergence law": For everyFO[parity] sentence $\phi$, there are two rational numbers a_0, a_1, such thatfor i in {0,1}, as n approaches infinity, the probability that the random graphG(2n+i, p) satisfies $\phi$ approaches a_i. Our results also extendappropriately to first order logic equipped with Mod-q quantiers for prime q.Our approach is based on multivariate polynomials over finite fields, inparticular, on a new generalization of the Gowers norm. The proof generalizesthe original quantifier elimination approach to the zero-one law, and hasanalogies with the Razborov-Smolensky method for lower bounds for AC0 withparity gates.

The Connectivity of Boolean Satisfiability: Computational and Structural  Dichotomies

  Boolean satisfiability problems are an important benchmark for questionsabout complexity, algorithms, heuristics and threshold phenomena. Recent workon heuristics, and the satisfiability threshold has centered around thestructure and connectivity of the solution space. Motivated by this work, westudy structural and connectivity-related properties of the space of solutionsof Boolean satisfiability problems and establish various dichotomies inSchaefer's framework.  On the structural side, we obtain dichotomies for the kinds of subgraphs ofthe hypercube that can be induced by the solutions of Boolean formulas, as wellas for the diameter of the connected components of the solution space. On thecomputational side, we establish dichotomy theorems for the complexity of theconnectivity and st-connectivity questions for the graph of solutions ofBoolean formulas. Our results assert that the intractable side of thecomputational dichotomies is PSPACE-complete, while the tractable side - whichincludes but is not limited to all problems with polynomial time algorithms forsatisfiability - is in P for the st-connectivity question, and in coNP for theconnectivity question. The diameter of components can be exponential for thePSPACE-complete cases, whereas in all other cases it is linear; thus, smalldiameter and tractability of the connectivity problems are remarkably aligned.The crux of our results is an expressibility theorem showing that in thetractable cases, the subgraphs induced by the solution space possess certaingood structural properties, whereas in the intractable cases, the subgraphs canbe arbitrary.

Exchange-Repairs: Managing Inconsistency in Data Exchange

  In a data exchange setting with target constraints, it is often the case thata given source instance has no solutions. In such cases, the semantics oftarget queries trivialize. The aim of this paper is to introduce and explore anew framework that gives meaningful semantics in such cases by using the notionof exchange-repairs. Informally, an exchange-repair of a source instance isanother source instance that differs minimally from the first, but has asolution. Exchange-repairs give rise to a natural notion of exchange-repaircertain answers (XR-certain answers) for target queries. We show that forschema mappings specified by source-to-target GAV dependencies and targetequality-generating dependencies (egds), the XR-certain answers of a targetconjunctive query can be rewritten as the consistent answers (in the sense ofstandard database repairs) of a union of conjunctive queries over the sourceschema with respect to a set of egds over the source schema, making it possibleto use a consistent query-answering system to compute XR-certain answers indata exchange. We then examine the general case of schema mappings specified bysource-to-target GLAV constraints, a weakly acyclic set of target tgds and aset of target egds. The main result asserts that, for such settings, theXR-certain answers of conjunctive queries can be rewritten as the certainanswers of a union of conjunctive queries with respect to the stable models ofa disjunctive logic program over a suitable expansion of the source schema.

Generalized Satisfiability Problems via Operator Assignments

  Schaefer introduced a framework for generalized satisfiability problems onthe Boolean domain and characterized the computational complexity of suchproblems. We investigate an algebraization of Schaefer's framework in which theFourier transform is used to represent constraints by multilinear polynomialsin a unique way. The polynomial representation of constraints gives rise to arelaxation of the notion of satisfiability in which the values to variables arelinear operators on some Hilbert space. For the case of constraints given by asystem of linear equations over the two-element field, this relaxation hasreceived considerable attention in the foundations of quantum mechanics, wheresuch constructions as the Mermin-Peres magic square show that there are systemsthat have no solutions in the Boolean domain, but have solutions via operatorassignments on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain a completecharacterization of the classes of Boolean relations for which there is a gapbetween satisfiability in the Boolean domain and the relaxation ofsatisfiability via operator assignments. To establish our main result, we adaptthe notion of primitive-positive definability (pp-definability) to our setting,a notion that has been used extensively in the study of constraint satisfactionproblems. Here, we show that pp-definability gives rise to gadget reductionsthat preserve satisfiability gaps. We also present several additionalapplications of this method. In particular and perhaps surprisingly, we showthat the relaxed notion of pp-definability in which the quantified variablesare allowed to range over operator assignments gives no additional expressivepower in defining Boolean relations.

Knowledge Refinement via Rule Selection

  In several different applications, including data transformation and entityresolution, rules are used to capture aspects of knowledge about theapplication at hand. Often, a large set of such rules is generatedautomatically or semi-automatically, and the challenge is to refine theencapsulated knowledge by selecting a subset of rules based on the expectedoperational behavior of the rules on available data. In this paper, we carryout a systematic complexity-theoretic investigation of the following ruleselection problem: given a set of rules specified by Horn formulas, and a pairof an input database and an output database, find a subset of the rules thatminimizes the total error, that is, the number of false positive and falsenegative errors arising from the selected rules. We first establishcomputational hardness results for the decision problems underlying thisminimization problem, as well as upper and lower bounds for itsapproximability. We then investigate a bi-objective optimization version of therule selection problem in which both the total error and the size of theselected rules are taken into account. We show that testing for membership inthe Pareto front of this bi-objective optimization problem is DP-complete.Finally, we show that a similar DP-completeness result holds for a bi-leveloptimization version of the rule selection problem, where one minimizes firstthe total error and then the size.

Aggregation of Votes with Multiple Positions on Each Issue

  We consider the problem of aggregating votes cast by a society on a fixed setof issues, where each member of the society may vote for one of severalpositions on each issue, but the combination of votes on the various issues isrestricted to a set of feasible voting patterns. We require the aggregation tobe supportive, i.e. for every issue $j$ the corresponding component $f_j$ ofevery aggregator on every issue should satisfy $f_j(x_1, ,\ldots, x_n) \in\{x_1, ,\ldots, x_n\}$. We prove that, in such a set-up, non-dictatorialaggregation of votes in a society of some size is possible if and only ifeither non-dictatorial aggregation is possible in a society of only two membersor a ternary aggregator exists that either on every issue $j$ is a majorityoperation, i.e. the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x)= f_j(y,x,x) =x, \forall x,y$, or on every issue is a minority operation, i.e.the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x) = f_j(y,x,x) =y,\forall x,y.$ We then introduce a notion of uniformly non-dictatorialaggregator, which is defined to be an aggregator that on every issue, and whenrestricted to an arbitrary two-element subset of the votes for that issue,differs from all projection functions. We first give a characterization of setsof feasible voting patterns that admit a uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator.Then making use of Bulatov's dichotomy theorem for conservative constraintsatisfaction problems, we connect social choice theory with combinatorialcomplexity by proving that if a set of feasible voting patterns $X$ has auniformly non-dictatorial aggregator of some arity then the multi-sortedconservative constraint satisfaction problem on $X$, in the sense introduced byBulatov and Jeavons, with each issue representing a sort, is tractable;otherwise it is NP-complete.
