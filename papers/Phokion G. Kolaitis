Consistent Answers of Conjunctive Queries on Graphs

  During the past decade, there has been an extensive investigation of the
computational complexity of the consistent answers of Boolean conjunctive
queries under primary key constraints. Much of this investigation has focused
on self-join-free Boolean conjunctive queries. In this paper, we study the
consistent answers of Boolean conjunctive queries involving a single binary
relation, i.e., we consider arbitrary Boolean conjunctive queries on directed
graphs. In the presence of a single key constraint, we show that for each such
Boolean conjunctive query, either the problem of computing its consistent
answers is expressible in first-order logic, or it is polynomial-time solvable,
but not expressible in first-order logic.


Computational Social Choice Meets Databases

  We develop a novel framework that aims to create bridges between the
computational social choice and the database management communities. This
framework enriches the tasks currently supported in computational social choice
with relational database context, thus making it possible to formulate
sophisticated queries about voting rules, candidates, voters, issues, and
positions. At the conceptual level, we give rigorous semantics to queries in
this framework by introducing the notions of necessary answers and possible
answers to queries. At the technical level, we embark on an investigation of
the computational complexity of the necessary answers. We establish a number of
results about the complexity of the necessary answers of conjunctive queries
involving positional scoring rules that contrast sharply with earlier results
about the complexity of the necessary winners.


On the Computational Complexity of Non-dictatorial Aggregation

  We investigate when non-dictatorial aggregation is possible from an
algorithmic perspective. We consider the setting in which the members of a
society take a position on a fixed collection of issues, where for each issue
several different alternatives are possible, but the combination of choices
must belong to a given set $X$ of allowable voting patterns. Such a set $X$ is
called a possibility domain if there is an aggregator that is non-dictatorial,
operates separately on each issue, and returns values among those cast by the
society on each issue. We design a polynomial-time algorithm that decides,
given a set $X$ of voting patterns, whether or not $X$ is a possibility domain.
Furthermore, if $X$ is a possibility domain, then the algorithm constructs in
polynomial time such a non-dictatorial aggregator for $X$. We also design a
polynomial-time algorithm that decides if $X$ is a uniform possibility domain,
that is, a possibility domain for which non-dictatorial aggregation is
possible, uniformly for all issues and when restricted to any two positions for
each issue. As in the case of possibility domains, the algorithm also
constructs in polynomial time a uniform non-dictatorial aggregator, if one
exists.


Random Graphs and the Parity Quantifier

  The classical zero-one law for first-order logic on random graphs says that
for any first-order sentence $\phi$ in the theory of graphs, as n approaches
infinity, the probability that the random graph G(n, p) satisfies $\phi$
approaches either 0 or 1. It is well known that this law fails to hold for any
formalism that can express the parity quantifier: for certain properties, the
probability that G(n, p) satisfies the property need not converge, and for
others the limit may be strictly between 0 and 1. In this paper, we capture the
limiting behavior of properties definable in first order logic augmented with
the parity quantier, FO[parity], over G(n, p), thus eluding the above hurdles.
Specifically, we establish the following "modular convergence law": For every
FO[parity] sentence $\phi$, there are two rational numbers a_0, a_1, such that
for i in {0,1}, as n approaches infinity, the probability that the random graph
G(2n+i, p) satisfies $\phi$ approaches a_i. Our results also extend
appropriately to first order logic equipped with Mod-q quantiers for prime q.
Our approach is based on multivariate polynomials over finite fields, in
particular, on a new generalization of the Gowers norm. The proof generalizes
the original quantifier elimination approach to the zero-one law, and has
analogies with the Razborov-Smolensky method for lower bounds for AC0 with
parity gates.


The Connectivity of Boolean Satisfiability: Computational and Structural
  Dichotomies

  Boolean satisfiability problems are an important benchmark for questions
about complexity, algorithms, heuristics and threshold phenomena. Recent work
on heuristics, and the satisfiability threshold has centered around the
structure and connectivity of the solution space. Motivated by this work, we
study structural and connectivity-related properties of the space of solutions
of Boolean satisfiability problems and establish various dichotomies in
Schaefer's framework.
  On the structural side, we obtain dichotomies for the kinds of subgraphs of
the hypercube that can be induced by the solutions of Boolean formulas, as well
as for the diameter of the connected components of the solution space. On the
computational side, we establish dichotomy theorems for the complexity of the
connectivity and st-connectivity questions for the graph of solutions of
Boolean formulas. Our results assert that the intractable side of the
computational dichotomies is PSPACE-complete, while the tractable side - which
includes but is not limited to all problems with polynomial time algorithms for
satisfiability - is in P for the st-connectivity question, and in coNP for the
connectivity question. The diameter of components can be exponential for the
PSPACE-complete cases, whereas in all other cases it is linear; thus, small
diameter and tractability of the connectivity problems are remarkably aligned.
The crux of our results is an expressibility theorem showing that in the
tractable cases, the subgraphs induced by the solution space possess certain
good structural properties, whereas in the intractable cases, the subgraphs can
be arbitrary.


Generalized Satisfiability Problems via Operator Assignments

  Schaefer introduced a framework for generalized satisfiability problems on
the Boolean domain and characterized the computational complexity of such
problems. We investigate an algebraization of Schaefer's framework in which the
Fourier transform is used to represent constraints by multilinear polynomials
in a unique way. The polynomial representation of constraints gives rise to a
relaxation of the notion of satisfiability in which the values to variables are
linear operators on some Hilbert space. For the case of constraints given by a
system of linear equations over the two-element field, this relaxation has
received considerable attention in the foundations of quantum mechanics, where
such constructions as the Mermin-Peres magic square show that there are systems
that have no solutions in the Boolean domain, but have solutions via operator
assignments on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain a complete
characterization of the classes of Boolean relations for which there is a gap
between satisfiability in the Boolean domain and the relaxation of
satisfiability via operator assignments. To establish our main result, we adapt
the notion of primitive-positive definability (pp-definability) to our setting,
a notion that has been used extensively in the study of constraint satisfaction
problems. Here, we show that pp-definability gives rise to gadget reductions
that preserve satisfiability gaps. We also present several additional
applications of this method. In particular and perhaps surprisingly, we show
that the relaxed notion of pp-definability in which the quantified variables
are allowed to range over operator assignments gives no additional expressive
power in defining Boolean relations.


Exchange-Repairs: Managing Inconsistency in Data Exchange

  In a data exchange setting with target constraints, it is often the case that
a given source instance has no solutions. In such cases, the semantics of
target queries trivialize. The aim of this paper is to introduce and explore a
new framework that gives meaningful semantics in such cases by using the notion
of exchange-repairs. Informally, an exchange-repair of a source instance is
another source instance that differs minimally from the first, but has a
solution. Exchange-repairs give rise to a natural notion of exchange-repair
certain answers (XR-certain answers) for target queries. We show that for
schema mappings specified by source-to-target GAV dependencies and target
equality-generating dependencies (egds), the XR-certain answers of a target
conjunctive query can be rewritten as the consistent answers (in the sense of
standard database repairs) of a union of conjunctive queries over the source
schema with respect to a set of egds over the source schema, making it possible
to use a consistent query-answering system to compute XR-certain answers in
data exchange. We then examine the general case of schema mappings specified by
source-to-target GLAV constraints, a weakly acyclic set of target tgds and a
set of target egds. The main result asserts that, for such settings, the
XR-certain answers of conjunctive queries can be rewritten as the certain
answers of a union of conjunctive queries with respect to the stable models of
a disjunctive logic program over a suitable expansion of the source schema.


Knowledge Refinement via Rule Selection

  In several different applications, including data transformation and entity
resolution, rules are used to capture aspects of knowledge about the
application at hand. Often, a large set of such rules is generated
automatically or semi-automatically, and the challenge is to refine the
encapsulated knowledge by selecting a subset of rules based on the expected
operational behavior of the rules on available data. In this paper, we carry
out a systematic complexity-theoretic investigation of the following rule
selection problem: given a set of rules specified by Horn formulas, and a pair
of an input database and an output database, find a subset of the rules that
minimizes the total error, that is, the number of false positive and false
negative errors arising from the selected rules. We first establish
computational hardness results for the decision problems underlying this
minimization problem, as well as upper and lower bounds for its
approximability. We then investigate a bi-objective optimization version of the
rule selection problem in which both the total error and the size of the
selected rules are taken into account. We show that testing for membership in
the Pareto front of this bi-objective optimization problem is DP-complete.
Finally, we show that a similar DP-completeness result holds for a bi-level
optimization version of the rule selection problem, where one minimizes first
the total error and then the size.


Aggregation of Votes with Multiple Positions on Each Issue

  We consider the problem of aggregating votes cast by a society on a fixed set
of issues, where each member of the society may vote for one of several
positions on each issue, but the combination of votes on the various issues is
restricted to a set of feasible voting patterns. We require the aggregation to
be supportive, i.e. for every issue $j$ the corresponding component $f_j$ of
every aggregator on every issue should satisfy $f_j(x_1, ,\ldots, x_n) \in
\{x_1, ,\ldots, x_n\}$. We prove that, in such a set-up, non-dictatorial
aggregation of votes in a society of some size is possible if and only if
either non-dictatorial aggregation is possible in a society of only two members
or a ternary aggregator exists that either on every issue $j$ is a majority
operation, i.e. the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x)
= f_j(y,x,x) =x, \forall x,y$, or on every issue is a minority operation, i.e.
the corresponding component satisfies $f_j(x,x,y) = f_j(x,y,x) = f_j(y,x,x) =y,
\forall x,y.$ We then introduce a notion of uniformly non-dictatorial
aggregator, which is defined to be an aggregator that on every issue, and when
restricted to an arbitrary two-element subset of the votes for that issue,
differs from all projection functions. We first give a characterization of sets
of feasible voting patterns that admit a uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator.
Then making use of Bulatov's dichotomy theorem for conservative constraint
satisfaction problems, we connect social choice theory with combinatorial
complexity by proving that if a set of feasible voting patterns $X$ has a
uniformly non-dictatorial aggregator of some arity then the multi-sorted
conservative constraint satisfaction problem on $X$, in the sense introduced by
Bulatov and Jeavons, with each issue representing a sort, is tractable;
otherwise it is NP-complete.
