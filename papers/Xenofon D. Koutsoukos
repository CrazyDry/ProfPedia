Resilient Supervisory Control of Autonomous Intersections in the  Presence of Sensor Attacks

  Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles crossing anintersection, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and their safety-critical naturemakes them a target for malicious adversaries. This paper studies the problemof supervisory control of autonomous intersections in the presence of sensorattacks. Sensor attacks are performed when an adversary gains access to thetransmission channel and corrupts the measurements before they are received bythe decision-making unit. We show that the supervisory control system isvulnerable to sensor attacks that can cause collision or deadlock amongvehicles. To improve the system resilience, we introduce a detector in thecontrol architecture and focus on stealthy attacks that cannot be detected butare capable of compromising safety. We then present a resilient supervisorycontrol system that is safe, non-deadlocking, and maximally permissive, despitethe presence of disturbances, uncontrolled vehicles, and sensor attacks.Finally, we demonstrate how the resilient supervisor works by consideringillustrative examples.
