Assessing the Utility of Weather Data for Photovoltaic Power Prediction

  Photovoltaic systems have been widely deployed in recent times to meet theincreased electricity demand as an environmental-friendly energy source. Themajor challenge for integrating photovoltaic systems in power systems is theunpredictability of the solar power generated. In this paper, we analyze theimpact of having access to weather information for solar power generationprediction and find weather information that can help best predict photovoltaicpower.

Fake News: A Survey of Research, Detection Methods, and Opportunities

  The explosive growth in fake news and its erosion to democracy, justice, andpublic trust has increased the demand for fake news analysis, detection andintervention. This survey comprehensively and systematically reviews fake newsresearch. The survey identifies and specifies fundamental theories acrossvarious disciplines, e.g., psychology and social science, to facilitate andenhance the interdisciplinary research of fake news. Current fake news researchis reviewed, summarized and evaluated. These studies focus on fake news fromfour perspective: (1) the false knowledge it carries, (2) its writing style,(3) its propagation patterns, and (4) the credibility of its creators andspreaders. We characterize each perspective with various analyzable andutilizable information provided by news and its spreaders, various strategiesand frameworks that are adaptable, and techniques that are applicable. Byreviewing the characteristics of fake news and open issues in fake newsstudies, we highlight some potential research tasks at the end of this survey.
