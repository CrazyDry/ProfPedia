Assessing the Utility of Weather Data for Photovoltaic Power Prediction

  Photovoltaic systems have been widely deployed in recent times to meet the
increased electricity demand as an environmental-friendly energy source. The
major challenge for integrating photovoltaic systems in power systems is the
unpredictability of the solar power generated. In this paper, we analyze the
impact of having access to weather information for solar power generation
prediction and find weather information that can help best predict photovoltaic
power.


Fake News: A Survey of Research, Detection Methods, and Opportunities

  The explosive growth in fake news and its erosion to democracy, justice, and
public trust has increased the demand for fake news analysis, detection and
intervention. This survey comprehensively and systematically reviews fake news
research. The survey identifies and specifies fundamental theories across
various disciplines, e.g., psychology and social science, to facilitate and
enhance the interdisciplinary research of fake news. Current fake news research
is reviewed, summarized and evaluated. These studies focus on fake news from
four perspective: (1) the false knowledge it carries, (2) its writing style,
(3) its propagation patterns, and (4) the credibility of its creators and
spreaders. We characterize each perspective with various analyzable and
utilizable information provided by news and its spreaders, various strategies
and frameworks that are adaptable, and techniques that are applicable. By
reviewing the characteristics of fake news and open issues in fake news
studies, we highlight some potential research tasks at the end of this survey.
