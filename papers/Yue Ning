Network Extreme Eigenvalue - from Multimodal to Scale-free Network

  The extreme eigenvalues of adjacency matrices are important indicators on theinfluences of topological structures to collective dynamical behavior ofcomplex networks. Recent findings on the ensemble averageability of the extremeeigenvalue further authenticate its sensibility in the study of networkdynamics. Here we determine the ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalue andcharacterize the deviation across the ensemble through the discrete form ofrandom scale-free network. Remarkably, the analytical approximation derivedfrom the discrete form shows significant improvement over the previous results.This has also led us to the same conclusion as [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 248701(2007)] that deviation in the reduced extreme eigenvalues vanishes as thenetwork size grows.

Spectral Anlysis on Explosive Percolation

  We study the spectral properties of the process of explosive percolation. Inparticular, we explore how the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of anetwork which governs the spreading efficiency evolves as the density ofconnection increases. Interestingly, for networks with connectivity that growin an explosive way, information spreading and mass transport are found to becarried out inefficiently. In the conventional explosive percolation modelsthat we studied, the sudden emergences of large-scale connectivity are found tocome with relatively lowered efficiency of spreading. Nevertheless, thespreading efficiency of the explosive model can be increased by introducingheterogeneous structures into the networks.

Critical Transitions in Public Opinion: A Case Study of American  Presidential Election

  At the tipping point, it is known that small incident can trigger dramaticsocietal shift. Getting early-warning signals for such changes are valuable toavoid detrimental outcomes such as riots or collapses of nations. However, itis notoriously hard to capture the processes of such transitions in thereal-world. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of a major shift in publicopinion in the form of political support. Instead of simple swapping of rulingparties, we study the regime shift of a party popularity based on itsattractiveness by examining the American presidential elections during1980-2012. A single irreversible transition is detected in 1991. Once atransition happens, recovery to the original level of attractiveness does notbring popularity of the political party back. Remarkably, this transition iscorroborated by tell-tale early-warning signature of critical slowing down. Ourapproach is applicable to shifts in public attitude within any social system.

A New Reduced-Rank Linear Discriminant Analysis Method and Its  Applications

  We consider multi-class classification problems for high dimensional data.Following the idea of reduced-rank linear discriminant analysis (LDA), weintroduce a new dimension reduction tool with a flavor of supervised principalcomponent analysis (PCA). The proposed method is computationally efficient andcan incorporate the correlation structure among the features. Besides thetheoretical insights, we show that our method is a competitive classificationtool by simulated and real data examples.

Spin Path Integral And Quantum Mechanics In Rotating Reference of Frame

  We developed a path integral formalism for the quantum mechanics in arotating reference of frame, and proposed a spin path integral description forthe spin degrees of freedom in it. We have also give some examples for theapplications of our foramlism.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity of  Borophene

  The present work carries out molecular dynamics simulations to compute thethermal conductivity of the borophene nanoribbon and the borophene nanotubeusing the Muller-Plathe approach. We investigate the thermal conductivity ofthe armchair and zigzag borophenes, and show the strong anisotropic thermalconductivity property of borophene. We compare the results of the borophenenanoribbon and the borophene nanotube, and find the thermal conductivity of theborophene is structure dependent.

Modeling Precursors for Event Forecasting via Nested Multi-Instance  Learning

  Forecasting events like civil unrest movements, disease outbreaks, financialmarket movements and government elections from open source indicators such asnews feeds and social media streams is an important and challenging problem.From the perspective of human analysts and policy makers, forecastingalgorithms need to provide supporting evidence and identify the causes relatedto the event of interest. We develop a novel multiple instance learning basedapproach that jointly tackles the problem of identifying evidence-basedprecursors and forecasts events into the future. Specifically, given acollection of streaming news articles from multiple sources we develop a nestedmultiple instance learning approach to forecast significant societal eventsacross three countries in Latin America. Our algorithm is able to identify newsarticles considered as precursors for a protest. Our empirical evaluation showsthe strengths of our proposed approaches in filtering candidate precursors,forecasting the occurrence of events with a lead time and predicting thecharacteristics of different events in comparison to several otherformulations. We demonstrate through case studies the effectiveness of ourproposed model in filtering the candidate precursors for inspection by a humananalyst.

Fully Computable Error Bounds for Eigenvalue Problem

  This paper is concerned with the computable error estimates for theeigenvalue problem which is solved by the general conforming finite elementmethods on the general meshes. Based on the computable error estimate, we cangive an asymptotically lower bound of the general eigenvalues. Furthermore, wealso give a guaranteed upper bound of the error estimates for the firsteigenfunction approximation and a guaranteed lower bound of the firsteigenvalue based on computable error estimator. Some numerical examples arepresented to validate the theoretical results deduced in this paper.

Epidemic spreading induced by diversity of agents' mobility

  In this paper, we study into the impact of the preference of an individualfor public transport on the spread of infectious disease, through a quantityknown as the public mobility. Our theoretical and numerical results based on aconstructed model reveal that if the average public mobility of the agents isfixed, an increase in the diversity of the agents' public mobility reduces theepidemic threshold, beyond which an enhancement in the rate of infection isobserved. Our findings provide an approach to improve the resistance of asociety against infectious disease, while preserving the utilization rate ofthe public transportation system.

Multiple Change-point Detection: a Selective Overview

  Very long and noisy sequence data arise from biological sciences to socialscience including high throughput data in genomics and stock prices ineconometrics. Often such data are collected in order to identify and understandshifts in trend, e.g., from a bull market to a bear market in finance or from anormal number of chromosome copies to an excessive number of chromosome copiesin genetics. Thus, identifying multiple change points in a long, possibly verylong, sequence is an important problem. In this article, we review bothclassical and new multiple change-point detection strategies. Considering thelong history and the extensive literature on the change-point detection, weprovide an in-depth discussion on a normal mean change-point model from aspectsof regression analysis, hypothesis testing, consistency and inference. Inparticular, we present a strategy to gather and aggregate local information forchange-point detection that has become the cornerstone of several emergingmethods because of its attractiveness in both computational and theoreticalproperties.

YouTube-VOS: A Large-Scale Video Object Segmentation Benchmark

  Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many videoanalysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly relyon static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporaldependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models,leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learningto explore spatialtemporal features for video segmentation is largely limitedby the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largestvideo segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve thisproblem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset calledYouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains4,453 YouTube video clips and 94 object categories. This is by far the largestvideo object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and has been released athttp://youtube-vos.org. We further evaluate several existing state-of-the-artvideo object segmentation algorithms on this dataset which aims to establishbaselines for the development of new algorithms in the future.

Bus bunching as a synchronisation phenomenon

  Bus bunching is a perennial phenomenon that not only diminishes theefficiency of a bus system, but also prevents transit authorities from keepingbuses on schedule. We present a physical theory of buses serving a loop of busstops as a ring of coupled self-oscillators, analogous to the Kuramoto model.Sustained bunching is a repercussion of the process of phase synchronisationwhereby the phases of the oscillators are locked to each other. This emergeswhen demand exceeds a critical threshold. Buses also bunch at low demand,albeit temporarily, due to frequency detuning arising from different humandrivers' distinct natural speeds. We calculate the critical transition when\emph{complete phase locking} (full synchronisation) occurs for the bus system,and posit the critical transition to \emph{completely no phase locking} (zerosynchronisation). The intermediate regime comprising \emph{chimera states} isthe phase where clusters of partially phase locked buses exist. Intriguingly,these theoretical results are in close correspondence to real buses in auniversity's shuttle bus system.

YouTube-VOS: Sequence-to-Sequence Video Object Segmentation

  Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many videoanalysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly relyon static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporaldependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models,leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learningto explore spatial-temporal features for video segmentation is largely limitedby the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largestvideo segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve thisproblem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset calledYouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains3,252 YouTube video clips and 78 categories including common objects and humanactivities. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to ourknowledge and we have released it at https://youtube-vos.org. Based on thisdataset, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence network to fully exploitlong-term spatial-temporal information in videos for segmentation. Wedemonstrate that our method is able to achieve the best results on ourYouTube-VOS test set and comparable results on DAVIS 2016 compared to thecurrent state-of-the-art methods. Experiments show that the large scale datasetis indeed a key factor to the success of our model.

An Electric Vehicle Charging Management Scheme Based on  Publish/Subscribe Communication Framework

  Motivated by alleviating CO$_2$ pollution, Electric Vehicle (EV) basedapplications have recently received wide interests from both commercial andresearch communities by using electric energy instead of traditional fuelenergy. Although EVs are inherently with limited travelling distance, suchlimitation could be overcome by deploying public Charging Stations (CSs) torecharge EVs battery during their journeys. In this paper we propose a novelcommunication framework for on-the-move EV charging scenario, based on thePublish/Subscribe (P/S) mechanism for disseminating necessary CS information toEVs, in order for them to make optimized decisions on where to charge. A corepart of our communication framework is the utilization of Road Side Units(RSUs) to bridge the information flow from CSs to EVs, which has been regardedas a type of cost-efficient communication infrastructure. Under this design, weintroduce two complementary communication modes of signalling protocols, namelyPush and Pull Modes, in order to enable the required information disseminationoperation. Both analysis and simulation show the advantage of Pull Mode, inwhich the information is cached at RSUs to support asynchronous communication.We further propose a remote reservation service based on the Pull Mode, suchthat the CS-selection decision making can utilize the knowledge of EVs'charging reservation, as published from EVs through RSUs to CSs. Results showthat both the performance at CS and EV sides are further improved based onusing this anticipated information.

Dark matter direct search sensitivity of the PandaX-4T experiment

  The PandaX-4T experiment, a four-ton scale dark matter direct detectionexperiment, is being planned at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. Inthis paper we present a simulation study of the expected background in thisexperiment. In a 2.8-ton fiducial mass and the signal region between 1 to 10keV electron equivalent energy, the total electron recoil background is foundto be 4.9x10^{-5} /(kg day keV). The nuclear recoil background in the sameregion is 2.8x10^{-7}/(kg day keV). With an exposure of 5.6 ton-years, thesensitivity of PandaX-4T could reach a minimum spin-independent darkmatter-nucleon cross section of 6x10^{-48} cm^{2} at a dark matter mass of 40GeV/c^{2}.

PandaX-II Constraints on Spin-Dependent WIMP-Nucleon Effective  Interactions

  We present PandaX-II constraints on candidate WIMP-nucleon effectiveinteractions involving the nucleon or WIMP spin, including, in addition tostandard axial spin-dependent (SD) scattering, various couplings among vectorand axial currents, magnetic and electric dipole moments, and tensorinteractions. The data set corresponding to a total exposure of 54-ton-days isreanalyzed to determine constraints as a function of the WIMP mass and isospincoupling. We obtain WIMP-nucleon cross section bounds of $\rm 1.6 \times10^{-41} cm^2$ and $\rm 9.0 \times 10^{-42} cm^2$ ($90\%$ c.l.) forneutron-only SD and tensor coupling, respectively, for a mass $M_\mathrm{WIMP}\sim {\rm 40~GeV}/c^2$. The SD limits are the best currently available for$M_\mathrm{WIMP} > {\rm 40~GeV}/c^2$. We show that PandaX-II has reached asensitivity sufficient to probe a variety of other candidate spin-dependentinteractions at the weak scale.

Generating Realistic Synthetic Population Datasets

  Modern studies of societal phenomena rely on the availability of largedatasets capturing attributes and activities of synthetic, city-level,populations. For instance, in epidemiology, synthetic population datasets arenecessary to study disease propagation and intervention measures beforeimplementation. In social science, synthetic population datasets are needed tounderstand how policy decisions might affect preferences and behaviors ofindividuals. In public health, synthetic population datasets are necessary tocapture diagnostic and procedural characteristics of patient records withoutviolating confidentialities of individuals. To generate such datasets over alarge set of categorical variables, we propose the use of the maximum entropyprinciple to formalize a generative model such that in a statisticallywell-founded way we can optimally utilize given prior information about thedata, and are unbiased otherwise. An efficient inference algorithm is designedto estimate the maximum entropy model, and we demonstrate how our approach isadept at estimating underlying data distributions. We evaluate this approachagainst both simulated data and on US census datasets, and demonstrate itsfeasibility using an epidemic simulation application.

Phase-locked array of quantum cascade lasers with an intracavity spatial  filter

  Phase-locking an array of quantum cascade lasers is an effective way toachieve higher output power and beam shaping. In this article, based on Talboteffect, we show a new-type phase-locked array of mid-infrared quantum cascadelasers with an integrated spatial- filtering Talbot cavity. All the arrays showstable in-phase operation from the threshold current to full power current. Thebeam divergence of the array device is smaller than that of a single-ridgelaser. We use the multi-slit Fraunhofer diffraction mode to interpret thefar-field radiation profile and give a solution to get better beam quality. Themaximum power is just about 5 times that of a single-ridge laser foreleven-laser array device and 3 times for seven-laser array device. Consideringthe great modal selection ability, simple fabricating process and the potentialfor achieving better beam quality and smaller cavity loss, this new-typephase-locked array may be a hopeful and elegant solution to get high power orbeam shaping.

One-step synthesis of van der Waals heterostructures of graphene and 2D  superconducting a-Mo2C

  Assembling different two-dimensional (2D) crystals, covering a very broadrange of properties, into van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures enables theunprecedented possibilities for combining the best of different ingredients inone objective material. So far, metallic, semiconducting, and insulating 2Dcrystals have been used successfully in making functional vdW heterostructureswith properties by design. Here, we expand 2D superconducting crystals as abuilding block of the vdW hererostructures. A one-step growth of large-scalehigh-quality vdW heterostructures of graphene and 2D superconducting a-Mo2C byusing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is reported. The superconductivityand its 2D nature of the heterostructures are characterized by our scanningtunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. This adds the 2D superconductivity,the most attractive property of condensed matter physics, to the vdWheterostructures.

Initial Cell Search and Selection for Load Balancing and Throughput  Optimization in 5G Millimeter Wave Networks

  The increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires carefuldesign and optimization of the next-generation mobile networks (a.k.a. 5G) inevery aspect to efficiently cope with the diverse and wide range of IoTrequirements. Initial cell search and selection is one of the first fewessential steps that a mobile device must perform to access a mobile network.The distinct features of 5G bring new challenges to the design of initial cellsearch and selection. In this paper, we propose a load aware initial cellsearch and selection scheme for 5G millimeter wave networks. The proposedscheme augments the existing pure received power based scheme by incorporatinga new load factor broadcast as part of system information. We then formulate athroughput optimization problem using the optimal stopping theory. Wecharacterize the throughput optimal stopping strategy and the attained maximumthroughput. The results show that the proposed initial cell search andselection scheme is throughput optimal with a carefully optimized connectionthreshold.

Exploring the dark matter inelastic frontier with 79.6 days of PandaX-II  data

  We report here the results of searching for inelastic scattering of darkmatter (initial and final state dark matter particles differ by a small masssplitting) with nucleon with the first 79.6-day of PandaX-II data (Run 9). Weset the upper limits for the spin independent WIMP-nucleon scattering crosssection up to a mass splitting of 300 keV/c$^2$ at two benchmark dark mattermasses of 1 and 10 TeV/c$^2$.

Dark Matter Results From 54-Ton-Day Exposure of PandaX-II Experiment

  We report a new search of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) usingthe combined low background data sets in 2016 and 2017 from the PandaX-IIexperiment in China. The latest data set contains a new exposure of 77.1 liveday, with the background reduced to a level of 0.8$\times10^{-3}$ evt/kg/day,improved by a factor of 2.5 in comparison to the previous run in 2016. Noexcess events were found above the expected background. With a total exposureof 5.4$\times10^4$ kg day, the most stringent upper limit on spin-independentWIMP-nucleon cross section was set for a WIMP with mass larger than 100GeV/c$^2$, with the lowest exclusion at 8.6$\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$ at 40GeV/c$^2$.

Constraining Dark Matter Models with a Light Mediator from PandaX-II  Experiment

  We search for nuclear recoil signals of dark matter models with a lightmediator in PandaX-II, a direct detection experiment in China Jinpingunderground Laboratory. Using data collected in 2016 and 2017 runs,corresponding to a total exposure of 54 ton day, we set upper limits on thezero-momentum dark matter-nucleon cross section. These limits have a strongdependence on the mediator mass when it is comparable to or below the typicalmomentum transfer. We apply our results to constrain self-interacting darkmatter models with a light mediator mixing with standard model particles, andset strong limits on the model parameter space for the dark matter mass rangingfrom $5~{\rm GeV}$ to $10~{\rm TeV}$.

Phase-locked array of quantum cascade lasers with an integrated Talbot  cavity

  We show a phase-locked array of three quantum cascade lasers with anintegrated Talbot cavity at one side of the laser array. The coupling scheme iscalled diffraction coupling. By controlling the length of Talbot to be aquarter of Talbot distance (Zt/4), in-phase mode operation can be selected. Thein-phase operation shows great modal stability under different injectioncurrents, from the threshold current to the full power current. The far-fieldradiation pattern of the in-phase operation contains three lobes, one centralmaximum lobe and two side lobes. The interval between adjacent lobes is about10.5{\deg}. The output power is about 1.5 times that of a single-ridge laser.Further studies should be taken to achieve better beam performance and reduceoptical losses brought by the integrated Talbot cavity.

Implications of CP-violating Top-Higgs Couplings at LHC and Higgs  Factories

  We utilise the LHC Run-1 and -2 Higgs data to constrain the CP-violatingtop-Higgs couplings. In order to satisfy the current full Higgs data sets at$2\sigma$ level, the CP-odd component $C^p_t$ and the CP-even component $C^s_t$have to be within the ranges $|C^p_t|< 0.37$ and $0.85 <C^s_t< 1.20$,respectively, which is stronger than the LHC Run-1 bound $|C^p_t|< 0.54$ and$0.68 <C^s_t< 1.20$. With the new bound, we explore the impact on theCP-violating top-Higgs couplings in the Higgs production processes $pp \tot\bar{t}h, thj, hh$ at 13 TeV LHC, and $e^+e^- \to hZ, h\gamma$ at future 240GeV Higgs factories. We find that the cross sections of $pp \to t\bar{t}h$, $pp\to thj$, $pp \to hh$, $e^+e^- \to hZ$ and $e^+e^- \to h\gamma$ can be enhancedup to 1.41, 1.18, 2.20, 1.001 and 1.09 times as large as the SM predictions,respectively. The future precision measurement of the process $e^+e^- \toh\gamma$ with an accuracy of 5\% will be able to constrain $|C^p_t|<0.19$ atmost at a 240 GeV $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory.

Relativistic, single-cycle tunable-infrared pulses generated by a  tailored plasma density structure

  The availability of intense, ultrashort coherent radiation sources in theinfrared region of the spectrum is enabling the generation of attosecond X-raypulses via high harmonic generation, pump-probe experiments in the "molecularfingerprint" region and opening up the area of relativistic-infrared nonlinearoptics of plasmas. These applications would benefit from multi-millijoulesingle-cycle pulses in the mid to long wavelength infrared (LW-IR) region. Herewe present a new scheme capable of producing tunable relativistically intense,single-cycle infrared pulses from 5-14$\mu$m with a 1.7% conversion efficiencybased on a photon frequency downshifting scheme that uses a tailored plasmadensity structure. The carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the LW-IR pulse islocked to that of the drive laser to within a few percent. Such a versatiletunable IR source may meet the demands of many cutting-edge applications instrong-field physics and greatly promote their development.

Dark Matter Results from First 98.7-day Data of PandaX-II Experiment

  We report the WIMP dark matter search results using the first physics-rundata of the PandaX-II 500 kg liquid xenon dual-phase time-projection chamber,operating at the China JinPing Underground Laboratory. No dark matter candidateis identified above background. In combination with the data set during thecommissioning run, with a total exposure of 3.3$\times10^4$ kg-day,the moststringent limit to the spin-independent interaction between the ordinary andWIMP dark matter is set for a range of dark matter mass between 3.5 and 1000GeV/c$^2$. The best upper limit on the scattering cross section is found$2.5\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for the WIMP mass 40 GeV/c$^2$ at 90% confidencelevel.

Spin-Dependent Weakly-Interacting-Massive-Particle--Nucleon Cross  Section Limits from First Data of PandaX-II Experiment

  New constraints are presented on the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactionfrom the PandaX-II experiment, using a data set corresponding to a totalexposure of 3.3$\times10^4$ kg-days. Assuming a standard axial-vectorspin-dependent WIMP interaction with $^{129}$Xe and $^{131}$Xe nuclei, the moststringent upper limits on WIMP-neutron cross sections for WIMPs with massesabove 10 GeV/c$^{2}$ are set in all dark matter direct detection experiments.The minimum upper limit of $4.1\times 10^{-41}$ cm$^2$ at 90\% confidence levelis obtained for a WIMP mass of 40 GeV/c$^{2}$. This represents more than afactor of two improvement on the best available limits at this and highermasses. These improved cross-section limits provide more stringent constraintson the effective WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron couplings.

Limits on Axion Couplings from the first 80-day data of PandaX-II  Experiment

  We report new searches for the solar axions and galactic axion-like darkmatter particles, using the first low-background data from PandaX-II experimentat China Jinping Underground Laboratory, corresponding to a total exposure ofabout $2.7\times 10^4$ kg$\cdot$day. No solar axion or galactic axion-like darkmatter particle candidate has been identified. The upper limit on theaxion-electron coupling ($g_{Ae}$) from the solar flux is found to be about$4.35 \times 10^{-12}$ in mass range from $10^{-5}$ to 1 keV/$c^2$ with 90\%confidence level, similar to the recent LUX result. We also report a new bestlimit from the $^{57}$Fe de-excitation. On the other hand, the upper limit fromthe galactic axions is on the order of $10^{-13}$ in the mass range from 1keV/$c^2$ to 10 keV/$c^2$ with 90\% confidence level, slightly improvedcompared with the LUX.

Study of the material photon and electron background and the liquid  argon detector veto efficiency of the CDEX-10 experiment

  The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) is located at the China Jinpingunderground laboratory (CJPL) and aims to directly detect the WIMP flux withhigh sensitivity in the low mass region. Here we present a study of thepredicted photon and electron backgrounds including the background contributionof the structure materials of the germanium detector, the passive shieldingmaterials, and the intrinsic radioactivity of the liquid argon that serves asan anti-Compton active shielding detector. A detailed geometry is modeled andthe background contribution has been simulated based on the measuredradioactivities of all possible components within the GEANT4 program. Then thephoton and electron background level in the energy region of interest (<10^-2events kg-1 day-1 keV-1 (cpkkd)) is predicted based on Monte Carlo simulations.The simulated result is consistent with the design goal of CDEX-10 experiment,0.1 cpkkd, which shows that the active and passive shield design of CDEX-10 iseffective and feasible.

Introduction of the CDEX experiment

  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are the candidates of darkmatter in our universe. Up to now any direct interaction of WIMP with nucleihas not been observed yet. The exclusion limits of the spin-independent crosssection of WIMP-nucleon which have been experimentally obtained is about10^{-7}pb at high mass region and only 10^{-5}pb} at low mass region. ChinaJin-Ping underground laboratory CJPL is the deepest underground lab in theworld and provides a very promising environment for direct observation of darkmatter. The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) experiment is going to directlydetect the WIMP flux with high sensitivity in the low mass region. Both CJPLand CDEX have achieved a remarkable progress in recent two years. The CDEXemploys a point-contact germanium semi-conductor detector PCGe whose detectionthreshold is less than 300 eV. We report the measurement results of Muon flux,monitoring of radioactivity and Radon concentration carried out in CJPL, aswell describe the structure and performance of the 1 kg PCGe detector CDEX-1and 10kg detector array CDEX-10 including the detectors, electronics, shieldingand cooling systems. Finally we discuss the physics goals of the CDEX-1,CDEX-10 and the future CDEX-1T detectors.

Exploring genetic variation in the tomato (Solanum section Lycopersicon)  clade by whole-genome sequencing

  Genetic variation in the tomato clade was explored by sequencing a selectionof 84 tomato accessions and related wild species representative for theLycopersicon, Arcanum, Eriopersicon, and Neolycopersicon groups. We present areconstruction of three new reference genomes in support of our comparativegenome analyses. Sequence diversity in commercial breeding lines appearsextremely low, indicating the dramatic genetic erosion of crop tomatoes. Thisis reflected by the SNP count in wild species which can exceed 10 million i.e.20 fold higher than in crop accessions. Comparative sequence alignment revealsgroup, species, and accession specific polymorphisms, which explaincharacteristic fruit traits and growth habits in tomato accessions. Using genemodels from the annotated Heinz reference genome, we observe a bias in dN/dSratio in fruit and growth diversification genes compared to a random set ofgenes, which probably is the result of a positive selection. We detected highlydivergent segments in wild S. lycopersicum species, and footprints ofintrogressions in crop accessions originating from a common donor accession.Phylogenetic relationships of fruit diversification and growth specific genesfrom crop accessions show incomplete resolution and are dependent on theintrogression donor. In contrast, whole genome SNP information has sufficientpower to resolve the phylogenetic placement of each accession in the four maingroups in the Lycopersicon clade using Maximum Likelihood analyses.Phylogenetic relationships appear correlated with habitat and mating type andpoint to the occurrence of geographical races within these groups and thus areof practical importance for introgressive hybridization breeding. Our studyillustrates the need for multiple reference genomes in support of tomatocomparative genomics and Solanum genome evolution studies.

Precision Higgs Physics at CEPC

  The discovery of the Higgs boson with its mass around 125 GeV by the ATLASand CMS Collaborations marked the beginning of a new era in high energyphysics. The Higgs boson will be the subject of extensive studies of theongoing LHC program. At the same time, lepton collider based Higgs factorieshave been proposed as a possible next step beyond the LHC, with its main goalto precisely measure the properties of the Higgs boson and probe potential newphysics associated with the Higgs boson. The Circular Electron PositronCollider~(CEPC) is one of such proposed Higgs factories. The CEPC is an$e^+e^-$ circular collider proposed by and to be hosted in China. Located in atunnel of approximately 100~km in circumference, it will operate at acenter-of-mass energy of 240~GeV as the Higgs factory. In this paper, wepresent the first estimates on the precision of the Higgs boson propertymeasurements achievable at the CEPC and discuss implications of thesemeasurements.

The CDEX-1 1 kg Point-Contact Germanium Detector for Low Mass Dark  Matter Searches

  The CDEX Collaboration has been established for direct detection of lightdark matter particles, using ultra-low energy threshold p-type point-contactgermanium detectors, in China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL). The first1 kg point-contact germanium detector with a sub-keV energy threshold has beentested in a passive shielding system located in CJPL. The outputs from both thepoint-contact p+ electrode and the outside n+ electrode make it possible toscan the lower energy range of less than 1 keV and at the same time to detectthe higher energy range up to 3 MeV. The outputs from both p+ and n+ electrodemay also provide a more powerful method for signal discrimination for darkmatter experiment. Some key parameters, including energy resolution, dead time,decay times of internal X-rays, and system stability, have been tested andmeasured. The results show that the 1 kg point-contact germanium detector,together with its shielding system and electronics, can run smoothly with goodperformances. This detector system will be deployed for dark matter searchexperiments.

Assemblathon 2: evaluating de novo methods of genome assembly in three  vertebrate species

  Background - The process of generating raw genome sequence data continues tobecome cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data intohigh-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genomeassembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of theirperformance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newerread technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembledsequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess thequality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions areintended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly. Results- In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled forthree vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a totalof 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated theseassemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, andseveral statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten keymeasures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies. Conclusions- Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing asignificant representation of their genes, regulatory sequences, and overallgenome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entriessuggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genomeassembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of onespecies may not necessarily work well for another.

Identifying the Best Machine Learning Algorithms for Brain Tumor  Segmentation, Progression Assessment, and Overall Survival Prediction in the  BRATS Challenge

  Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with differentdegrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneoushistologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necroticcore, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is alsoportrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted byvarying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magneticresonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties.Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors thatmake these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amountof resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, whenevaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression.Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of thevarious tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysistowards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses thestate-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor imageanalysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the InternationalBrain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, wefocus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions inpre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtueof longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANOcriteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRIscans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigatethe challenge of identifying the best ML algorithms for each of these tasks,considering that apart from being diverse on each instance of the challenge,the multi-institutional mpMRI BraTS dataset has also been a continuouslyevolving/growing dataset.

Measurement of the absolute branching fraction of $D^{+}\rightarrow\bar  K^0 e^{+}ν_{e}$ via $\bar K^0\toπ^0π^0$

  By analyzing 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ data collected at the center-of-mass energy$\sqrt s=3.773$ GeV with the BESIII detector, we measure the absolute branchingfraction of the semileptonic decay $D^+\rightarrow\bar K^0 e^{+}\nu_{e}$ to be${\mathcal B}(D^{+}\rightarrow\bar K^0 e^{+}\nu_{e})=(8.59 \pm 0.14 \pm0.21)\%$ using $\bar K^0\to K^0_S\to \pi^0\pi^0$, where the first uncertaintyis statistical and the second systematic. Our result is consistent withprevious measurements within uncertainties.

Measurement of Singly Cabibbo Suppressed Decays $Λ_c^{+}\to  pπ^{+}π^{-}$ and $Λ_c^{+}\to pK^{+}K^{-}$

  Using 567 $pb^{-1}$ of data collected with the BESIII detector at acenter-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=$ 4.599 $GeV$, near the$\Lambda_{c}^{+}\Lambda_{c}^{-}$ threshold, we study the singlyCabibbo-suppressed decays $\Lambda_c^{+}\to p\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and$\Lambda_c^{+}\to pK^{+}K^{-}$. By normalizing with respect to theCabibbo-favored decay $\Lambda_c^{+}\to pK^{-}\pi^{+}$, we obtain ratios ofbranching fractions: $\frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^{+}\top\pi^{+}\pi^{-})}{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^{+}\to pK^{-}\pi^{+})}$ = $(6.70 \pm0.48 \pm 0.25)\%$, $\frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^{+}\top\phi)}{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^{+}\to pK^{-}\pi^{+})}$ = $(1.81 \pm 0.33 \pm0.13)\%$, and $\frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^{+}\topK^{+}K^{-}_{\text{non-}\phi})}{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^{+}\to pK^{-}\pi^{+})}$ =$(9.36 \pm 2.22 \pm 0.71)\times10^{-3}$, where the uncertainties arestatistical and systematic, respectively. The absolute branching fractions arealso presented. Among these measurements, the decay $\Lambda_c^{+}\top\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ is observed for the first time, and the precision of thebranching fraction for $\Lambda_c^{+}\to pK^{+}K^{-}_{\text{non-}\phi}$ and$\Lambda_c^{+}\to p\phi$ is significantly improved.

Measurements of the branching fractions for $D^+\to K^0_SK^0_SK^+$,  $K^0_SK^0_Sπ^+$ and $D^0\to K^0_SK^0_S$, $K^0_SK^0_SK^0_S$

  By analyzing $2.93\ \rm fb^{-1}$ of data taken at the $\psi(3770)$ resonancepeak with the BESIII detector, we measure the branching fractions for thehadronic decays $D^+\to K^0_SK^0_S K^+$, $D^+\to K^0_SK^0_S \pi^+$, $D^0\toK^0_S K^0_S$ and $D^0\to K^0_SK^0_SK^0_S$. They are determined to be ${\mathcalB}(D^+\to K^0_SK^0_SK^+)=(2.54 \pm 0.05_{\rm stat.} \pm 0.12_{\rm sys.})\times10^{-3}$, ${\mathcal B}(D^+\to K^0_SK^0_S\pi^+)=(2.70 \pm 0.05_{\rm stat.} \pm0.12_{\rm sys.})\times 10^{-3}$, ${\mathcal B}(D^0\to K^0_SK^0_S)=(1.67 \pm0.11_{\rm stat.} \pm 0.11_{\rm sys.})\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\mathcal B}(D^0\toK^0_SK^0_SK^0_S)=(7.21 \pm 0.33_{\rm stat.} \pm 0.44_{\rm sys.})\times10^{-4}$, where the second one is measured for the first time and the othersare measured with significantly improved precision over the previousmeasurements.

Measurement of the Branching Fraction For the Semi-Leptonic Decays  $D^{0(+)}\to π^{-(0)}μ^+ν_μ$ and Test of Lepton Flavor Universality

  Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $2.93\,\rmfb^{-1}$ taken at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773\,GeV with the BESIIIdetector operated at the BEPCII collider, we perform an analysis of thesemi-leptonic decays $D^{0(+)}\to \pi^{-(0)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$. The branchingfractions of $D^0\to \pi^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+\to \pi^0\mu^+\nu_\mu$ aremeasured to be $(0.272 \pm 0.008_{\rm stat.} \pm 0.006_{\rm syst.})\%$ and$(0.350 \pm 0.011_{\rm stat.} \pm 0.010_{\rm syst.})\%$, respectively, wherethe former is of much improved precision compared to previous results and thelatter is determined for the first time. Using these results along withprevious BESIII measurements of $D^{0(+)}\to \pi^{-(0)}e^+\nu_e$, we calculatethe branching fraction ratios to be ${\mathcal R}^0\equiv {\mathcalB}_{D^{0}\to \pi^{-}\mu^+\nu_\mu}/{\mathcal B}_{D^{0}\to\pi^{-}e^+\nu_e}=0.922\pm 0.030_{\rm stat.}\pm0.022_{\rm syst.}$ and ${\mathcalR}^+\equiv {\mathcal B}_{D^{+}\to \pi^{0}\mu^+\nu_\mu}/{\mathcal B}_{D^{+}\to\pi^{0}e^+\nu_e}=0.964\pm 0.037_{\rm stat.}\pm0.026_{\rm syst.}$, which arecompatible with the theoretical expectation of lepton flavor universalitywithin $1.7\sigma$ and $0.5\sigma$, respectively. We also examine the branchingfraction ratios in different four-momentum transfer square regions, and find nosignificant deviations from the standard model predictions.

Measurement of Singly Cabibbo-Suppressed Decays  $D^{0}\toπ^{0}π^{0}π^{0}$, $π^{0}π^{0}η$, $π^{0}ηη$ and  $ηηη$

  Using a data sample of $e^+e^-$ collision data corresponding to an integratedluminosity of 2.93 $fb^{-1}$ collected with the BESIII detector at acenter-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}= 3.773~GeV$,we search for the singlyCabibbo-suppressed decays $D^{0}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}$,$\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\eta$, $\pi^{0}\eta\eta$ and $\eta\eta\eta$ using the double tagmethod. The absolute branching fractions are measured to be$\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}) = (2.0 \pm 0.4 \pm 0.3)\times10^{-4}$, $\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\eta) = (3.8 \pm 1.1 \pm0.7)\times 10^{-4}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\to\pi^{0}\eta\eta) = (7.3 \pm 1.6\pm 1.5)\times 10^{-4}$ with the statistical significances of $4.8\sigma$,$3.8\sigma$ and $5.5\sigma$, respectively, where the first uncertainties arestatistical and the second ones systematic. No significant signal of$D^{0}\to\eta\eta\eta$ is found, and the upper limit on its decay branchingfraction is set to be $\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\to\eta\eta\eta) < 1.3 \times 10^{-4}$at the $90\%$ confidence level.
