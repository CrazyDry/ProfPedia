Ask, and shall you receive?: Understanding Desire Fulfillment in Natural  Language Text

  The ability to comprehend wishes or desires and their fulfillment isimportant to Natural Language Understanding. This paper introduces the task ofidentifying if a desire expressed by a subject in a given short piece of textwas fulfilled. We propose various unstructured and structured models thatcapture fulfillment cues such as the subject's emotional state and actions. Ourexperiments with two different datasets demonstrate the importance ofunderstanding the narrative and discourse structure to address this task.

Modeling Dynamic Relationships Between Characters in Literary Novels

  Studying characters plays a vital role in computationally representing andinterpreting narratives. Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferringcharacter roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships.Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesizethat relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of thenarrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structuredprediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised framework to learnrelationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We presenta Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about therelationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic andsemantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigatethe textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such aframework outperforms competitive baselines.

Inferring Interpersonal Relations in Narrative Summaries

  Characterizing relationships between people is fundamental for theunderstanding of narratives. In this work, we address the problem of inferringthe polarity of relationships between people in narrative summaries. Weformulate the problem as a joint structured prediction for each narrative, andpresent a model that combines evidence from linguistic and semantic features,as well as features based on the structure of the social community in the text.We also provide a clustering-based approach that can exploit regularities innarrative types. e.g., learn an affinity for love-triangles in romanticstories. On a dataset of movie summaries from Wikipedia, our structured modelsprovide more than a 30% error-reduction over a competitive baseline thatconsiders pairs of characters in isolation.

Discovering Archetypes to Interpret Evolution of Individual Behavior

  In this paper, we aim to discover archetypical patterns of individualevolution in large social networks. In our work, an archetype comprises of$\textit{progressive stages}$ of distinct behavior. We introduce a novelGaussian Hidden Markov Model (G-HMM) Cluster to identify archetypes ofevolutionary patterns. G-HMMs allow for: near limitless behavioral variation;imposing constraints on how individuals can evolve; different evolutionaryrates; and are parsimonious. Our experiments with Academic and StackExchangedataset discover insightful archetypes. We identify four archetypes forresearchers: $\textit{Steady}$, $\textit{Diverse, Evolving and Diffuse}$. Weobserve clear differences in the evolution of male and female researcherswithin the same archetype. Specifically, women and men differ within anarchetype (e.g. Diverse) in how they start, how they transition and the timespent in mid-career. We also found that the differences in grant income arebetter explained by the differences in archetype than by differences in gender.For StackOverflow, discovered archetypes could be labeled as $\textit{Experts,Seekers, Enthusiasts, and Facilitators}$. We have strong quantitative resultswith competing baselines for activity prediction and perplexity. For futuresession prediction, the proposed G-HMM cluster model improves by an average of$32\%$ for different Stack Exchanges and $24\%$ for Academic dataset. Our modelalso exhibits lower perplexity than the baselines.
