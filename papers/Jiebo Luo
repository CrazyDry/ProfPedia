Pinterest Board Recommendation for Twitter Users

  Pinboard on Pinterest is an emerging media to engage online social mediausers, on which users post online images for specific topics. Regardless of itssignificance, there is little previous work specifically to facilitateinformation discovery based on pinboards. This paper proposes a novel pinboardrecommendation system for Twitter users. In order to associate contents fromthe two social media platforms, we propose to use MultiLabel classification tomap Twitter user followees to pinboard topics and visual diversification torecommend pinboards given user interested topics. A preliminary experiment on adataset with 2000 users validated our proposed system.

Catching Fire via "Likes": Inferring Topic Preferences of Trump  Followers on Twitter

  In this paper, we propose a framework to infer the topic preferences ofDonald Trump's followers on Twitter. We first use latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) to derive the weighted mixture of topics for each Trump tweet. Then weuse negative binomial regression to model the "likes," with the weights of eachtopic serving as explanatory variables. Our study shows that attackingDemocrats such as President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clintonearns Trump the most "likes." Our framework of inference is generalizable tothe study of other politicians.

To Follow or Not to Follow: Analyzing the Growth Patterns of the  Trumpists on Twitter

  In this paper, we analyze the growth patterns of Donald Trump's followers(Trumpists, henceforth) on Twitter. We first construct a random walk model witha time trend to study the growth trend and the effects of public debates. Wethen analyze the relationship between Trump's activity on Twitter and thegrowth of his followers. Thirdly, we analyze the effects of such controversialevents as calling for Muslim ban and his 'schlonged' remark.

Election Bias: Comparing Polls and Twitter in the 2016 U.S. Election

  While the polls have been the most trusted source for election predictionsfor decades, in the recent presidential election they were called inaccurateand biased. How inaccurate were the polls in this election and can social mediabeat the polls as an accurate election predictor? Polls from several newsoutlets and sentiment analysis on Twitter data were used, in conjunction withthe results of the election, to answer this question and outline furtherresearch on the best method for predicting the outcome of future elections.

When Follow is Just One Click Away: Understanding Twitter Follow  Behavior in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election

  Motivated by the two paradoxical facts that the marginal cost of followingone extra candidate is close to zero and that the majority of Twitter userschoose to follow only one or two candidates, we study the Twitter followbehaviors observed in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Specifically, wecomplete the following tasks: (1) analyze Twitter follow patterns of thepresidential election on Twitter, (2) use negative binomial regression to studythe effects of gender and occupation on the number of candidates that onefollows, and (3) use multinomial logistic regression to investigate the effectsof gender, occupation and celebrities on the choice of candidates to follow.

Understanding Illicit Drug Use Behaviors by Mining Social Media

  Drug use by people is on the rise and is of great interest to public healthagencies and law enforcement agencies. As found by the National Survey on DrugUse and Health, 20 million Americans aged 12 years or older consumed illicitdrugs in the past few 30 days. Given their ubiquity in everyday life, drugabuse related studies have received much and constant attention. However, mostof the existing studies rely on surveys. Surveys present a fair number ofproblems because of their nature. Surveys on sensitive topics such as illicitdrug use may not be answered truthfully by the people taking them. Selecting arepresentative sample to survey is another major challenge. In this paper, weexplore the possibility of using big data from social media in order tounderstand illicit drug use behaviors. Instagram posts are collected using drugrelated terms by analyzing the hashtags supplied with each post. A large anddynamic dictionary of frequent illicit drug related slang is used to find theseposts. These posts are studied to find common drug consumption behaviors withregard to time of day and week. Furthermore, by studying the accounts followedby the users of drug related posts, we hope to discover common interests sharedby drug users.

Learning to Generate Time-Lapse Videos Using Multi-Stage Dynamic  Generative Adversarial Networks

  Taking a photo outside, can we predict the immediate future, e.g., how wouldthe cloud move in the sky? We address this problem by presenting a generativeadversarial network (GAN) based two-stage approach to generating realistictime-lapse videos of high resolution. Given the first frame, our model learnsto generate long-term future frames. The first stage generates videos ofrealistic contents for each frame. The second stage refines the generated videofrom the first stage by enforcing it to be closer to real videos with regard tomotion dynamics. To further encourage vivid motion in the final generatedvideo, Gram matrix is employed to model the motion more precisely. We build alarge scale time-lapse dataset, and test our approach on this new dataset.Using our model, we are able to generate realistic videos of up to $128\times128$ resolution for 32 frames. Quantitative and qualitative experiment resultshave demonstrated the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-artmodels.

The Effect of Pets on Happiness: A Large-scale Multi-Factor Analysis  using Social Multimedia

  From reducing stress and loneliness, to boosting productivity and overallwell-being, pets are believed to play a significant role in people's dailylives. Many traditional studies have identified that frequent interactions withpets could make individuals become healthier and more optimistic, andultimately enjoy a happier life. However, most of those studies are not onlyrestricted in scale, but also may carry biases by using subjectiveself-reports, interviews, and questionnaires as the major approaches. In thispaper, we leverage large-scale data collected from social media and thestate-of-the-art deep learning technologies to study this phenomenon in depthand breadth. Our study includes four major steps: 1) collecting timeline postsfrom around 20,000 Instagram users, 2) using face detection and recognition on2-million photos to infer users' demographics, relationship status, and whetherhaving children, 3) analyzing a user's degree of happiness based on images andcaptions via smiling classification and textual sentiment analysis, 3) applyingtransfer learning techniques to retrain the final layer of the Inception v3model for pet classification, and 4) analyzing the effects of pets on happinessin terms of multiple factors of user demographics. Our main results havedemonstrated the efficacy of our proposed method with many new insights. Webelieve this method is also applicable to other domains as a scalable,efficient, and effective methodology for modeling and analyzing socialbehaviors and psychological well-being. In addition, to facilitate the researchinvolving human faces, we also release our dataset of 700K analyzed faces.

Using User Generated Online Photos to Estimate and Monitor Air Pollution  in Major Cities

  With the rapid development of economy in China over the past decade, airpollution has become an increasingly serious problem in major cities and causedgrave public health concerns in China. Recently, a number of studies have dealtwith air quality and air pollution. Among them, some attempt to predict andmonitor the air quality from different sources of information, ranging fromdeployed physical sensors to social media. These methods are either tooexpensive or unreliable, prompting us to search for a novel and effective wayto sense the air quality. In this study, we propose to employ the state of theart in computer vision techniques to analyze photos that can be easily acquiredfrom online social media. Next, we establish the correlation between the hazelevel computed directly from photos with the official PM 2.5 record of thetaken city at the taken time. Our experiments based on both synthetic and realphotos have shown the promise of this image-based approach to estimating andmonitoring air pollution.

User-Curated Image Collections: Modeling and Recommendation

  Most state-of-the-art image retrieval and recommendation systemspredominantly focus on individual images. In contrast, socially curated imagecollections, condensing distinctive yet coherent images into one set, arelargely overlooked by the research communities. In this paper, we aim to designa novel recommendation system that can provide users with image collectionsrelevant to individual personal preferences and interests. To this end, two keyissues need to be addressed, i.e., image collection modeling and similaritymeasurement. For image collection modeling, we consider each image collectionas a whole in a group sparse reconstruction framework and extract concisecollection descriptors given the pretrained dictionaries. We then considerimage collection recommendation as a dynamic similarity measurement problem inresponse to user's clicked image set, and employ a metric learner to measurethe similarity between the image collection and the clicked image set. As thereis no previous work directly comparable to this study, we implement severalcompetitive baselines and related methods for comparison. The evaluations on alarge scale Pinterest data set have validated the effectiveness of our proposedmethods for modeling and recommending image collections.

Deciphering the 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign in the Twitter Sphere: A  Comparison of the Trumpists and Clintonists

  In this paper, we study follower demographics of Donald Trump and HillaryClinton, the two leading candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Webuild a unique dataset US2016, which includes the number of followers for eachcandidate from September 17, 2015 to December 22, 2015. US2016 also includesthe geographical location of these followers, the number of their own followersand, very importantly, the profile image of each follower. We use individuals'number of followers and profile images to analyze four dimensions of followerdemographics: social status, gender, race and age. Our study shows that interms of social influence, the Trumpists are more polarized than theClintonists: they tend to have either a lot of influence or little influence.We also find that compared with the Clintonists, the Trumpists are more likelyto be either very young or very old. Our study finds no gender affinity effectfor Clinton in the Twitter sphere, but we do find that the Clintonists are moreracially diverse.

Image Captioning with Semantic Attention

  Automatically generating a natural language description of an image hasattracted interests recently both because of its importance in practicalapplications and because it connects two major artificial intelligence fields:computer vision and natural language processing. Existing approaches are eithertop-down, which start from a gist of an image and convert it into words, orbottom-up, which come up with words describing various aspects of an image andthen combine them. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that combines bothapproaches through a model of semantic attention. Our algorithm learns toselectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hiddenstates and outputs of recurrent neural networks. The selection and fusion forma feedback connecting the top-down and bottom-up computation. We evaluate ouralgorithm on two public benchmarks: Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K. Experimentalresults show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-artapproaches consistently across different evaluation metrics.

Tracking Illicit Drug Dealing and Abuse on Instagram using Multimodal  Analysis

  Illicit drug trade via social media sites, especially photo-orientedInstagram, has become a severe problem in recent years. As a result, trackingdrug dealing and abuse on Instagram is of interest to law enforcement agenciesand public health agencies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach todetecting drug abuse and dealing automatically by utilizing multimodal data onsocial media. This approach also enables us to identify drug-related posts andanalyze the behavior patterns of drug-related user accounts. To better utilizemultimodal data on social media, multimodal analysis methods includingmultitask learning and decision-level fusion are employed in our framework.Experiment results on expertly labeled data have demonstrated the effectivenessof our approach, as well as its scalability and reproducibility overlabor-intensive conventional approaches.

When Do Luxury Cars Hit the Road? Findings by A Big Data Approach

  In this paper, we focus on studying the appearing time of different kinds ofcars on the road. This information will enable us to infer the life style ofthe car owners. The results can further be used to guide marketing towards carowners. Conventionally, this kind of study is carried out by sending outquestionnaires, which is limited in scale and diversity. To solve this problem,we propose a fully automatic method to carry out this study. Our study is basedon publicly available surveillance camera data. To make the results reliable,we only use the high resolution cameras (i.e. resolution greater than $1280\times 720$). Images from the public cameras are downloaded every minute. Afterobtaining 50,000 images, we apply faster R-CNN (region-based convoluntionalneural network) to detect the cars in the downloaded images and a fine-tunedVGG16 model is used to recognize the car makes. Based on the recognitionresults, we present a data-driven analysis on the relationship between carmakes and their appearing times, with implications on lifestyles.

Pricing the Woman Card: Gender Politics between Hillary Clinton and  Donald Trump

  In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to measure the impact of the'woman card' exchange between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Building from aunique dataset of the two candidates' Twitter followers, we first examine thetransition dynamics of the two candidates' Twitter followers one week beforethe exchange and one week after. Then we train a convolutional neural networkto classify the gender of the followers and unfollowers, and study how women inparticular are reacting to the 'woman card' exchange. Our study suggests thatthe 'woman card' comment has made women more likely to follow Hillary Clinton,less likely to unfollow her and that it has apparently not affected the gendercomposition of Trump followers.

Will Sanders Supporters Jump Ship for Trump? Fine-grained Analysis of  Twitter Followers

  In this paper, we study the likelihood of Bernie Sanders supporters votingfor Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton. Building from a unique time-seriesdataset of the three candidates' Twitter followers, which we make public here,we first study the proportion of Sanders followers who simultaneously followTrump (but not Clinton) and how this evolves over time. Then we train aconvolutional neural network to classify the gender of Sanders followers, andstudy whether men are more likely to jump ship for Trump than women. Our studyshows that between March and May an increasing proportion of Sanders followersare following Trump (but not Clinton). The proportion of Sanders followers whofollow Clinton but not Trump has actually decreased. Equally important, ourstudy suggests that the jumping ship behavior will be affected by gender andthat men are more likely to switch to Trump than women.

Using Social Media to Promote STEM Education: Matching College Students  with Role Models

  STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields have becomeincreasingly central to U.S. economic competitiveness and growth. The shortagein the STEM workforce has brought promoting STEM education upfront. The rapidgrowth of social media usage provides a unique opportunity to predict users'real-life identities and interests from online texts and photos. In this paper,we propose an innovative approach by leveraging social media to promote STEMeducation: matching Twitter college student users with diverse LinkedIn STEMprofessionals using a ranking algorithm based on the similarities of theirdemographics and interests. We share the belief that increasing STEM presencein the form of introducing career role models who share similar interests anddemographics will inspire students to develop interests in STEM related fieldsand emulate their models. Our evaluation on 2,000 real college studentsdemonstrated the accuracy of our ranking algorithm. We also design a novelimplementation that recommends matched role models to the students.

Mining Fashion Outfit Composition Using An End-to-End Deep Learning  Approach on Set Data

  Composing fashion outfits involves deep understanding of fashion standardswhile incorporating creativity for choosing multiple fashion items (e.g.,Jewelry, Bag, Pants, Dress). In fashion websites, popular or high-qualityfashion outfits are usually designed by fashion experts and followed by largeaudiences. In this paper, we propose a machine learning system to composefashion outfits automatically. The core of the proposed automatic compositionsystem is to score fashion outfit candidates based on the appearances andmeta-data. We propose to leverage outfit popularity on fashion orientedwebsites to supervise the scoring component. The scoring component is amulti-modal multi-instance deep learning system that evaluates instanceaesthetics and set compatibility simultaneously. In order to train and evaluatethe proposed composition system, we have collected a large scale fashion outfitdataset with 195K outfits and 368K fashion items from Polyvore. Although thefashion outfit scoring and composition is rather challenging, we have achievedan AUC of 85% for the scoring component, and an accuracy of 77% for aconstrained composition task.

Do They All Look the Same? Deciphering Chinese, Japanese and Koreans by  Fine-Grained Deep Learning

  We study to what extend Chinese, Japanese and Korean faces can be classifiedand which facial attributes offer the most important cues. First, we propose anovel way of obtaining large numbers of facial images with nationality labels.Then we train state-of-the-art neural networks with these labeled images. Weare able to achieve an accuracy of 75.03% in the classification task, withchances being 33.33% and human accuracy 38.89% . Further, we train multiplefacial attribute classifiers to identify the most distinctive features for eachgroup. We find that Chinese, Japanese and Koreans do exhibit substantialdifferences in certain attributes, such as bangs, smiling, and bushy eyebrows.Along the way, we uncover several gender-related cross-country patterns aswell. Our work, which complements existing APIs such as Microsoft CognitiveServices and Face++, could find potential applications in tourism, e-commerce,social media marketing, criminal justice and even counter-terrorism.

Gender Politics in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election: A Computer  Vision Approach

  Gender is playing an important role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,especially with Hillary Clinton becoming the first female presidential nomineeand Donald Trump being frequently accused of sexism. In this paper, weintroduce computer vision to the study of gender politics and present animage-driven method that can measure the effects of gender in an accurate andtimely manner. We first collect all the profile images of the candidates'Twitter followers. Then we train a convolutional neural network using imagesthat contain gender labels. Lastly, we classify all the follower and unfollowerimages. Through two case studies, one on the `woman card' controversy and oneon Sanders followers, we demonstrate how gender is informing the 2016presidential election. Our framework of analysis can be readily generalized toother case studies and elections.

Tactics and Tallies: Inferring Voter Preferences in the 2016 U.S.  Presidential Primaries Using Sparse Learning

  In this paper, we propose a web-centered framework to infer voter preferencesfor the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries. Using Twitter data collected fromSept. 2015 to March 2016, we first uncover the tweeting tactics of thecandidates and then exploit the variations in the number of 'likes' to infervoters' preference. With sparse learning, we are able to reveal neutral topicsas well as positive and negative ones.  Methodologically, we are able to achieve a higher predictive power withsparse learning. Substantively, we show that for Hillary Clinton the (only)positive issue area is women's rights. We demonstrate that Hillary Clinton'stactic of linking herself to President Obama resonates well with her supportersbut the same is not true for Bernie Sanders. In addition, we show that DonaldTrump is a major topic for all the other candidates, and that the women'srights issue is equally emphasized in Sanders' campaign as in Clinton's.

When Fashion Meets Big Data: Discriminative Mining of Best Selling  Clothing Features

  With the prevalence of e-commence websites and the ease of online shopping,consumers are embracing huge amounts of various options in products.Undeniably, shopping is one of the most essential activities in our society andstudying consumer's shopping behavior is important for the industry as well associology and psychology. Indisputable, one of the most popular e-commercecategories is clothing business. There arises the needs for analysis of popularand attractive clothing features which could further boost many emergingapplications, such as clothing recommendation and advertising. In this work, wedesign a novel system that consists of three major components: 1) exploring andorganizing a large-scale clothing dataset from a online shopping website, 2)pruning and extracting images of best-selling products in clothing item dataand user transaction history, and 3) utilizing a machine learning basedapproach to discovering fine-grained clothing attributes as the representativeand discriminative characteristics of popular clothing style elements. Throughthe experiments over a large-scale online clothing shopping dataset, wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system, and obtain usefulinsights on clothing consumption trends and profitable clothing features.

When Saliency Meets Sentiment: Understanding How Image Content Invokes  Emotion and Sentiment

  Sentiment analysis is crucial for extracting social signals from social mediacontent. Due to the prevalence of images in social media, image sentimentanalysis is receiving increasing attention in recent years. However, mostexisting systems are black-boxes that do not provide insight on how imagecontent invokes sentiment and emotion in the viewers. Psychological studieshave confirmed that salient objects in an image often invoke emotions. In thiswork, we investigate more fine-grained and more comprehensive interactionbetween visual saliency and visual sentiment. In particular, we partitionimages in several primary scene-type dimensions, including: open-closed,natural-manmade, indoor-outdoor, and face-noface. Using state of the artsaliency detection algorithm and sentiment classification algorithm, we examinehow the sentiment of the salient region(s) in an image relates to the overallsentiment of the image. The experiments on a representative image emotiondataset have shown interesting correlation between saliency and sentiment indifferent scene types and in turn shed light on the mechanism of visualsentiment evocation.

Solving Cold-Start Problem in Large-scale Recommendation Engines: A Deep  Learning Approach

  Collaborative Filtering (CF) is widely used in large-scale recommendationengines because of its efficiency, accuracy and scalability. However, inpractice, the fact that recommendation engines based on CF require interactionsbetween users and items before making recommendations, make it inappropriatefor new items which haven't been exposed to the end users to interact with.This is known as the cold-start problem. In this paper we introduce a novelapproach which employs deep learning to tackle this problem in any CF basedrecommendation engine. One of the most important features of the proposedtechnique is the fact that it can be applied on top of any existing CF basedrecommendation engine without changing the CF core. We successfully appliedthis technique to overcome the item cold-start problem in Careerbuilder's CFbased recommendation engine. Our experiments show that the proposed techniqueis very efficient to resolve the cold-start problem while maintaining highaccuracy of the CF recommendations.

Image Based Appraisal of Real Estate Properties

  Real estate appraisal, which is the process of estimating the price for realestate properties, is crucial for both buys and sellers as the basis fornegotiation and transaction. Traditionally, the repeat sales model has beenwidely adopted to estimate real estate price. However, it depends the designand calculation of a complex economic related index, which is challenging toestimate accurately. Today, real estate brokers provide easy access to detailedonline information on real estate properties to their clients. We areinterested in estimating the real estate price from these large amounts ofeasily accessed data. In particular, we analyze the prediction power of onlinehouse pictures, which is one of the key factors for online users to make apotential visiting decision. The development of robust computer visionalgorithms makes the analysis of visual content possible. In this work, weemploy a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict real estate price using thestate-of-the-art visual features. The experimental results indicate that ourmodel outperforms several of other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms interms of both mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error(MAPE).

What the Language You Tweet Says About Your Occupation

  Many aspects of people's lives are proven to be deeply connected to theirjobs. In this paper, we first investigate the distinct characteristics of majoroccupation categories based on tweets. From multiple social media platforms, wegather several types of user information. From users' LinkedIn webpages, welearn their proficiencies. To overcome the ambiguity of self-reportedinformation, a soft clustering approach is applied to extract occupations fromcrowd-sourced data. Eight job categories are extracted, including Marketing,Administrator, Start-up, Editor, Software Engineer, Public Relation, OfficeClerk, and Designer. Meanwhile, users' posts on Twitter provide cues forunderstanding their linguistic styles, interests, and personalities. Ourresults suggest that people of different jobs have unique tendencies in certainlanguage styles and interests. Our results also clearly reveal distinctivelevels in terms of Big Five Traits for different jobs. Finally, a classifier isbuilt to predict job types based on the features extracted from tweets. A highaccuracy indicates a strong discrimination power of language features for jobprediction task.

Tales of Two Cities: Using Social Media to Understand Idiosyncratic  Lifestyles in Distinctive Metropolitan Areas

  Lifestyles are a valuable model for understanding individuals' physical andmental lives, comparing social groups, and making recommendations for improvingpeople's lives. In this paper, we examine and compare lifestyle behaviors ofpeople living in cities of different sizes, utilizing freely available socialmedia data as a large-scale, low-cost alternative to traditional surveymethods. We use the Greater New York City area as a representative for largecities, and the Greater Rochester area as a representative for smaller citiesin the United States. We employed matrix factor analysis as an unsupervisedmethod to extract salient mobility and work-rest patterns for a largepopulation of users within each metropolitan area. We discovered interestinghuman behavior patterns at both a larger scale and a finer granularity than ispresent in previous literature, some of which allow us to quantitativelycompare the behaviors of individuals of living in big cities to those living insmall cities. We believe that our social media-based approach to lifestyleanalysis represents a powerful tool for social computing in the big data age.

Detection and Analysis of 2016 US Presidential Election Related Rumors  on Twitter

  The 2016 U.S. presidential election has witnessed the major role of Twitterin the year's most important political event. Candidates used this social mediaplatform extensively for online campaigns. Meanwhile, social media has beenfilled with rumors, which might have had huge impacts on voters' decisions. Inthis paper, we present a thorough analysis of rumor tweets from the followersof two presidential candidates: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. To overcomethe difficulty of labeling a large amount of tweets as training data, we detectrumor tweets by matching them with verified rumor articles. We analyze over 8million tweets collected from the followers of the two candidates. Our resultsprovide answers to several primary concerns about rumors in this election,including: which side of the followers posted the most rumors, who posted theserumors, what rumors they posted, and when they posted these rumors. Theinsights of this paper can help us understand the online rumor behaviors inAmerican politics.

Learning from Noisy Labels with Distillation

  The ability of learning from noisy labels is very useful in many visualrecognition tasks, as a vast amount of data with noisy labels are relativelyeasy to obtain. Traditionally, the label noises have been treated asstatistical outliers, and approaches such as importance re-weighting andbootstrap have been proposed to alleviate the problem. According to ourobservation, the real-world noisy labels exhibit multi-mode characteristics asthe true labels, rather than behaving like independent random outliers. In thiswork, we propose a unified distillation framework to use side information,including a small clean dataset and label relations in knowledge graph, to"hedge the risk" of learning from noisy labels. Furthermore, unlike thetraditional approaches evaluated based on simulated label noises, we propose asuite of new benchmark datasets, in Sports, Species and Artifacts domains, toevaluate the task of learning from noisy labels in the practical setting. Theempirical study demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method in allthe domains.

A World of Difference: Divergent Word Interpretations among People

  Divergent word usages reflect differences among people. In this paper, wepresent a novel angle for studying word usage divergence -- wordinterpretations. We propose an approach that quantifies semantic differences ininterpretations among different groups of people. The effectiveness of ourapproach is validated by quantitative evaluations. Experiment results indicatethat divergences in word interpretations exist. We further apply the approachto two well studied types of differences between people -- gender and region.The detected words with divergent interpretations reveal the unique features ofspecific groups of people. For gender, we discover that certain differentinterests, social attitudes, and characters between males and females arereflected in their divergent interpretations of many words. For region, we findthat specific interpretations of certain words reveal the geographical andcultural features of different regions.

Spice up Your Chat: The Intentions and Sentiment Effects of Using Emoji

  Emojis, as a new way of conveying nonverbal cues, are widely adopted incomputer-mediated communications. In this paper, first from a message senderperspective, we focus on people's motives in using four types of emojis --positive, neutral, negative, and non-facial. We compare the willingness levelsof using these emoji types for seven typical intentions that people usuallyapply nonverbal cues for in communication. The results of extensive statisticalhypothesis tests not only report the popularities of the intentions, but alsouncover the subtle differences between emoji types in terms of intended uses.Second, from a perspective of message recipients, we further study thesentiment effects of emojis, as well as their duplications, on verbal messages.Different from previous studies in emoji sentiment, we study the sentiments ofemojis and their contexts as a whole. The experiment results indicate that thepowers of conveying sentiment are different between four emoji types, and thesentiment effects of emojis vary in the contexts of different valences.

Detecting the Hate Code on Social Media

  Social media has become an indispensable part of the everyday lives ofmillions of people around the world. It provides a platform for expressingopinions and beliefs, communicated to a massive audience. However, this easewith which people can express themselves has also allowed for the large scalespread of propaganda and hate speech. To prevent violating the abuse policiesof social media platforms and also to avoid detection by automatic systems likeGoogle's Conversation AI, racists have begun to use a code (a movement termedOperation Google). This involves substituting references to communities bybenign words that seem out of context, in hate filled posts or Tweets. Forexample, users have used the words Googles and Bings to represent theAfrican-American and Asian communities, respectively. By generating the list ofusers who post such content, we move a step forward from classifying tweets byallowing us to study the usage pattern of these concentrated set of users.

Tactics and Tallies: A Study of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign  Using Twitter 'Likes'

  We propose a framework to measure, evaluate, and rank campaign effectivenessin the ongoing 2016 U.S. presidential election. Using Twitter data collectedfrom Sept. 2015 to Jan. 2016, we first uncover the tweeting tactics of thecandidates and second, using negative binomial regression and exploiting thevariations in 'likes,' we evaluate the effectiveness of these tactics. Thirdly,we rank the candidates' campaign tactics by calculating the conditionalexpectation of their generated 'likes.'  We show that while Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio put much weight on PresidentObama, this tactic is not being well received by their supporters. Wedemonstrate that Hillary Clinton's tactic of linking herself to President Obamaresonates well with her supporters but the same is not true for Bernie Sanders.In addition, we show that Donald Trump is a major topic for all the othercandidates and that the women issue is equally emphasized in Sanders' campaignas in Clinton's.  Finally, we suggest two ways that politicians can use the feedback mechanismin social media to improve their campaign: (1) use feedback from social mediato improve campaign tactics within social media; (2) prototype policies andtest the public response from the social media.

Deep Multimodal Representation Learning from Temporal Data

  In recent years, Deep Learning has been successfully applied to multimodallearning problems, with the aim of learning useful joint representations indata fusion applications. When the available modalities consist of time seriesdata such as video, audio and sensor signals, it becomes imperative to considertheir temporal structure during the fusion process. In this paper, we proposethe Correlational Recurrent Neural Network (CorrRNN), a novel temporal fusionmodel for fusing multiple input modalities that are inherently temporal innature. Key features of our proposed model include: (i) simultaneous learningof the joint representation and temporal dependencies between modalities, (ii)use of multiple loss terms in the objective function, including a maximumcorrelation loss term to enhance learning of cross-modal information, and (iii)the use of an attention model to dynamically adjust the contribution ofdifferent input modalities to the joint representation. We validate our modelvia experimentation on two different tasks: video- and sensor-based activityclassification, and audio-visual speech recognition. We empirically analyze thecontributions of different components of the proposed CorrRNN model, anddemonstrate its robustness, effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance onmultiple datasets.

How Polarized Have We Become? A Multimodal Classification of Trump  Followers and Clinton Followers

  Polarization in American politics has been extensively documented andanalyzed for decades, and the phenomenon became all the more apparent duringthe 2016 presidential election, where Trump and Clinton depicted two radicallydifferent pictures of America. Inspired by this gaping polarization and theextensive utilization of Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign, in thispaper we take the first step in measuring polarization in social media and weattempt to predict individuals' Twitter following behavior through analyzingones' everyday tweets, profile images and posted pictures. As such, we treatpolarization as a classification problem and study to what extent Trumpfollowers and Clinton followers on Twitter can be distinguished, which in turnserves as a metric of polarization in general. We apply LSTM to processingtweet features and we extract visual features using the VGG neural network.Integrating these two sets of features boosts the overall performance. We areable to achieve an accuracy of 69%, suggesting that the high degree ofpolarization recorded in the literature has started to manifest itself insocial media as well.

When Celebrities Endorse Politicians: Analyzing the Behavior of  Celebrity Followers in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election

  Thanks to their name recognition and popularity, celebrities play animportant role in American politics. Celebrity endorsements could add to themomentum of a politician's campaign and win the candidate extensive mediacoverage. There is one caveat though: the political preference of celebrityfollowers might differ from that of the celebrity. In this paper we explorethat possibility. By carefully studying six prominent endorsements to theleading presidential candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election andstatistically modeling Twitter "follow" behavior, we show (1) followers of allthe celebrities with the exception of Lady Gaga are more likely to follow alarge number of candidates and (2) the opinion of celebrity followers couldsystematically differ from that of the celebrity. Our methodology can begeneralized to the study of such events as NBA players' refusing to visit theWhite House and pop singers' meeting with Dalai Lama.

Boundary-based Image Forgery Detection by Fast Shallow CNN

  Image forgery detection is the task of detecting and localizing forged partsin tampered images. Previous works mostly focus on high resolution images usingtraces of resampling features, demosaicing features or sharpness of edges.However, a good detection method should also be applicable to low resolutionimages because compressed or resized images are common these days. To this end,we propose a Shallow Convolutional Neural Network(SCNN), capable ofdistinguishing the boundaries of forged regions from original edges in lowresolution images. SCNN is designed to utilize the information of chroma andsaturation. Based on SCNN, two approaches that are named Sliding WindowsDetection (SWD) and Fast SCNN, respectively, are developed to detect andlocalize image forgery region. In this paper, we substantiate that Fast SCNNcan detect drastic change of chroma and saturation. In image forgery detectionexperiments Our model is evaluated on the CASIA 2.0 dataset. The results showthat Fast SCNN performs well on low resolution images and achieves significantimprovements over the state-of-the-art.

Image Captioning at Will: A Versatile Scheme for Effectively Injecting  Sentiments into Image Descriptions

  Automatic image captioning has recently approached human-level performancedue to the latest advances in computer vision and natural languageunderstanding. However, most of the current models can only generate plainfactual descriptions about the content of a given image. However, for humanbeings, image caption writing is quite flexible and diverse, where additionallanguage dimensions, such as emotion, humor and language styles, are oftenincorporated to produce diverse, emotional, or appealing captions. Inparticular, we are interested in generating sentiment-conveying imagedescriptions, which has received little attention. The main challenge is how toeffectively inject sentiments into the generated captions without altering thesemantic matching between the visual content and the generated descriptions. Inthis work, we propose two different models, which employ different schemes forinjecting sentiments into image captions. Compared with the few existingapproaches, the proposed models are much simpler and yet more effective. Theexperimental results show that our model outperform the state-of-the-art modelsin generating sentimental (i.e., sentiment-bearing) image captions. Inaddition, we can also easily manipulate the model by assigning differentsentiments to the testing image to generate captions with the correspondingsentiments.

The Great Division

  When information flow fails, when Democrats and Republicans do not talk toeach other, when Israelis and Palestinians do not talk to each other, and whenNorth Koreans and South Koreans do not talk to each other, mis-perceptions,biases and fake news arise. In this paper we present an in-depth study ofpolitical polarization and social division using Twitter data and Monte Carlosimulations. First, we study at the aggregate level people's inclination toretweet within their own ideological circle. Introducing the concept of cocoonratio, we show that Donald Trump's followers are 2.56 more likely to retweet afellow Trump follower than to retweet a Hillary Clinton follower. Second, goingdown to the individual level, we show that the tendency of retweetingexclusively within one's ideological circle is stronger for women than for menand that such tendency weakens as one's social capital grows. Third, we use aone-dimensional Ising model to simulate how a society with high cocoon ratioscould end up becoming completely divided. We conclude with a discussion of ourfindings with respect to fake news.

VizWiz Grand Challenge: Answering Visual Questions from Blind People

  The study of algorithms to automatically answer visual questions currently ismotivated by visual question answering (VQA) datasets constructed in artificialVQA settings. We propose VizWiz, the first goal-oriented VQA dataset arisingfrom a natural VQA setting. VizWiz consists of over 31,000 visual questionsoriginating from blind people who each took a picture using a mobile phone andrecorded a spoken question about it, together with 10 crowdsourced answers pervisual question. VizWiz differs from the many existing VQA datasets because (1)images are captured by blind photographers and so are often poor quality, (2)questions are spoken and so are more conversational, and (3) often visualquestions cannot be answered. Evaluation of modern algorithms for answeringvisual questions and deciding if a visual question is answerable reveals thatVizWiz is a challenging dataset. We introduce this dataset to encourage alarger community to develop more generalized algorithms that can assist blindpeople.

Sleep-deprived Fatigue Pattern Analysis using Large-Scale Selfies from  Social Med

  The complexities of fatigue have drawn much attention from researchers acrossvarious disciplines. Short-term fatigue may cause safety issue while driving;thus, dynamic systems were designed to track driver fatigue. Long-term fatiguecould lead to chronic syndromes, and eventually affect individuals physical andpsychological health. Traditional methodologies of evaluating fatigue not onlyrequire sophisticated equipment but also consume enormous time. In this paper,we attempt to develop a novel and efficient method to predict individual'sfatigue rate by scrutinizing human facial cues. Our goal is to predict fatiguerate based on a selfie. To associate the fatigue rate with user behaviors, wehave collected nearly 1-million timeline posts from 10,480 users on Instagram.We first detect all the faces and identify their demographics using automaticalgorithms. Next, we investigate the fatigue distribution by weekday overdifferent age, gender, and ethnic groups. This work represents a promising wayto assess sleep-deprived fatigue, and our study provides a viable and efficientcomputational framework for user fatigue modeling in large-scale via socialmedia.

Touch Your Heart: A Tone-aware Chatbot for Customer Care on Social Media

  Chatbot has become an important solution to rapidly increasing customer caredemands on social media in recent years. However, current work on chatbot forcustomer care ignores a key to impact user experience - tones. In this work, wecreate a novel tone-aware chatbot that generates toned responses to userrequests on social media. We first conduct a formative research, in which theeffects of tones are studied. Significant and various influences of differenttones on user experience are uncovered in the study. With the knowledge ofeffects of tones, we design a deep learning based chatbot that takes toneinformation into account. We train our system on over 1.5 million real customercare conversations collected from Twitter. The evaluation reveals that ourtone-aware chatbot generates as appropriate responses to user requests as humanagents. More importantly, our chatbot is perceived to be even more empatheticthan human agents.

VQA-E: Explaining, Elaborating, and Enhancing Your Answers for Visual  Questions

  Most existing works in visual question answering (VQA) are dedicated toimproving the accuracy of predicted answers, while disregarding theexplanations. We argue that the explanation for an answer is of the same oreven more importance compared with the answer itself, since it makes thequestion and answering process more understandable and traceable. To this end,we propose a new task of VQA-E (VQA with Explanation), where the computationalmodels are required to generate an explanation with the predicted answer. Wefirst construct a new dataset, and then frame the VQA-E problem in a multi-tasklearning architecture. Our VQA-E dataset is automatically derived from the VQAv2 dataset by intelligently exploiting the available captions. We haveconducted a user study to validate the quality of explanations synthesized byour method. We quantitatively show that the additional supervision fromexplanations can not only produce insightful textual sentences to justify theanswers, but also improve the performance of answer prediction. Our modeloutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on the VQA v2dataset.

Life in the "Matrix": Human Mobility Patterns in the Cyber Space

  With the wide adoption of the multi-community setting in many popular socialmedia platforms, the increasing user engagements across multiple onlinecommunities warrant research attention. In this paper, we introduce a novelanalogy between the movements in the cyber space and the physical space. Thisanalogy implies a new way of studying human online activities by modelling theactivities across online communities in a similar fashion as the movementsamong locations. First, we quantitatively validate the analogy by comparingseveral important properties of human online activities and physical movements.Our experiments reveal striking similarities between the cyber space and thephysical space. Next, inspired by the established methodology on human mobilityin the physical space, we propose a framework to study human "mobility" acrossonline platforms. We discover three interesting patterns of user engagements inonline communities. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that people withdifferent mobility patterns also exhibit divergent preferences to onlinecommunities. This work not only attempts to achieve a better understanding ofhuman online activities, but also intends to open a promising researchdirection with rich implications and applications.

Mining the Relationship between Emoji Usage Patterns and Personality

  Emojis have been widely used in textual communications as a new way to conveynonverbal cues. An interesting observation is the various emoji usage patternsamong different users. In this paper, we investigate the correlation betweenuser personality traits and their emoji usage patterns, particularly on overallamounts and specific preferences. To achieve this goal, we build a largeTwitter dataset which includes 352,245 users and over 1.13 billion tweetsassociated with calculated personality traits and emoji usage patterns. Ourcorrelation and emoji prediction results provide insights into the power ofdiverse personalities that lead to varies emoji usage patterns as well as itspotential in emoji recommendation tasks.

Online Deep Metric Learning

  Metric learning learns a metric function from training data to calculate thesimilarity or distance between samples. From the perspective of featurelearning, metric learning essentially learns a new feature space by featuretransformation (e.g., Mahalanobis distance metric). However, traditional metriclearning algorithms are shallow, which just learn one metric space (featuretransformation). Can we further learn a better metric space from the learntmetric space? In other words, can we learn metric progressively and nonlinearlylike deep learning by just using the existing metric learning algorithms? Tothis end, we present a hierarchical metric learning scheme and implement anonline deep metric learning framework, namely ODML. Specifically, we take oneonline metric learning algorithm as a metric layer, followed by a nonlinearlayer (i.e., ReLU), and then stack these layers modelled after the deeplearning. The proposed ODML enjoys some nice properties, indeed can learnmetric progressively and performs superiorly on some datasets. Variousexperiments with different settings have been conducted to verify theseproperties of the proposed ODML.

Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Bi-sense Emoji Embedding and  Attention-based LSTM

  Sentiment analysis on large-scale social media data is important to bridgethe gaps between social media contents and real world activities includingpolitical election prediction, individual and public emotional statusmonitoring and analysis, and so on. Although textual sentiment analysis hasbeen well studied based on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, analysis ofthe role of extensive emoji uses in sentiment analysis remains light. In thispaper, we propose a novel scheme for Twitter sentiment analysis with extraattention on emojis. We first learn bi-sense emoji embeddings under positiveand negative sentimental tweets individually, and then train a sentimentclassifier by attending on these bi-sense emoji embeddings with anattention-based long short-term memory network (LSTM). Our experiments showthat the bi-sense embedding is effective for extracting sentiment-awareembeddings of emojis and outperforms the state-of-the-art models. We alsovisualize the attentions to show that the bi-sense emoji embedding providesbetter guidance on the attention mechanism to obtain a more robustunderstanding of the semantics and sentiments.

Attentive Relational Networks for Mapping Images to Scene Graphs

  Scene graph generation refers to the task of automatically mapping an imageinto a semantic structural graph, which requires correctly labeling eachextracted object and their interaction relationships. Despite the recentsuccess in object detection using deep learning techniques, inferring complexcontextual relationships and structured graph representations from visual dataremains a challenging topic. In this study, we propose a novel AttentiveRelational Network that consists of two key modules with an object detectionbackbone to approach this problem. The first module is a semantictransformation module utilized to capture semantic embedded relation features,by translating visual features and linguistic features into a common semanticspace. The other module is a graph self-attention module introduced to embed ajoint graph representation through assigning various importance weights toneighboring nodes. Finally, accurate scene graphs are produced by the relationinference module to recognize all entities and the corresponding relations. Weevaluate our proposed method on the widely-adopted Visual Genome Dataset, andthe results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

Face Completion with Semantic Knowledge and Collaborative Adversarial  Learning

  Unlike a conventional background inpainting approach that infers a missingarea from image patches similar to the background, face completion requiressemantic knowledge about the target object for realistic outputs. Current imageinpainting approaches utilize generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achievesuch semantic understanding. However, in adversarial learning, the semanticknowledge is learned implicitly and hence good semantic understanding is notalways guaranteed. In this work, we propose a collaborative adversariallearning approach to face completion to explicitly induce the training process.Our method is formulated under a novel generative framework calledcollaborative GAN (collaGAN), which allows better semantic understanding of atarget object through collaborative learning of multiple tasks including facecompletion, landmark detection, and semantic segmentation. Together with thecollaGAN, we also introduce an inpainting concentrated scheme such that themodel emphasizes more on inpainting instead of autoencoding. Extensiveexperiments show that the proposed designs are indeed effective andcollaborative adversarial learning provides better feature representations ofthe faces. In comparison with other generative image inpainting models andsingle task learning methods, our solution produces superior performances onall tasks.

Adversarial Sparse-View CBCT Artifact Reduction

  We present an effective post-processing method to reduce the artifacts fromsparsely reconstructed cone-beam CT (CBCT) images. The proposed method is basedon the state-of-the-art, image-to-image generative models with a perceptualloss as regulation. Unlike the traditional CT artifact-reduction approaches,our method is trained in an adversarial fashion that yields more perceptuallyrealistic outputs while preserving the anatomical structures. To address thestreak artifacts that are inherently local and appear across various scales, wefurther propose a novel discriminator architecture based on feature pyramidnetworks and a differentially modulated focus map to induce the adversarialtraining. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can greatlycorrect the cone-beam artifacts from clinical CBCT images reconstructed using1/3 projections, and outperforms strong baseline methods both quantitativelyand qualitatively.
