Path integral formulation of stochastic optimal control with generalized
  costs

  Path integral control solves a class of stochastic optimal control problems
with a Monte Carlo (MC) method for an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
equation. The MC approach avoids the need for a global grid of the domain of
the HJB equation and, therefore, path integral control is in principle
applicable to control problems of moderate to large dimension. The class of
problems path integral control can solve, however, is defined by requirements
on the cost function, the noise covariance matrix and the control input matrix.
We relax the requirements on the cost function by introducing a new state that
represents an augmented running cost. In our new formulation the cost function
can contain stochastic integral terms and linear control costs, which are
important in applications in engineering, economics and finance. We find an
efficient numerical implementation of our grid-free MC approach and demonstrate
its performance and usefulness in examples from hierarchical electric load
management. The dimension of one of our examples is large enough to make
classical grid-based HJB solvers impractical.


Learning Quadrotor Dynamics Using Neural Network for Flight Control

  Traditional learning approaches proposed for controlling quadrotors or
helicopters have focused on improving performance for specific trajectories by
iteratively improving upon a nominal controller, for example learning from
demonstrations, iterative learning, and reinforcement learning. In these
schemes, however, it is not clear how the information gathered from the
training trajectories can be used to synthesize controllers for more general
trajectories. Recently, the efficacy of deep learning in inferring helicopter
dynamics has been shown. Motivated by the generalization capability of deep
learning, this paper investigates whether a neural network based dynamics model
can be employed to synthesize control for trajectories different than those
used for training. To test this, we learn a quadrotor dynamics model using only
translational and only rotational training trajectories, each of which can be
controlled independently, and then use it to simultaneously control the yaw and
position of a quadrotor, which is non-trivial because of nonlinear couplings
between the two motions. We validate our approach in experiments on a quadrotor
testbed.


A sampling-based approach to scalable constraint satisfaction in linear
  sampled-data systems---Part I: Computation

  Sampled-data (SD) systems, which are composed of both discrete- and
continuous-time components, are arguably one of the most common classes of
cyberphysical systems in practice; most modern controllers are implemented on
digital platforms while the plant dynamics that are being controlled evolve
continuously in time. As with all cyberphysical systems, ensuring hard
constraint satisfaction is key in the safe operation of SD systems. A powerful
analytical tool for guaranteeing such constraint satisfaction is the viability
kernel: the set of all initial conditions for which a safety-preserving control
law (that is, a control law that satisfies all input and state constraints)
exists. In this paper we present a novel sampling-based algorithm that tightly
approximates the viability kernel for high-dimensional sampled-data linear
time-invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike prior work in this area, our algorithm
formally handles both the discrete and continuous characteristics of SD
systems. We prove the correctness and convergence of our approximation
technique, provide discussions on heuristic methods to optimally bias the
sampling process, and demonstrate the results on a twelve-dimensional flight
envelope protection problem.


Secure Estimation based Kalman Filter for Cyber-Physical Systems against
  Adversarial Attacks

  Cyber-physical systems are found in many applications such as power networks,
manufacturing processes, and air and ground transportation systems. Maintaining
security of these systems under cyber attacks is an important and challenging
task, since these attacks can be erratic and thus difficult to model. Secure
estimation problems study how to estimate the true system states when
measurements are corrupted and/or control inputs are compromised by attackers.
The authors in [1] proposed a secure estimation method when the set of attacked
nodes (sensors, controllers) is fixed. In this paper, we extend these results
to scenarios in which the set of attacked nodes can change over time. We
formulate this secure estimation problem into the classical error correction
problem [2] and we show that accurate decoding can be guaranteed under a
certain condition. Furthermore, we propose a combined secure estimation method
with our proposed secure estimator and the Kalman Filter for improved practical
performance. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our method through
simulations of two scenarios where an unmanned aerial vehicle is under
adversarial attack.


Secure Estimation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles against Adversarial Cyber
  Attacks

  In the coming years, usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is expected to
grow tremendously. Maintaining security of UAVs under cyber attacks is an
important yet challenging task, as these attacks are often erratic and
difficult to predict. Secure estimation problems study how to estimate the
states of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and maliciously corrupted
sensor measurements. The fewer assumptions that an estimator makes about the
attacker, the larger the set of attacks it can protect the system against. In
this paper, we focus on sensor attacks on UAVs and attempt to design a secure
estimator for linear time-invariant systems based on as few assumptions about
the attackers as possible. We propose a computationally efficient estimator
that protects the system against arbitrary and unbounded attacks, where the set
of attacked sensors can also change over time. In addition, we propose to
combine our secure estimator with a Kalman Filter for improved practical
performance and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations of two
scenarios where an UAV is under adversarial cyber attack.


Plug-and-Play Model Predictive Control for Load Shaping and Voltage
  Control in Smart Grids

  This paper presents a predictive controller for handling plug-and-play (P&P)
charging requests of flexible loads in a distribution system. We define two
types of flexible loads: (i) deferrable loads that have a fixed power profile
but can be deferred in time and (ii) shapeable loads that have flexible power
profiles but fixed energy requests, such as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs).
The proposed method uses a hierarchical control scheme based on a model
predictive control (MPC) formulation for minimizing the global system cost. The
first stage computes a reachable reference that trades off deviation from the
nominal voltage with the required generation control. The second stage uses a
price-based objective to aggregate flexible loads and provide load shaping
services, while satisfying system constraints and users' preferences at all
times. It is shown that the proposed controller is recursively feasible under
specific conditions, i.e. the flexible load demands are satisfied and bus
voltages remain within the desired limits. Finally, the proposed scheme is
illustrated on a 55 bus radial distribution network.


Dynamic Contracts with Partial Observations: Application to Indirect
  Load Control

  This paper proposes a method to design an optimal dynamic contract between a
principal and an agent, who has the authority to control both the principal's
revenue and an engineered system. The key characteristic of our problem setting
is that the principal has very limited information: the principal has no
capability to monitor the agent's control or the state of the engineered
system. The agent has perfect observations. With this asymmetry of information,
we show that the principal can induce the agent to control both the revenue and
the system processes in a way that maximizes the principal's utility, if the
principal offers appropriate real-time and end-time compensation. We
reformulate the dynamic contract design problem as a stochastic optimal control
of both the engineered system and the agent's future expected payoff, which can
be numerically solved using an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The
performance and usefulness of the proposed contract are demonstrated with an
indirect load control problem.


Safe Sequential Path Planning Under Disturbances and Imperfect
  Information

  Multi-UAV systems are safety-critical, and guarantees must be made to ensure
no unsafe configurations occur. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is ideal for
analyzing such safety-critical systems; however, its direct application is
limited to small-scale systems of no more than two vehicles due to an
exponentially-scaling computational complexity. Previously, the sequential path
planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to vehicles, was
proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be done with a
linearly-scaling computational complexity. However, the previous formulation
assumed that there are no disturbances, and that every vehicle has perfect
knowledge of higher-priority vehicles' positions. In this paper, we make SPP
more practical by providing three different methods to account for disturbances
in dynamics and imperfect knowledge of higher-priority vehicles' states. Each
method has different assumptions about information sharing. We demonstrate our
proposed methods in simulations.


Building Model Identification during Regular Operation - Empirical
  Results and Challenges

  The inter-temporal consumption flexibility of commercial buildings can be
harnessed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, or to provide
ancillary service to the power grid. To do so, a predictive model of the
building's thermal dynamics is required. In this paper, we identify a
physics-based model of a multi-purpose commercial building including its
heating, ventilation and air conditioning system during regular operation. We
present our empirical results and show that large uncertainties in internal
heat gains, due to occupancy and equipment, present several challenges in
utilizing the building model for long-term prediction. In addition, we show
that by learning these uncertain loads online and dynamically updating the
building model, prediction accuracy is improved significantly.


Secure State Estimation for Nonlinear Power Systems under Cyber Attacks

  This paper focuses on securely estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamical
system from a set of corrupted measurements. In particular, we consider two
broad classes of nonlinear systems, and propose a technique which enables us to
perform secure state estimation for such nonlinear systems. We then provide
guarantees on the achievable state estimation error against arbitrary
corruptions, and analytically characterize the number of errors that can be
perfectly corrected by a decoder. To illustrate how the proposed nonlinear
estimation approach can be applied to practical systems, we focus on secure
estimation for the wide area control of an interconnected power system under
cyber-physical attacks and communication failures, and propose a secure
estimator for the power system. Finally, we numerically show that the proposed
secure estimation algorithm enables us to reconstruct the attack signals
accurately.


On the Powerball Method for Optimization

  We propose a new method to accelerate the convergence of optimization
algorithms. This method simply adds a power coefficient $\gamma\in[0,1)$ to the
gradient during optimization. We call this the Powerball method and analyze the
convergence rate for the Powerball method for strongly convex functions. While
theoretically the Powerball method is guaranteed to have a linear convergence
rate in the same order of the gradient method, we show that empirically it
significantly outperforms the gradient descent and Newton's method, especially
during the initial iterations. We demonstrate that the Powerball method
provides a $10$-fold speedup of the convergence of both gradient descent and
L-BFGS on multiple real datasets.


On the Optimal Solutions of the Infinite-Horizon Linear Sensor
  Scheduling Problem

  This paper studies the infinite-horizon sensor scheduling problem for linear
Gaussian processes with linear measurement functions. Several important
properties of the optimal infinite-horizon schedules are derived. In
particular, it is proved that under some mild conditions, both the optimal
infinite-horizon average-per-stage cost and the corresponding optimal sensor
schedules are independent of the covariance matrix of the initial state. It is
also proved that the optimal estimation cost can be approximated arbitrarily
closely by a periodic schedule with a finite period. Moreover, it is shown that
the sequence of the average-per-stage costs of the optimal schedule must
converge. These theoretical results provide valuable insights into the design
and analysis of various infinite-horizon sensor scheduling algorithms.


Stability Analysis of Wholesale Electricity Markets under Dynamic
  Consumption Models and Real-Time Pricing

  This paper analyzes stability conditions for wholesale electricity markets
under real-time retail pricing and realistic consumption models with memory,
which explicitly take into account previous electricity prices and consumption
levels. By passing on the current retail price of electricity from supplier to
consumer and feeding the observed consumption back to the supplier, a
closed-loop dynamical system for electricity prices and consumption arises
whose stability is to be investigated. Under mild assumptions on the generation
cost of electricity and consumers' backlog disutility functions, we show that,
for consumer models with price memory only, market stability is achieved if the
ratio between the consumers' marginal backlog disutility and the suppliers'
marginal cost of supply remains below a fixed threshold. Further, consumer
models with price and consumption memory can result in greater stability
regions and faster convergence to the equilibrium compared to models with price
memory alone, if consumption deviations from nominal demand are adequately
penalized.


Multiplayer Reach-Avoid Games via Pairwise Outcomes

  A multiplayer reach-avoid game is a differential game between an attacking
team with NA attackers and a defending team with ND defenders playing on a
compact domain with obstacles. The attacking team aims to send M of the NA
attackers to some target location, while the defending team aims to prevent
that by capturing attackers or indefinitely delaying attackers from reaching
the target. Although the analysis of this game plays an important role in many
applications, the optimal solution to this game is computationally intractable
when NA>1 or ND>1. In this paper, we present two approaches for the NA=ND=1
case to determine pairwise outcomes, and a graph theoretic maximum matching
approach to merge these pairwise outcomes for an NA,ND>1 solution that provides
guarantees on the performance of the defending team. We will show that the
four-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach allows for real-time updates
to the maximum matching, and that the two-dimensional "path defense" approach
is considerably more scalable with the number of players while maintaining
defender performance guarantees.


Using Neural Networks to Compute Approximate and Guaranteed Feasible
  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE Solutions

  To sidestep the curse of dimensionality when computing solutions to
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations (HJB PDE), we propose an
algorithm that leverages a neural network to approximate the value function. We
show that our final approximation of the value function generates near optimal
controls which are guaranteed to successfully drive the system to a target
state. Our framework is not dependent on state space discretization, leading to
a significant reduction in computation time and space complexity in comparison
with dynamic programming-based approaches. Using this grid-free approach also
enables us to plan over longer time horizons with relatively little additional
computation overhead. Unlike many previous neural network HJB PDE approximating
formulations, our approximation is strictly conservative and hence any
trajectories we generate will be strictly feasible. For demonstration, we
specialize our new general framework to the Dubins car model and discuss how
the framework can be applied to other models with higher-dimensional state
spaces.


Hedging Strategies for Load-Serving Entities in Wholesale Electricity
  Markets

  Load-serving entities which procure electricity from the wholesale
electricity market to service end-users face significant quantity and price
risks due to the volatile nature of electricity demand and quasi-fixed
residential tariffs at which electricity is sold. This paper investigates
strategies for load serving entities to hedge against such price risks.
Specifically, we compute profit-maximizing portfolios of forward contract and
call options as a function of the uncertain aggregate user demand. We compare
the profit to the case of Demand Response, where users are offered monetary
incentives to temporarily reduce their consumption during periods of supply
shortages. Using smart meter data of residential customers in California, we
simulate optimal portfolios and derive conditions under which Demand Response
outperforms call options and forward contracts.


How Peer Effects Influence Energy Consumption

  This paper analyzes the impact of peer effects on electricity consumption of
a network of rational, utility-maximizing users. Users derive utility from
consuming electricity as well as consuming less energy than their neighbors.
However, a disutility is incurred for consuming more than their neighbors. To
maximize the profit of the load-serving entity that provides electricity to
such users, we develop a two-stage game-theoretic model, where the entity sets
the prices in the first stage. In the second stage, consumers decide on their
demand in response to the observed price set in the first stage so as to
maximize their utility. To this end, we derive theoretical statements under
which such peer effects reduce aggregate user consumption. Further, we obtain
expressions for the resulting electricity consumption and profit of the load
serving entity for the case of perfect price discrimination and a single price
under complete information, and approximations under incomplete information.
Simulations suggest that exposing only a selected subset of all users to peer
effects maximizes the entity's profit.


FaSTrack: a Modular Framework for Fast and Guaranteed Safe Motion
  Planning

  Fast and safe navigation of dynamical systems through a priori unknown
cluttered environments is vital to many applications of autonomous systems.
However, trajectory planning for autonomous systems is computationally
intensive, often requiring simplified dynamics that sacrifice safety and
dynamic feasibility in order to plan efficiently. Conversely, safe trajectories
can be computed using more sophisticated dynamic models, but this is typically
too slow to be used for real-time planning. We propose a new algorithm
FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking for High Dimensional systems. A path or
trajectory planner using simplified dynamics to plan quickly can be
incorporated into the FaSTrack framework, which provides a safety controller
for the vehicle along with a guaranteed tracking error bound. This bound
captures all possible deviations due to high dimensional dynamics and external
disturbances. Note that FaSTrack is modular and can be used with most current
path or trajectory planners. We demonstrate this framework using a 10D
nonlinear quadrotor model tracking a 3D path obtained from an RRT planner.


A Hybrid Framework for Multi-Vehicle Collision Avoidance

  With the recent surge of interest in UAVs for civilian services, the
importance of developing tractable multi-agent analysis techniques that provide
safety and performance guarantees have drastically increased. Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) reachability has successfully provided these guarantees to small-scale
systems and is flexible in terms of system dynamics. However, the exponential
complexity scaling of HJ reachability with respect to system dimension prevents
its direct application to larger-scale problems where the number of vehicles is
greater than two. In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance algorithm
using a hybrid framework for N+1 vehicles through higher-level control logic
given any N-vehicle collision avoidance algorithm. Our algorithm conservatively
approximates a guaranteed-safe region in the joint state space of the N+1
vehicles and produces a safety-preserving controller. In addition, our
algorithm does not incur significant additional computation cost. We
demonstrate our proposed method in simulation.


Goal-Driven Dynamics Learning via Bayesian Optimization

  Real-world robots are becoming increasingly complex and commonly act in
poorly understood environments where it is extremely challenging to model or
learn their true dynamics. Therefore, it might be desirable to take a
task-specific approach, wherein the focus is on explicitly learning the
dynamics model which achieves the best control performance for the task at
hand, rather than learning the true dynamics. In this work, we use Bayesian
optimization in an active learning framework where a locally linear dynamics
model is learned with the intent of maximizing the control performance, and
used in conjunction with optimal control schemes to efficiently design a
controller for a given task. This model is updated directly based on the
performance observed in experiments on the physical system in an iterative
manner until a desired performance is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach through simulations and real experiments on a quadrotor
testbed.


Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability: A Brief Overview and Recent Advances

  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is an important formal
verification method for guaranteeing performance and safety properties of
dynamical systems; it has been applied to many small-scale systems in the past
decade. Its advantages include compatibility with general nonlinear system
dynamics, formal treatment of bounded disturbances, and the availability of
well-developed numerical tools. The main challenge is addressing its
exponential computational complexity with respect to the number of state
variables. In this tutorial, we present an overview of basic HJ reachability
theory and provide instructions for using the most recent numerical tools,
including an efficient GPU-parallelized implementation of a Level Set Toolbox
for computing reachable sets. In addition, we review some of the current work
in high-dimensional HJ reachability to show how the dimensionality challenge
can be alleviated via various general theoretical and application-specific
insights.


Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Residential Demand
  Response

  We evaluate the causal effect of hour-ahead price interventions on the
reduction in residential electricity consumption using a data set from a
large-scale experiment on 7,000 households in California. By estimating
user-level counterfactuals using time-series prediction, we estimate an average
treatment effect of ~0.10 kWh (11%) per intervention and household. Next, we
leverage causal decision trees to detect treatment effect heterogeneity across
users by incorporating census data. These decision trees depart from
classification and regression trees, as we intend to estimate a causal effect
between treated and control units rather than perform outcome regression. We
compare the performance of causal decision trees with a simpler, yet more
inaccurate k-means clustering approach that naively detects heterogeneity in
the feature space, confirming the superiority of causal decision trees. Lastly,
we comment on how our methods to detect heterogeneity can be used for targeting
households to improve cost efficiency.


Planning, Fast and Slow: A Framework for Adaptive Real-Time Safe
  Trajectory Planning

  Motion planning is an extremely well-studied problem in the robotics
community, yet existing work largely falls into one of two categories:
computationally efficient but with few if any safety guarantees, or able to
give stronger guarantees but at high computational cost. This work builds on a
recent development called FaSTrack in which a slow offline computation provides
a modular safety guarantee for a faster online planner. We introduce the notion
of "meta-planning" in which a refined offline computation enables safe
switching between different online planners. This provides autonomous systems
with the ability to adapt motion plans to a priori unknown environments in
real-time as sensor measurements detect new obstacles, and the flexibility to
maneuver differently in the presence of obstacles than they would in free
space, all while maintaining a strict safety guarantee. We demonstrate the
meta-planning algorithm both in simulation and in hardware using a small
Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor.


Budget-Constrained Multi-Armed Bandits with Multiple Plays

  We study the multi-armed bandit problem with multiple plays and a budget
constraint for both the stochastic and the adversarial setting. At each round,
exactly $K$ out of $N$ possible arms have to be played (with $1\leq K \leq N$).
In addition to observing the individual rewards for each arm played, the player
also learns a vector of costs which has to be covered with an a-priori defined
budget $B$. The game ends when the sum of current costs associated with the
played arms exceeds the remaining budget.
  Firstly, we analyze this setting for the stochastic case, for which we assume
each arm to have an underlying cost and reward distribution with support
$[c_{\min}, 1]$ and $[0, 1]$, respectively. We derive an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm which achieves $O(NK^4 \log B)$ regret.
  Secondly, for the adversarial case in which the entire sequence of rewards
and costs is fixed in advance, we derive an upper bound on the regret of order
$O(\sqrt{NB\log(N/K)})$ utilizing an extension of the well-known
$\texttt{Exp3}$ algorithm. We also provide upper bounds that hold with high
probability and a lower bound of order $\Omega((1 - K/N)^2 \sqrt{NB/K})$.


Context-Specific Validation of Data-Driven Models

  With an increasing use of data-driven models to control robotic systems, it
has become important to develop a methodology for validating such models before
they can be deployed to design a controller for the actual system.
Specifically, it must be ensured that the controller designed for a learned
model would perform as expected on the actual physical system. We propose a
context-specific validation framework to quantify the quality of a learned
model based on a distance measure between the closed-loop actual system and the
learned model. We then propose an active sampling scheme to compute a
probabilistic upper bound on this distance in a sample-efficient manner. The
proposed framework validates the learned model against only those behaviors of
the system that are relevant for the purpose for which we intend to use this
model, and does not require any a priori knowledge of the system dynamics.
Several simulations illustrate the practicality of the proposed framework for
validating the models of real-world systems, and consequently, for controller
synthesis.


Classification-based Approximate Reachability with Guarantees Applied to
  Safe Trajectory Tracking

  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has been developed over the past
decades into a widely-applicable tool for determining goal satisfaction and
safety verification in nonlinear systems. While HJ reachability can be
formulated very generally, computational complexity can be a serious impediment
for many systems of practical interest. Much prior work has been devoted to
computing approximate solutions to large reachability problems, yet many of
these methods apply to only restricted problem classes, do not generate
controllers, and/or are extremely conservative. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to approximate HJ reachability in which computing an optimal
controller is viewed as a sequential classification problem. Even though we
employ neural networks for this classification task, our method still provides
safety guarantees in many cases. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in
the context of safe trajectory following with specific application to quadrotor
navigation. Offline computation and online evaluation confirm that our method
preserves safety.


Probabilistically Safe Robot Planning with Confidence-Based Human
  Predictions

  In order to safely operate around humans, robots can employ predictive models
of human motion. Unfortunately, these models cannot capture the full complexity
of human behavior and necessarily introduce simplifying assumptions. As a
result, predictions may degrade whenever the observed human behavior departs
from the assumed structure, which can have negative implications for safety. In
this paper, we observe that how "rational" human actions appear under a
particular model can be viewed as an indicator of that model's ability to
describe the human's current motion. By reasoning about this model confidence
in a real-time Bayesian framework, we show that the robot can very quickly
modulate its predictions to become more uncertain when the model performs
poorly. Building on recent work in provably-safe trajectory planning, we
leverage these confidence-aware human motion predictions to generate assured
autonomous robot motion. Our new analysis combines worst-case tracking error
guarantees for the physical robot with probabilistic time-varying human
predictions, yielding a quantitative, probabilistic safety certificate. We
demonstrate our approach with a quadcopter navigating around a human.


A Minimum Discounted Reward Hamilton-Jacobi Formulation for Computing
  Reachable Sets

  We propose a novel formulation for approximating reachable sets through a
minimum discounted reward optimal control problem. The formulation yields a
continuous solution that can be obtained by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
Furthermore, the numerical approximation to this solution can be obtained as
the unique fixed-point to a contraction mapping. This allows for more efficient
solution methods that could not be applied under traditional formulations for
solving reachable sets. In addition, this formulation provides a link between
reinforcement learning and learning reachable sets for systems with unknown
dynamics, allowing algorithms from the former to be applied to the latter. We
use two benchmark examples, double integrator, and pursuit-evasion games, to
show the correctness of the formulation as well as its strengths in comparison
to previous work.


A Scalable Framework For Real-Time Multi-Robot, Multi-Human Collision
  Avoidance

  Robust motion planning is a well-studied problem in the robotics literature,
yet current algorithms struggle to operate scalably and safely in the presence
of other moving agents, such as humans. This paper introduces a novel framework
for robot navigation that accounts for high-order system dynamics and maintains
safety in the presence of external disturbances, other robots, and
non-deterministic intentional agents. Our approach precomputes a tracking error
margin for each robot, generates confidence-aware human motion predictions, and
coordinates multiple robots with a sequential priority ordering, effectively
enabling scalable safe trajectory planning and execution. We demonstrate our
approach in hardware with two robots and two humans. We also showcase our
work's scalability in a larger simulation.


Safely Probabilistically Complete Real-Time Planning and Exploration in
  Unknown Environments

  We present a new framework for motion planning that wraps around existing
kinodynamic planners and guarantees recursive feasibility when operating in a
priori unknown, static environments. Our approach makes strong guarantees about
overall safety and collision avoidance by utilizing a robust controller derived
from reachability analysis. We ensure that motion plans never exit the safe
backward reachable set of the initial state, while safely exploring the space.
This preserves the safety of the initial state, and guarantees that that we
will eventually find the goal if it is possible to do so while exploring
safely. We implement our framework in the Robot Operating System (ROS) software
environment and demonstrate it in a real-time simulation.


Identification of Parameters and Initial Values for Reaction-Diffusion
  Systems in Protein Networks (Extended Version)

  Spatio-temporal biochemical signaling in a large class of protein-protein
interaction networks is well modeled by a reaction-diffusion system. The global
existence of the solution to the reaction-diffusion system is determined by the
reaction kinetics model and the protein network topology. We propose a novel
reaction kinetics model that guarantees that the reaction-diffusion system with
this model has a nonnegative invariant global classical solution for any
network topology. We then present a computational method to identify the
unknown parameters and initial values for a reaction-diffusion system with this
reaction kinetics model. The identification approach solves an optimization
problem that minimizes the cost function defined as the $L^2$-norm of the
difference between the data and the solution of the reaction-diffusion system.
We utilize an adjoint-based optimal control method to obtain the gradients of
the cost function with respect to the parameters and initial values. The
regularity of the global classical solutions of the reaction-diffusion system
and its corresponding adjoint system avoids situations in which the gradients
blow up, and therefore guarantees the success of the identification method for
any network structure. Utilizing this gradient information, an efficient
algorithm to solve the optimization problem is proposed and applied to estimate
the mass diffusivities, rate constants and initial values of a
reaction-diffusion system that models protein-protein interactions in a
signaling network that regulates the actin cytoskeleton in a malignant breast
cell.


Risk-Limiting Dynamic Contracts for Direct Load Control

  This paper proposes a novel continuous-time dynamic contract framework that
has a risk-limiting capability. If a principal and an agent enter into such a
contract, the principal can optimally manage its performance and risk with a
guarantee that the agent's risk is less than or equal to a pre-specified level
and that the agent's expected payoff is greater than or equal to another
pre-specified threshold. We achieve such risk-management capabilities by
formulating the contract design problem as mean-variance constrained
risk-sensitive control. A dynamic programming-based method is developed to
solve the problem. The key idea of our proposed solution method is to
reformulate the inequality constraints on the mean and the variance of the
agent's payoff as dynamical system constraints by introducing new state and
control variables. The reformulations use the martingale representation
theorem. The proposed contract method enables us to develop a new direct load
control method that provides the load-serving entity with financial risk
management solutions in real-time electricity markets. We also propose an
approximate decomposition of the optimal contract design problem for multiple
customers into multiple low-dimensional contract problems for one customer.
This allows the direct load control program to work with a large number of
customers without any scalability issues. Furthermore, the contract design
procedure can be completely parallelized. The performance and usefulness of the
proposed contract method and its application to direct load control are
demonstrated using data on the electric energy consumption of customers in
Austin, Texas as well as the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas'
locational marginal price data.


Approximation Algorithms for Optimization of Combinatorial Dynamical
  Systems

  This paper considers an optimization problem for a dynamical system whose
evolution depends on a collection of binary decision variables. We develop
scalable approximation algorithms with provable suboptimality bounds to provide
computationally tractable solution methods even when the dimension of the
system and the number of the binary variables are large. The proposed method
employs a linear approximation of the objective function such that the
approximate problem is defined over the feasible space of the binary decision
variables, which is a discrete set. To define such a linear approximation, we
propose two different variation methods: one uses continuous relaxation of the
discrete space and the other uses convex combinations of the vector field and
running payoff. The approximate problem is a 0-1 linear program, which can be
solved by existing polynomial-time exact or approximation algorithms, and does
not require the solution of the dynamical system. Furthermore, we characterize
a sufficient condition ensuring the approximate solution has a provable
suboptimality bound. We show that this condition can be interpreted as the
concavity of the objective function. The performance and utility of the
proposed algorithms are demonstrated with the ON/OFF control problems of
interdependent refrigeration systems.


Safe Sequential Path Planning of Multi-Vehicle Systems via
  Double-Obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs Variational Inequality

  We consider the problem of planning trajectories for a group of $N$ vehicles,
each aiming to reach its own target set while avoiding danger zones of other
vehicles. The analysis of problems like this is extremely important
practically, especially given the growing interest in utilizing unmanned
aircraft systems for civil purposes. The direct solution of this problem by
solving a single-obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) variational inequality
(VI) is numerically intractable due to the exponential scaling of computation
complexity with problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the single-obstacle HJI VI
cannot directly handle situations in which vehicles do not have a common
scheduled arrival time. Instead, we perform sequential path planning by
considering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles as
time-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve a
double-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, defined
as the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while staying
within a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of the
double-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and the
optimal control for each vehicle. This is a first application of the
double-obstacle HJI VI which can handle systems with time-varying dynamics,
target sets, and state constraint sets, and results in computation complexity
that scales linearly, as opposed to exponentially, with the number of vehicles
in consideration.


Exact and Efficient Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability for Decoupled Systems

  Reachability analysis is important for studying optimal control problems and
differential games, which are powerful theoretical tools for analyzing and
modeling many practical problems in robotics, aircraft control, among other
application areas. In reachability analysis, one is interested in computing the
reachable set, defined as the set of states from which there exists a control,
despite the worst disturbance, that can drive the system into a set of target
states. The target states can be used to model either unsafe or desirable
configurations, depending on the application. Many Hamilton-Jacobi formulations
allow the computation of reachable sets; however, due to the exponential
complexity scaling in computation time and space, problems involving
approximately 5 dimensions become intractable. A number of methods that compute
an approximate solution exist in the literature, but these methods trade off
complexity for optimality. In this paper, we eliminate complexity-optimality
trade-offs for time-invariant decoupled systems using a decoupled
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation that enables the exact reconstruction of high
dimensional solutions via low dimensional solutions of the decoupled
subsystems. Our formulation is compatible with existing numerical tools, and we
show the accuracy, computation benefits, and an application of our novel
approach using two numerical examples.


Safe Platooning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles via Reachability

  Recently, there has been immense interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) for civilian operations such as package delivery, firefighting, and fast
disaster response. As a result, UAV traffic management systems are needed to
support potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the airspace, in
order to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met. Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) reachability is a powerful framework for providing conditions under which
these requirements can be met, and for synthesizing the optimal controller for
meeting them. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, HJ reachability is
only tractable for a small number of vehicles if their set of maneuvers is
unrestricted. In this paper, we define a platoon to be a group of UAVs in a
single-file formation. We model each vehicle as a hybrid system with modes
corresponding to its role in the platoon, and specify the set of allowed
maneuvers in each mode to make the analysis tractable. We propose several
liveness controllers based on HJ reachability, and wrap a safety controller,
also based on HJ reachability, around the liveness controllers. For a single
altitude range, our approach guarantees safety for one safety breach; in the
unlikely event of multiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed over
multiple altitude ranges. We demonstrate the satisfaction of liveness and
safety requirements through simulations of three common scenarios.


Multi-Vehicle Collision Avoidance via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability and
  Mixed Integer Programming

  Multi-agent differential games are important and useful tools for analyzing
many practical problems. With the recent surge of interest in using UAVs for
civil purposes, the importance and urgency of developing tractable multi-agent
analysis techniques that provide safety and performance guarantees is at an
all-time high. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability has successfully provided
safety guarantees to small-scale systems and is flexible in terms of system
dynamics. However, the exponential complexity scaling of HJ reachability
prevents its direct application to large scale problems when the number of
vehicles is greater than two. In this paper, we overcome the scalability
limitations of HJ reachability by using a mixed integer program that exploits
the properties of HJ solutions to provide higher-level control logic. Our
proposed method provides safety guarantee for three-vehicle systems -- a
previously intractable task for HJ reachability -- without incurring
significant additional computation cost. Furthermore, our method is scalable
beyond three vehicles and performs significantly better by several metrics than
an extension of pairwise collision avoidance to multi-vehicle collision
avoidance. We demonstrate our proposed method in simulations.


Fast Reachable Set Approximations via State Decoupling Disturbances

  With the recent surge of interest in using robotics and automation for civil
purposes, providing safety and performance guarantees has become extremely
important. In the past, differential games have been successfully used for the
analysis of safety-critical systems. In particular, the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
formulation of differential games provides a flexible way to compute the
reachable set, which can characterize the set of states which lead to either
desirable or undesirable configurations, depending on the application. While HJ
reachability is applicable to many small practical systems, the curse of
dimensionality prevents the direct application of HJ reachability to many
larger systems. To address computation complexity issues, various efficient
computation methods in the literature have been developed for approximating or
exactly computing the solution to HJ partial differential equations, but only
when the system dynamics are of specific forms. In this paper, we propose a
flexible method to trade off optimality with computation complexity in HJ
reachability analysis. To achieve this, we propose to simplify system dynamics
by treating state variables as disturbances. We prove that the resulting
approximation is conservative in the desired direction, and demonstrate our
method using a four-dimensional plane model.


Model Comparison of a Data-Driven and a Physical Model for Simulating
  HVAC Systems

  Commercial buildings are responsible for a large fraction of energy
consumption in developed countries, and therefore are targets of energy
efficiency programs. Motivated by the large inherent thermal inertia of
buildings, the power consumption can be flexibly scheduled without compromising
occupant comfort. This temporal flexibility offers opportunities for the
provision of frequency regulation to support grid stability. To realize energy
savings and frequency regulation, it is of prime importance to identify a
realistic model for the temperature dynamics of a building. We identify a low-
dimensional data-driven model and a high-dimensional physics- based model for
different spatial granularities and temporal seasons based on a case study of
an entire floor of Sutardja Dai Hall, an office building on the University of
California, Berkeley campus. A comparison of these contrasting models shows
that, despite the higher forecasting accuracy of the physics-based model, both
models perform almost equally well for energy efficient control. We conclude
that the data-driven model is more amenable to controller design due to its low
complexity, and could serve as a substitution for highly complex physics- based
models with an insignificant loss of prediction accuracy for many applications.
On the other hand, our physics-based approach is more suitable for modeling
buildings with finer spatial granularities.


Exact and Efficient Hamilton-Jacobi-based Guaranteed Safety Analysis via
  System Decomposition

  Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a method that provides rigorous analyses
of the safety properties of dynamical systems. This method has been
successfully applied to many low-dimensional dynamical system models such as
coarse models of aircraft and quadrotors in order to provide safety guarantees
in potentially dangerous scenarios. These guarantees can be provided by the
computation of a backward reachable set (BRS), which represents the set of
states from which the system may be driven into violating safety properties
despite the system's best effort to remain safe. Unfortunately, HJ reachability
is not practical for high-dimensional systems because the complexity of the BRS
computation scales exponentially with the number of state dimensions. Although
numerous approximation techniques are able to tractably provide conservative
estimates of the BRS, they often require restrictive assumptions about system
dynamics without providing an exact solution. In this paper we propose a
general method for decomposing dynamical systems. Even when the resulting
subsystems are coupled, relatively high-dimensional BRSs that were previously
intractable or expensive to compute can now be quickly and exactly computed in
lower-dimensional subspaces. As a result, the curse of dimensionality is
alleviated to a large degree without sacrificing optimality. We demonstrate our
theoretical results through two numerical examples: a 3D Dubins Car model and a
6D Acrobatic Quadrotor model.


Decomposition of Reachable Sets and Tubes for a Class of Nonlinear
  Systems

  Reachability analysis provides formal guarantees for performance and safety
properties of nonlinear control systems. Here, one aims to compute the backward
reachable set (BRS) or tube (BRT) -- the set of states from which the system
can be driven into a target set at a particular time or within a time interval,
respectively. The computational complexity of current approaches scales
exponentially, making application to high-dimensional systems intractable. We
propose a technique that decomposes the dynamics of a general class of
nonlinear systems into subsystems which may be coupled through common states,
controls, and disturbances. Despite this coupling, BRSs and BRTs can be
computed efficiently using our technique without incurring additional
approximation errors and without the need for linearizing dynamics or
approximating sets as polytopes. Computations of BRSs and BRTs now become
orders of magnitude faster, and for the first time BRSs and BRTs for many
high-dimensional nonlinear control systems can be computed using the
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) formulation. In situations involving bounded adversarial
disturbances, our proposed method can obtain slightly conservative results. We
demonstrate our theory by numerically computing BRSs and BRTs using the HJ
formulation for several systems, including the 6D Acrobatic Quadrotor and the
10D Near-Hover Quadrotor.


Robust Sequential Path Planning Under Disturbances and Adversarial
  Intruder

  Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle path planning is an important and
urgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspace
in the near future. Although this problem has been studied in the past, there
has not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for
vehicles with general nonlinear dynamics while taking into account disturbances
and potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and
safety under such scenarios, and has been successfully applied to many
small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most
cases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the
exponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system
dimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees HJ reachability
provides, and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority
ordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential path
planning (SPP) scheme, vehicles reserve "space-time" portions in the airspace,
and the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance,
and optimality of the paths given the priority ordering. With a computation
complexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and
an intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, SPP can
tractably solve the multi-vehicle path planning problem for vehicles with
general nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting. We demonstrate our theory in
representative simulations.


Eliciting Private User Information for Residential Demand Response

  Residential Demand Response has emerged as a viable tool to alleviate supply
and demand imbalances of electricity, particularly during times when the
electric grid is strained due a shortage of supply. Demand Response providers
bid reduction capacity into the wholesale electricity market by asking their
customers under contract to temporarily reduce their consumption in exchange
for a monetary incentive. To contribute to the analysis of consumer behavior in
response to such incentives, this paper formulates Demand Response as a
Mechanism Design problem, where a Demand Response Provider elicits private
information of its rational, profit-maximizing customers who derive positive
expected utility by participating in reduction events. By designing an
incentive compatible and individually rational mechanism to collect users'
price elasticities of demand, the Demand Response provider can target the most
susceptible users to incentives. We measure reductions by comparing the
materialized consumption to the projected consumption, which we model as the
"10-in-10"-baseline, the regulatory standard set by the California Independent
System Operator. Due to the suboptimal performance of this baseline, we show,
using consumption data of residential customers in California, that Demand
Response Providers receive payments for "virtual reductions", which exist due
to the inaccuracies of the baseline rather than actual reductions. Improving
the accuracy of the baseline diminishes the contribution of these virtual
reductions.


A General Safety Framework for Learning-Based Control in Uncertain
  Robotic Systems

  The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates
their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However,
guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an
unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We
propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability
methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The
method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee
constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process.
We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as
the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when
appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The
result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes
only when (a) the computed safety guarantees require it, or (b) confidence in
the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove
theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis
and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle.
Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the
quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient
reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a
strong external disturbance introduced during flight.


Provably Safe and Robust Drone Routing via Sequential Path Planning: A
  Case Study in San Francisco and the Bay Area

  Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle path planning is an important and
urgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspace
in the near future. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool for
analyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied to
several small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability
to large scale systems is often intractable because of its
exponentially-scaling computation complexity with respect to system dimension,
also known as the "curse of dimensionality". To overcome this problem, the
sequential path planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to
vehicles, was previously proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be
done with a linearly-scaling computation complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate the potential of SPP algorithm for large-scale systems. In
particular, we simulate large-scale multi-vehicle systems in two different
urban environments, a city environment and a multi-city environment, and use
the SPP algorithm for trajectory planning. SPP is able to efficiently design
collision-free trajectories in both environments despite the presence of
disturbances in vehicles' dynamics. To ensure a safe transition of vehicles to
their destinations, our method automatically allocates space-time reservations
to vehicles while accounting for the magnitude of disturbances such as wind in
a provably safe way. Our simulation results show an intuitive multi-lane
structure in airspace, where the number of lanes and the distance between the
lanes depend on the size of disturbances and other problem parameters.


Safe and Resilient Multi-vehicle Trajectory Planning Under Adversarial
  Intruder

  Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle trajectory planning is an important
and urgent problem. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool for
analyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied to
several small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability
to multi-vehicle trajectory planning is often intractable due to the "curse of
dimensionality." To overcome this problem, the sequential trajectory planning
(STP) method, which assigns strict priorities to vehicles, was proposed, STP
allows multi-vehicle trajectory planning to be done with a linearly-scaling
computation complexity. However, if a vehicle not in the set of STP vehicles
enters the system, or even worse, if this vehicle is an adversarial intruder,
the previous formulation requires the entire system to perform replanning, an
intractable task for large-scale systems. In this paper, we make STP more
practical by providing a new algorithm where replanning is only needed only for
a fixed number of vehicles, irrespective of the total number of STP vehicles.
Moreover, this number is a design parameter, which can be chosen based on the
computational resources available during run time. We demonstrate this
algorithm in a representative simulation of an urban airspace environment.


Robust Tracking with Model Mismatch for Fast and Safe Planning: an SOS
  Optimization Approach

  In the pursuit of real-time motion planning, a commonly adopted practice is
to compute a trajectory by running a planning algorithm on a simplified,
low-dimensional dynamical model, and then employ a feedback tracking controller
that tracks such a trajectory by accounting for the full, high-dimensional
system dynamics. While this strategy of planning with model mismatch generally
yields fast computation times, there are no guarantees of dynamic feasibility,
which hampers application to safety-critical systems. Building upon recent work
that addressed this problem through the lens of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
reachability, we devise an algorithmic framework whereby one computes, offline,
for a pair of "planner" (i.e., low-dimensional) and "tracking" (i.e.,
high-dimensional) models, a feedback tracking controller and associated
tracking bound. This bound is then used as a safety margin when generating
motion plans via the low-dimensional model. Specifically, we harness the
computational tool of sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to design a bilinear
optimization algorithm for the computation of the feedback tracking controller
and associated tracking bound. The algorithm is demonstrated via numerical
experiments, with an emphasis on investigating the trade-off between the
increased computational scalability afforded by SOS and its intrinsic
conservativeness. Collectively, our results enable scaling the appealing
strategy of planning with model mismatch to systems that are beyond the reach
of HJ analysis, while maintaining safety guarantees.


A New Simulation Metric to Determine Safe Environments and Controllers
  for Systems with Unknown Dynamics

  We consider the problem of extracting safe environments and controllers for
reach-avoid objectives for systems with known state and control spaces, but
unknown dynamics. In a given environment, a common approach is to synthesize a
controller from an abstraction or a model of the system (potentially learned
from data). However, in many situations, the relationship between the dynamics
of the model and the \textit{actual system} is not known; and hence it is
difficult to provide safety guarantees for the system. In such cases, the
Standard Simulation Metric (SSM), defined as the worst-case norm distance
between the model and the system output trajectories, can be used to modify a
reach-avoid specification for the system into a more stringent specification
for the abstraction. Nevertheless, the obtained distance, and hence the
modified specification, can be quite conservative. This limits the set of
environments for which a safe controller can be obtained. We propose SPEC, a
specification-centric simulation metric, which overcomes these limitations by
computing the distance using only the trajectories that violate the
specification for the system. We show that modifying a reach-avoid
specification with SPEC allows us to synthesize a safe controller for a larger
set of environments compared to SSM. We also propose a probabilistic method to
compute SPEC for a general class of systems. Case studies using simulators for
quadrotors and autonomous cars illustrate the advantages of the proposed metric
for determining safe environment sets and controllers.


A Risk-Sensitive Finite-Time Reachability Approach for Safety of
  Stochastic Dynamic Systems

  A classic reachability problem for safety of dynamic systems is to compute
the set of initial states from which the state trajectory is guaranteed to stay
inside a given constraint set over a given time horizon. In this paper, we
leverage existing theory of reachability analysis and risk measures to devise a
risk-sensitive reachability approach for safety of stochastic dynamic systems
under non-adversarial disturbances over a finite time horizon. Specifically, we
first introduce the notion of a risk-sensitive safe set as a set of initial
states from which the risk of large constraint violations can be reduced to a
required level via a control policy, where risk is quantified using the
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure. Second, we show how the computation
of a risk-sensitive safe set can be reduced to the solution to a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), where cost is assessed according to CVaR. Third,
leveraging this reduction, we devise a tractable algorithm to approximate a
risk-sensitive safe set, and provide theoretical arguments about its
correctness. Finally, we present a realistic example inspired from stormwater
catchment design to demonstrate the utility of risk-sensitive reachability
analysis. In particular, our approach allows a practitioner to tune the level
of risk sensitivity from worst-case (which is typical for Hamilton-Jacobi
reachability analysis) to risk-neutral (which is the case for stochastic
reachability analysis).


Reachability-Based Safety Guarantees using Efficient Initializations

  Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for
analyzing the safety of autonomous systems. This analysis is computationally
intensive and typically performed offline. Online, however, the autonomous
system may experience changes in system dynamics, external disturbances, and/or
the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety guarantees. Rather than
restarting the safety analysis, we propose a method of "warm-start"
reachability, which uses a user-defined initialization (typically the
previously computed solution). By starting with an HJI function that is closer
to the solution than the standard initialization, convergence may take fewer
iterations.
  In this paper we prove that warm-starting will result in guaranteed
conservative solutions by over-approximating the states that must be avoided to
maintain safety. We additionally prove that for many common problem
formulations, warm-starting will result in exact solutions.We demonstrate our
method on several illustrative examples with a double integrator, and also on a
more practical example with a 10D quadcopter model that experiences changes in
mass and disturbances and must update its safety guarantees accordingly. We
compare our approach to standard reachability and a recently proposed
"discounted" reachability method, and find for our examples that warm-starting
is 1.6 times faster than standard and 6.2 times faster than (untuned)
discounted reachability.
