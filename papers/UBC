Generalized London free energy for high-$T_c$ vortex lattices

  We generalize the London free energy to include four-fold anisotropies whichcould arise from d-wave pairing or other sources in a tetragonal material. Weuse this simple model to study vortex lattice structure and discuss neutronscattering, STM, Bitter decoration and $\mu$SR experiments.

White Dwarfs in Globular Clusters: HST Observations of M4

  Using WFPC2 on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have isolated a sample of 258white dwarfs (WDs) in the Galactic globular cluster M4. Fields at three radialdistances from the cluster center were observed and sizeable WD populationswere found in all three. The location of these WDs in the color-magnitudediagram, their mean mass of 0.51($ \pm 0.03$)M$_{\odot}$, and their luminosityfunction confirm basic tenets of stellar evolution theory and support theresults from current WD cooling theory. The WDs are used to extend the clustermain-sequence mass function upward to stars that have already completed theirnuclear evolution. The WD/red dwarf binary frequency in M4 is investigated andfound to be at most a few percent of all the main-sequence stars. The mostancient WDs found are about 9 Gyr old, a level which is set solely by thephotometric limits of our data. Even though this is less than the age of M4, wediscuss how these cooling WDs can eventually be used to check the turnoff agesof globular clusters and hence constrain the age of the Universe.

Theory of the field-induced gap in $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic chains

  In a recent neutron-scattering experiment on the quasi-one-dimensional$S=1/2$ antiferromagnet Cu Benzoate, a gap was induced by an applied magneticfield. We argue that the primary mechanism of the gap formation is an effectivestaggered field due to both the alternating $g$-tensor and theDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We explain the dependence of the gap on theapplied field, as well as identify several peaks in the structure factor$S(q,\omega)$.

Solving the Conformal Bootstrap: Four-Fermion Interactions at 2<d<4

  We formulate the conformal bootstrap approach to four--fermion theory at itsstrong coupling fixed point in dimensions $2<d<4$. We present a solution of thebootstrap equations in the five--vertex approximation. We show that thebootstrap approach gives a particularly simple way to obtain next to leadingorder corrections to critical exponents in the large $N$ expansion and presentthe values of the anomalous dimensions of the fermion field $\psi$ and thecomposite $\bar\psi\psi$ to order $1/N^2$.

Defect Lines in the Ising Model and Boundary States on Orbifolds

  Critical phenomena in the two-dimensional Ising model with a defect line arestudied using boundary conformal field theory on the $c=1$ orbifold. Novelfeatures of the boundary states arising from the orbifold structure, includingcontinuously varying boundary critical exponents, are elucidated. New featuresof the Ising defect problem are obtained including a novel universality classof defect lines and the universal boundary to bulk crossover of the spincorrelation function.

  This is a nontechnical Perspective Commentary on the recent developments incuprate STM and their ramifications for the theories of the pseudogap state,focusing on the paper by Hanaguri et al. [Nature 430, 1001 (2004)].

HepToX: Heterogeneous Peer to Peer XML Databases

  We study a collection of heterogeneous XML databases maintaining similar andrelated information, exchanging data via a peer to peer overlay network. Inthis setting, a mediated global schema is unrealistic. Yet, users/applicationswish to query the databases via one peer using its schema. We have recentlydeveloped HepToX, a P2P Heterogeneous XML database system. A key idea is thatwhenever a peer enters the system, it establishes an acquaintance with a smallnumber of peer databases, possibly with different schema. The peeradministrator provides correspondences between the local schema and theacquaintance schema using an informal and intuitive notation of arrows andboxes. We develop a novel algorithm that infers a set of precise mapping rulesbetween the schemas from these visual annotations. We pin down a semantics ofquery translation given such mapping rules, and present a novel querytranslation algorithm for a simple but expressive fragment of XQuery, thatemploys the mapping rules in either direction. We show the translationalgorithm is correct. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and scalability ofour ideas and algorithms with a detailed set of experiments on top of theEmulab, a large scale P2P network emulation testbed.

A short simplicial h-vector and the upper bound theorem

  We verify the Upper Bound Conjecture (UBC) for a class of odd-dimensionalsimplicial complexes that in particular includes all Eulerian simplicialcomplexes with isolated singularities. The proof relies on a new invariant ofsimplicial complexes -- a short simplicial h-vector.

On the Radial Distribution of White Dwarfs in the Globular Cluster NGC  6397

  We have examined the radial distribution of white dwarfs over a singleHST/ACS field in the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. In relaxed populations,such as in a globular cluster, stellar velocity dispersion, and hence radialdistribution, is directly dependent on stellar masses. The progenitors of veryyoung cluster white dwarfs had a mass of ~0.8 solar masses, while the whitedwarfs themselves have a mass of ~0.5 solar masses. We thus expect young whitedwarfs to have a concentrated radial distribution (like that of theirprogenitors) that becomes more extended over several relaxation times to mimicthat of ~0.5 solar mass main-sequence stars. However, we observe young whitedwarfs to have a significantly extended radial distribution compared to boththe most massive main sequence stars in the cluster and also to old whitedwarfs.

Vortices, zero modes and fractionalization in bilayer-graphene exciton  condensate

  A real-space formulation is given for the recently discussed excitoncondensate in a symmetrically biased graphene bilayer. We show that in thecontinuum limit an oddly-quantized vortex in this condensate binds exactly onezero mode per valley index of the bilayer. In the full lattice model the zeromodes are split slightly due to intervalley mixing. We support these results byan exact numerical diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian. We also discussthe effect of the zero modes on the charge content of these vortices and deducesome of their interesting properties.

The SCUBA HAlf Degree Extragalactic Survey (SHADES) -- VI. 350 micron  mapping of submillimetre galaxies

  A follow-up survey using the Submillimetre High-Angular Resolution Camera(SHARC-II) at 350 microns has been carried out to map the regions aroundseveral 850 micron-selected sources from the Submillimetre HAlf DegreeExtragalactic Survey (SHADES). These observations probe the infraredluminosities and hence star-formation rates in the largest existing, mostrobust sample of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs). We measure 350 micron fluxdensities for 24 850 micron sources, seven of which are detected at >2.5-sigmawithin a 10 arcsec search radius of the 850 micron positions. When results fromthe literature are included the total number of 350 micron flux densityconstraints of SHADES SMGs is 31, with 15 detections. We fit a modifiedblackbody to the far-infrared (FIR) photometry of each SMG, and confirm thattypical SMGs are dust-rich (Mdust~9x10^8 Msun), luminous (Lfir~2x10^12 Lsun),star-forming galaxies with intrinsic dust temperatures of ~35 K andstar-formation rates of ~400 Msun/yr. We have measured the temperaturedistribution of SMGs and find that the underlying distribution is slightlybroader than implied by the error bars, and that most SMGs are at 28 K with afew hotter. We also place new constraints on the 350 micron source counts,N350(>25mJy)~200-500 deg^-2.

Age Gradient and the Second Parameter Problem in the Galactic Halo

  We establish a framework for determing absolute ages of Galactic globularclusters and then use these ages to investigate the age-metallicity andage-Galactocentric distance relations for the 36 clusters with the mostreliable age data. The clusters span Galactocentric distances from 4 through100 kpc and cover a metallicity range from $[Fe/H] = -0.6$ to $-2.3$. Adoptingcurrently plausible choices for the relation between cluster metallicity andhorizontal-branch luminosity, and alpha-enhancement ratios, we find that themajority of the globular clusters form an age distribution with a dispersion$\sigma(t)$ about $10^9$ years, and a total age spread smaller than 4 Gyr.Clusters in the lowest metallicity group ($[Fe/H] < -1.8$) appear to be thesame age to well within 1 Gyr at all locations in the Milky Way halo,suggesting that star formation began throughout the halo nearly simultaneouslyin its earliest stages. We find no statistically significant correlationbetween mean cluster age and Galactocentric distance (no age gradient) from 4to 100 kpc. The correlation between cluster age and horizontal-branch typesuggests that causes in addition to metallicity and age are required tounderstand the distribution of stars along the horizontal branches in globularcluster color-magnitude diagrams.

HST Observations of the White Dwarf Cooling Sequence of M4

  We investigate in detail the white dwarf cooling sequence of the globularcluster Messier 4. In particular we study the influence of various systematicuncertainties, both observational and theoretical, on the determination of thecluster age from the white dwarf cooling sequence. These include uncertaintiesin the distance to the cluster and the extinction along the line of sight, aswell as the white dwarf mass, envelope and core compositions and the whitedwarf --main sequence mass relation. We find that fitting to the fulltwo-dimensional colour-magnitude diagram offers a more robust method for agedetermination than the traditional method of fitting the one-dimensional whitedwarf luminosity function.  After taking into account the various uncertainties, we find a best fit ageof 12.1 Gyr, with a 95% lower limit of 10.3 Gyr. We also perform fits using twoother sets of cooling models from the literature. The models of Chabrier et al(2000) yield an encouragingly similar result, although the models of Salaris etal (2000) do not provide as good a fit. Our results support our previousdetermination of a delay between the formation of the Galactic halo and theonset of star formation in the Galactic disk.

Concerning the White Dwarf Cooling Age of M4: A Response to the Paper by  De Marchi et al. on "A Different Interpretation of Recent HST Observations"

  We respond to the paper by De Marchi, Paresce, Straniero and Moroni (2003) onthe white dwarf cooling age of M4. The authors question the data analysis andinterpretation that led to the conclusions in Hansen et al. (2002). In theirpaper, De Marchi et al. are unable to obtain photometry as deep as ours fromthe same data set and therefore assert that only a lower limit to the whitedwarf cooling age for this cluster of approximately 9 Gyr can be obtained.  In this short contribution we show that shortcomings in the data analysis andreduction techniques of De Marchi et al. are responsible for their inability toreach the photometry limits that our study reports. In a forthcoming paper inwhich the complete techniques for age determination with white dwarfs are laidout, we demonstrate that their method of fitting the luminosity function givesa spuriously low white dwarf cooling age.

Creation and manipulation of anyons in a layered superconductor-2DEG  system

  We describe and analyze in detail our recent theoretical proposal for therealization and manipulation of anyons in a weakly interacting systemconsisting of a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regimeadjacent to a type-II superconducting film with an artificial array of pinningsites. The anyon is realized in response to a defect in the pinned vortexlattice and carries a charge \pm e/2 and a statistical angle pi/4. We establishthis result, both analytically and numerically, in three complementaryapproaches: (i) a continuum model of two-dimensional electrons in the vortexlattice of the superconducting film; (ii) a minimal tight-binding lattice modelthat captures the essential features of the system; and (iii) an effectivetheory of the superconducting vortex lattice superposed on the integer quantumHall state. We propose a novel method to measure the fractional charge directlyin a bulk transport experiment and an all-electric setup for an ``anyonshuttle'' implementing the braiding operations. We briefly discuss conditionsfor fabricating the system in the lab and its potential applications in quantuminformation processing with non-Abelian anyons.

Comparing the White Dwarf Cooling Sequences in 47 Tuc and NGC 6397

  Using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging, color-magnitude diagrams areconstructed for the globular clusters 47 Tuc and NGC 6397. As expected, becauseof its lower metal abundance, the main sequence of NGC 6397 lies well to theblue of that of 47 Tuc. A comparison of the white dwarf cooling sequences ofthe two clusters, however, demonstrates that these sequences areindistinguishable over most of their loci - a consequence of the settling outof heavy elements in the dense white dwarf atmosphere and the near equality oftheir masses. Lower quality data on M4 continues this trend to a third clusterwhose metallicity is intermediate between these two. While the path of thewhite dwarfs in the color-magnitude diagram is nearly identical in 47 Tuc andNGC 6397, the numbers of white dwarfs along the path are not. This results fromthe relatively rapid relaxation in NGC 6397 compared to 47 Tuc and provides acautionary note that simply counting objects in star clusters in randomlocations as a method of testing stellar evolutionary theory is likelydangerous unless dynamical considerations are included.

Future Cosmic Microwave Background Experiments

  We summarise some aspects of experiments currently being built or planned,and indulge in wild speculation about possibilities on the more distanthorizon.

The Massive Binary Pulsar J1740-3052

  The young pulsar J1740-3052 is in an 8-month orbit with a companion of atleast 11 solar masses. We present multifrequency GBT and Parkes timingobservations, and discuss implications for the nature of the companion.

High-Resolution Observations of PSR B1828-11

  We present high-time-resolution observations of the young precessing pulsarB1828-11, which yield clues to the true beam shape and the fundamentalprecession period.

HST Observations of the Main Sequence of M4

  This paper presents new results from a photometric study of the main-sequencestars in M4, the closest globular cluster to the sun. Multi-field, multi-epochobservations at approximately 1, 2, and 6 core-radii were obtained with theWFPC2 camera on the HST. The multi-epoch observations allowed us to clean thedata on the basis of proper motion. In all the fields the cluster main sequencecan be traced to at least V = 27.0 but there remains a trail of stars to thelimit of the data near V = 30 in the deepest outer field. There is no evidencethat we have reached the end of the hydrogen burning main sequence in any ofour fields, however, there is some indication that very few stars remain to bedetected in the deepest data.  The scatter about the cluster main sequence yields a surprisingly small andvariable binary fraction; f_b = 2% in the inner parts of the cluster falling tothe 1% range outside. For the currently visible main sequence stars, thecluster mass function is very flat (alpha =0.1) in the outer field and flattensfurther in the inner fields suggesting well developed mass segregation. Theobserved variation in the mass function is broadly consistent with isotropic,multi-mass Michie-King models. Because we have a large sample of white dwarfsin the outer field we are able to show that the cluster IMF above 0.8Msun wasconsiderably steeper than the present day mass function for low mass stars.  Two appendicies are included in this contribution; a detailed discussion ofthe techniques used to reduce the data and a direct comparison between thecluster stars and those belonging to the inner spheroid of the Galaxy yieldinga Galactocentric distance of 7.5+/-0.6 kpc.

Arecibo Measurements of Pulsar--White Dwarf Binaries: Evidence for Heavy  Neutron Stars

  We summarize constraints on neutron star masses from ongoing timingobservations of pulsar-white dwarf binaries at Arecibo. The trend is towardpulsar masses larger than the canonical value of 1.35 solar masses.

On the Observability of Meso- and Macro-scopic Quantum Coherence of  Domain Walls in Magnetic Insulators

  Results are presented of a numerical calculation of the tunneling gap for adomain wall moving in the double well potential of a pair of voids in amagnetic insulator. Both symmetric and asymmetric double well potentials areconsidered. It is found that, even in the absence of dissipation, the prospectsfor observing quantum coherence on a meso- or macro-scopic scale appearsunlikely.

Is there an exponentially large Kondo screening cloud ?

  We make a precise scaling conjecture, based on renormalization group ideas,regarding the screening cloud around an impurity spin in the Kondo effect andtest it numerically using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method.

Exact Correlation Amplitude for the S=1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic  Chain

  The exact amplitude for the asymptotic correlation function in the S=1/2Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain is determined: <S^a_0 S^b_r> goes to (-1)^rdelta^{ab}(ln r)^{1/2}/[(2 pi)^{3/2}r]. The behaviour of the correlationfunctions for small xxz anisotropy and the form of finite-size corrections tothe correlation function are also analysed.

Gauge invariant fermion propagator in QED3

  In a recent preprint [cond-mat/0204040] Khveshchenko questioned the validityof our computation of the gauge invariant fermion propagator in QED3, which weemployed as an effective theory of high-T_c cuprate superconductors[cond-mat/0203333]. We take this opportunity to further clarify our procedureand to show that criticism voiced in the above preprint is unwarranted.

Cyclic Lattice Feshbach Resonances

  In this Letter we illustrate the possible cyclic fermion pairing statesacross Feshbach resonances in optical lattices. In cyclic fermion pairing, thepairing amplitude exhibits an oscillatory behavior as the detuning varies. Weestimate the quasi-particle gaps in different regimes of the resonances.

$2d$ gravity and matrix models. I. $2d$ gravity

  Some approaches to $2d$ gravity developed for the last years are reviewed.They are physical (Liouville) gravity, topological theories and matrix models.A special attention is paid to matrix models and their interrelations withdifferent approaches. Almost all technical details are omitted, but examplesare presented.

Exchange symmetry and global entanglement and full separability

  Ichikawa et al. [Phys. Rev. A 78, 052105 (2008)] showed that exchangesymmetry gives rise to simple characterization of whether multipartite purequantum states being either globally entangled or fully separable. In thisBrief Report, we provide a simple alternative approach and some extension totheir conclusions.

Recent CMS Results on Forward and Small-x QCD Physics

  Recent CMS results on Forward and Small-x QCD Physics are presented. Thoseinclude the measurement of the Underlying Event activity and the study of jetproduction at large rapidity separation.

Ubc/Laval 2.7-Meter Liquid Mirror Telescope

  We report the successful development and operation of a large astronomicalliquid-mirror telescope. Employing a rotating 2.7-meter diameter mirror with asurface of liquid mercury, the telescope images a half-degree diameter fieldcentered at the zenith. Located near Vancouver, British Columbia, it isequipped with a low-noise 2048x2048-pixel CCD detector, operating in TDI mode,which produces continuous imaging of a 20 arcminute-widestrip of sky with 2minute integration time. Images with FWHM of 2 arcseconds or less are regularlyobtained. This image quality is limited only by atmospheric seeing andstar-trail curvature. The telescope is equipped with a series of narrow-bandfilters, designed to produce 40-point spectral energy distributions from 0.4 to1.0 microns of all detected objects. These will allow classification andredshift estimation of approximately 25,000 galaxies and 1,000 quasars to alimiting magnitude of R~21.

First results from the UBC etch-alignment mosaic CCD

  First imaging results are obtained with a new CCD mosaic prototype (3K x 3k,15 \mu m pixels). The CCDs are aligned using an etched socket alignmenttechnique. Three different measurements of the alignment are made using starimages, test p attern images, and microscope analysis. The CCDs have an angularmisalignement o f less than 30 ppm. The composite device is flat to within \pm3 \mu m, with rows/columns oriented to within 20 ppm. The use of an existingtechnology with built in precision reduces many of the difficulties andexpenses typically encountered with mosaic detector construction. A new camerabeing built for the UBC liquid mirror telescope is al so described.

Topological Statistics and the LMT Galaxy Redshift Survey

  The results of numerical simulations are presented which demonstrate thatliquid mirror telescope galaxy redshift surveys such as the current UBC-NASAMulti-Narrowband Survey and the future LZT Survey have the potential ofdiscriminating between the predictions of different theories of structureformation. Most of the currently studied theories of structure formationpredict a scale-invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations. Therefore, todistinguish between the predictions of the various models, we make use ofstatistics which are sensitive to non-Gaussian phases, such as the counts incell statistics, N-galaxy probability functions and Minkowski functionals. Itis shown that already the current UBC-NASA survey can clearly differentiatebetween the predictions of some topological defect theories and those ofinflationary Universe models with Gaussian phases.

Isochrones and Luminosity Functions for Old White Dwarfs

  Using a new grid of models of cooling white dwarfs, we calculate isochronesand luminosity functions in the Johnson-Kron/Cousins and HST filter sets forsystems containing old white dwarfs. These new models incorporate a non-greyatmosphere which is necessary to properly describe the effects of molecularopacity at the cool temperatures of old white dwarfs. The various functionscalculated and extensively tabulated and plotted are meant to be as utilitarianas possible for observers so all results are listed in quantities thatobservers will obtain. The tables and plots developed should eventually provecritical in interpreting the results of HST's Advanced Camera observations ofthe oldest white dwarfs in nearby globular clusters, in understanding theresults of searches for old white dwarfs in the Galactic halo, and indetermining ages for star clusters of all ages using white dwarfs. As apractical application we demonstrate the use of these results by deriving thewhite dwarf cooling age of the old Galactic cluster M67.

The White Dwarf Cooling Sequence of the Globular Cluster Messier 4

  We present the white dwarf sequence of the globular cluster M4, based on a123 orbit Hubble Space Telescope exposure, with limiting magnitude V = 30, I =28. The white dwarf luminosity function rises sharply for I >25.5, consistentwith the behaviour expected for a burst population. The white dwarfs of M4extend to approximately 2.5 magnitudes fainter than the peak of the localGalactic disk white dwarf luminosity function. This demonstrates a clear andsignificant age difference between the Galactic disk and the halo globularcluster M4. Using the same standard white dwarf models (Hansen 1999) to fiteach luminosity function yields ages of 7.3 +/- 1.5 Gyr for the disk and 12.7+/- 0.7 Gyr for M4 (2-sigma statistical errors).

Boundary conformal field theory approach to the two-dimensional critical  Ising model with a defect line

  We study the critical two-dimensional Ising model with a defect line (alteredbond strength along a line) in the continuum limit. By folding the system atthe defect line, the problem is mapped to a special case of the criticalAshkin-Teller model, the continuum limit of which is the $Z_2$ orbifold of thefree boson, with a boundary. Possible boundary states on the $Z_2$ orbifoldtheory are explored, and a special case is applied to the Ising defect problem.We find the complete spectrum of boundary operators, exact two-pointcorrelation functions and the universal term in the free energy of the defectline for arbitrary strength of the defect. We also find a new universalityclass of defect lines. It is conjectured that we have found all the possibleuniversality classes of defect lines in the Ising model. Relative stabilitiesamong the defect universality classes are discussed.

Spin Gap in a Doped Kondo Chain

  We show that the Kondo chain away from half-filling has a spin gap upon theintroduction of an additional direct Heisenberg coupling between localizedspins. This is understood in the weak-Kondo-coupling limit of theHeisenberg-Kondo lattice model by bosonization and in the strong-coupling limitby a mapping to a modified t-J model. Only for certain ranges of filling andHeisenberg coupling does the spin gap phase extend from weak to strongcoupling.

Magnetically Stabilized Nematic Order I: Three-Dimensional Bipartite  Optical Lattices

  We study magnetically stabilized nematic order for spin-one bosons in opticallattices. We show that the Zeeman field-driven quantum transitions betweennon-nematic Mott states and quantum spin nematic states in the weak hoppinglimit are in the universality class of the ferromagnetic XXZ (S=1/2) spinmodel. We further discuss these transitions as condensation of interactingmagnons. The development of O(2) nematic order when external fields are appliedcorresponds to condensation of magnons, which breaks a U(1) symmetry.Microscopically, this results from a coherent superposition of two non-nematicstates at each individual site. Nematic order and spin wave excitations aroundcritical points are studied and critical behaviors are obtained in a dilute gasapproximation. We also find that spin singlet states are unstable with respectto quadratic Zeeman effects and Ising nematic order appears in the presence ofany finite quadratic Zeeman coupling. All discussions are carried out forstates in three dimensional bipartite lattices.

Knot polynomials and generalized mutation

  The motivation for this work was to construct a nontrivial knot with trivialJones polynomial. Although that open problem has not yielded, the methods areuseful for other problems in the theory of knot polynomials. The subject of thepresent paper is a generalization of Conway's mutation of knots and links.Instead of flipping a 2-strand tangle, one flips a many-string tangle toproduce a generalized mutant. In the presence of rotational symmetry in thattangle, the result is called a "rotant". We show that if a rotant issufficiently simple, then its Jones polynomial agrees with that of the originallink. As an application, this provides a method of generating many examples oflinks with the same Jones polynomial, but different Alexander polynomials.Various other knot polynomials, as well as signature, are also invariant undersuch moves, if one imposes more stringent conditions upon the symmetries.Applications are also given to polynomials of satellites and symmetric knots.

Pseudospectral methods for atoms in strong magnetic fields

  We present a new pseudospectral algorithm for the calculation of thestructure of atoms in strong magnetic fields. We have verified this techniquefor one, two and three-electron atoms in zero magnetic fields againstlaboratory results and find typically better than one-percent accuracy. Wefurther verify this technique against the state-of-the-art calculations ofhydrogen, helium and lithium in strong magnetic fields (up to about $2\times10^{6}$ T) and find a similar level of agreement. The key enabling advantagesof the algorithm are its simplicity (about 130 lines of commented code) and itsspeed (about $10^2-10^5$ times faster than finite-element methods to achievesimilar accuracy).

Protohalo Constraints to the Resonant Annihilation of Dark Matter

  It has recently been argued that the PAMELA, ATIC and PPB-BETS data showingan anomalous excess of high-energy cosmic ray positrons and electrons might beexplained by dark matter annihilating in the Galactic halo with a cross sectionresonantly enhanced compared to its value in the primeval plasma. We find thatwith a very large annihilation cross section the flash of energetic photons andelectron-positron pairs expected from dark-matter annihilation in the firstprotohalos that form at redshift z~40 is likely substantial and observable. Asa consequence, bounds on the allowed energy injection into the primordial gasand the energy density of the diffuse gamma-ray background give rise to limitson the low-velocity dark matter cross section that can be difficult toreconcile with this interpretation of the PAMELA, ATIC and PPB-BETS results.

Tunable Luttinger liquid physics in biased bilayer graphene

  Electronically gated bilayer graphene behaves as a tunable gap semiconductorunder a uniform interlayer bias $V_{g}$. Imposing a spatially varying bias,which changes polarity from $-V_g$ to $+V_g$, leads to one dimensional (1D)chiral modes localized along the domain wall of the bias. Due to the broadtransverse spread of their low-energy wavefunctions, we find that the dominantinteraction between these 1D electrons is the forward scattering part of theCoulomb repulsion. Incorporating these interactions and the gate voltagedependence of the dispersion and wavefunctions, we find that these 1D modesbehave as a strongly interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with three distinctmode velocities and a bias dependent Luttinger parameter, and discuss itsexperimental signatures.

Multi-State Dark Matter from Spherical Extra Dimensions

  We demonstrate a new model which uses an ADD type braneworld scenario toproduce a multi-state theory of dark matter. Compactification of the extradimensions onto a sphere leads to the association of a single complex scalar inthe bulk with multiple Kaluza-Klein towers in an effective four-dimensionaltheory. A mutually interacting multi-state theory of dark matter arisesnaturally within which the dark matter states are identified with the lightestKaluza-Klein particles of fixed magnetic quantum number. These states areprotected from decay by a combination of a global U(1) symmetry and thecontinuous rotational symmetry about the polar axis of the spherical geometry.We briefly discuss the relic abundance calculation and investigate thespin-independent elastic scattering off nucleons of the lightest andnext-to-lightest dark matter states.

On quantifying and resolving the BICEP2/Planck tension over  gravitational waves

  The recent BICEP2 measurement of primordial gravity waves (r =0.2^{+0.07}_{-0.05}) appears to be in tension with the upper limit from WMAP(r<0.13 at 95% CL) and Planck (r<0.11 at 95% CL). We carefully quantify thelevel of tension and show that it is very significant (around 0.1% unlikely)when the observed deficit of large-scale temperature power is taken intoaccount. We show that measurements of TE and EE power spectra in the nearfuture will discriminate between the hypotheses that this tension is either astatistical fluke, or a sign of new physics. We also discuss extensions of thestandard cosmological model that relieve the tension, and some novel ways toconstrain them.

The Effects of Rayleigh Scattering on the CMB and Cosmic Structure

  During and after recombination, in addition to Thomson scattering with freeelectrons, photons also coupled to neutral hydrogen and helium atoms throughRayleigh scattering. This coupling influences both CMB anisotropies and thedistribution of matter in the Universe. The frequency-dependence of theRayleigh cross section breaks the thermal nature of CMB temperature andpolarization anisotropies and effectively doubles the number of variablesneeded to describe CMB intensity and polarization statistics, while theadditional atomic coupling changes the matter distribution and the lensing ofthe CMB. We introduce a new method to capture the effects of Rayleighscattering on cosmological power spectra. Rayleigh scattering modifies CMBtemperature and polarization anisotropies at the $\sim\!1 \%$ level at $353{\rm GHz}$ (scaling $\propto \nu^4$), and modifies matter correlations by asmuch as $\sim\!0.3\%$. We show the Rayleigh signal, especially thecross-spectra between the thermal (Rayleigh) E-polarization and Rayleigh(thermal) intensity signal, may be detectable with future CMB missions even inthe presence of foregrounds, and how this new information might help to betterconstrain the cosmological parameters.

The SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey: blank-field number counts of  450um-selected galaxies and their contribution to the cosmic infrared  background

  The first deep blank-field 450um map (1-sigma~1.3mJy) from the SCUBA-2Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS), conducted with the James Clerk MaxwellTelescope (JCMT) is presented. Our map covers 140 arcmin^2 of the COSMOS field,in the footprint of the HST CANDELS area. Using 60 submillimetre galaxies(SMGs) detected at >3.75-sigma, we evaluate the number counts of 450um-selectedgalaxies with flux densities S_450>5mJy. The 8-arcsec JCMT beam and highsensitivity of SCUBA-2 now make it possible to directly resolve a largerfraction of the cosmic infrared background (CIB, peaking at ~200um) into theindividual galaxies responsible for its emission than has previously beenpossible at this wavelength. At S_450>5mJy we resolve (7.4[+/-]0.7)x10^-2MJy/sr of the CIB at 450um (equivalent to 16[+/-]7% of the absolute brightnessmeasured by COBE at this wavelength) into point sources. A further ~40% of theCIB can be recovered through a statistical stack of 24um emitters in thisfield, indicating that the majority (~60%) of the CIB at 450um is emitted bygalaxies with S_450>2mJy. The average redshift of 450um emitters identifiedwith an optical/near-infrared counterpart is estimated to be <z>=1.3, implyingthat the galaxies in the sample are in the ultraluminous class (L_IR~1.1x10^12L_sun). If the galaxies contributing to the statistical stack lie at similarredshifts, then the majority of the CIB at 450um is emitted by galaxies in theLIRG class with L_IR>3.6x10^11 L_sun.

The Lower Main Sequence and Mass Function of the Globular Cluster  Messier 4

  The deepest optical image ever in a globular star cluster, a Hubble SpaceTelescope (HST) 123 orbit exposure in a single field of Messier 4, was obtainedin 2 filters (F606W, F814W) over a 10 week period in early 2001. A somewhatshallower image obtained in 1995 allowed us to select out cluster and fieldobjects via their proper motion displacement resulting in remarkably cleancolor-magnitude diagrams that reach to V = 30, I = 28. The cluster mainsequence luminosity function contains very few stars fainter than MV = 15.0, MI= 11.8 which, in both filters, is more than 2 magnitudes brighter than ourlimit. This is about the faintest luminosity seen among field Population IIsubdwarfs of the same metallicity. However, there remains a sprinkling ofpotential cluster stars to lower luminosity all the way down to our limitingmagnitudes. These latter objects are significantly redder than any knownmetal-poor field subdwarf. Comparison with the current generation oftheoretical stellar models implies that the masses of the lowest luminositycluster stars observed are near 0.09 Msun. We derive the mass function of thecluster in our field and find that it is very slowly rising towards the lowestmasses with no convincing evidence of a turnover even below 0.1 Msun. Theformal slope between 0.65 and 0.09 Msun is alpha = 0.75 (Salpeter of 2.35) witha 99% confidence interval 0.55 - 1.05. A consistency check between these slopesand the number of observed cluster white dwarfs yields a range of possibleconclusions, one of which is that we have indeed seen the termination of thewhite dwarf cooling sequence in M4.

Learning Local Image Descriptors with Deep Siamese and Triplet  Convolutional Networks by Minimising Global Loss Functions

  Recent innovations in training deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet)models have motivated the design of new methods to automatically learn localimage descriptors. The latest deep ConvNets proposed for this task consist of asiamese network that is trained by penalising misclassification of pairs oflocal image patches. Current results from machine learning show that replacingthis siamese by a triplet network can improve the classification accuracy inseveral problems, but this has yet to be demonstrated for local imagedescriptor learning. Moreover, current siamese and triplet networks have beentrained with stochastic gradient descent that computes the gradient fromindividual pairs or triplets of local image patches, which can make them proneto overfitting. In this paper, we first propose the use of triplet networks forthe problem of local image descriptor learning. Furthermore, we also proposethe use of a global loss that minimises the overall classification error in thetraining set, which can improve the generalisation capability of the model.Using the UBC benchmark dataset for comparing local image descriptors, we showthat the triplet network produces a more accurate embedding than the siamesenetwork in terms of the UBC dataset errors. Moreover, we also demonstrate thata combination of the triplet and global losses produces the best embedding inthe field, using this triplet network. Finally, we also show that the use ofthe central-surround siamese network trained with the global loss produces thebest result of the field on the UBC dataset.

Neutron Star Masses from Arecibo Timing Observations of Five  Pulsar-White Dwarf Binary Systems

  We have detected relativistic and/or kinematic post-Keplerian parameters ofno fewer than five pulsar-white dwarf binary systems in long-term timingobservations at Arecibo. We discuss the resulting constraints on pulsar andcompanion masses. The general trend is that the pulsar mass measurements arecompatible with the canonical value of 1.35 solar masses, but in most casessomewhat higher masses are preferred.

Recent Globular Cluster Searches with Arecibo and the Green Bank  Telescope

  We report the discovery of seven new millisecond pulsars during 20 cmsearches of 19 globular clusters using the recently upgraded Arecibo Telescopeand the new Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Five of the pulsars are in compactbinaries, three of which are eclipsing. One of the systems is in an eccentricorbit which is almost certainly highly relativistic. Additional searches andtiming observations are underway.

Testing General Relativity with Pulsar Timing

  Pulsars of very different types - isolated objects, and binaries with short-and long-period orbits, white-dwarf and neutron-star companions - provide themeans to test both the predictions of general relativity and the viability ofalternate theories of gravity. This article presents an overview of pulsars,then discusses the current status and future prospects of tests of equivalenceprinciple violations and strong-field gravitational experiments.
