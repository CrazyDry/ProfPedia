Modeling Photographic Composition via Triangles

  The capacity of automatically modeling photographic composition is valuablefor many real-world machine vision applications such as digital photography,image retrieval, image understanding, and image aesthetics assessment. Thetriangle technique is among those indispensable composition methods on whichprofessional photographers often rely. This paper proposes a system that canidentify prominent triangle arrangements in two major categories ofphotographs: natural or urban scenes, and portraits. For the natural or urbanscene pictures, the focus is on the effect of linear perspective. Forportraits, we carefully examine the positioning of human subjects in a photo.We show that line analysis is highly advantageous for modeling composition inboth categories. Based on the detected triangles, new mathematical descriptorsfor composition are formulated and used to retrieve similar images. Leveragingthe rich source of high aesthetics photos online, similar approaches canpotentially be incorporated in future smart cameras to enhance a person's photocomposition skills.

Detecting Dominant Vanishing Points in Natural Scenes with Application  to Composition-Sensitive Image Retrieval

  Linear perspective is widely used in landscape photography to create theimpression of depth on a 2D photo. Automated understanding of linearperspective in landscape photography has several real-world applications,including aesthetics assessment, image retrieval, and on-site feedback forphoto composition, yet adequate automated understanding has been elusive. Weaddress this problem by detecting the dominant vanishing point and theassociated line structures in a photo. However, natural landscape scenes posegreat technical challenges because often the inadequate number of strong edgesconverging to the dominant vanishing point is inadequate. To overcome thisdifficulty, we propose a novel vanishing point detection method that exploitsglobal structures in the scene via contour detection. We show that our methodsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a public ground truthlandscape image dataset that we have created. Based on the detection results,we further demonstrate how our approach to linear perspective understandingprovides on-site guidance to amateur photographers on their work through anovel viewpoint-specific image retrieval system.

Image Based Review Text Generation with Emotional Guidance

  In the current field of computer vision, automatically generating texts fromgiven images has been a fully worked technique. Up till now, most works of thisarea focus on image content describing, namely image-captioning. However, rareresearches focus on generating product review texts, which is ubiquitous in theonline shopping malls and is crucial for online shopping selection andevaluation. Different from content describing, review texts include moresubjective information of customers, which may bring difference to the results.Therefore, we aimed at a new field concerning generating review text fromcustomers based on images together with the ratings of online shoppingproducts, which appear as non-image attributes. We made several adjustments tothe existing image-captioning model to fit our task, in which we should alsotake non-image features into consideration. We also did experiments based onour model and get effective primary results.

Sparsity and Robustness in Face Recognition

  This report concerns the use of techniques for sparse signal representationand sparse error correction for automatic face recognition. Much of the recentinterest in these techniques comes from the paper "Robust Face Recognition viaSparse Representation" by Wright et al. (2009), which showed how, under certaintechnical conditions, one could cast the face recognition problem as one ofseeking a sparse representation of a given input face image in terms of a"dictionary" of training images and images of individual pixels. In thisreport, we have attempted to clarify some frequently encountered questionsabout this work and particularly, on the validity of using sparserepresentation techniques for face recognition.

Stable Principal Component Pursuit

  In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix (theprincipal components) from a high-dimensional data matrix despite both smallentry-wise noise and gross sparse errors. Recently, it has been shown that aconvex program, named Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), can recover thelow-rank matrix when the data matrix is corrupted by gross sparse errors. Wefurther prove that the solution to a related convex program (a relaxed PCP)gives an estimate of the low-rank matrix that is simultaneously stable to smallentrywise noise and robust to gross sparse errors. More precisely, our resultshows that the proposed convex program recovers the low-rank matrix even thougha positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted, with an errorbound proportional to the noise level. We present simulation results to supportour result and demonstrate that the new convex program accurately recovers theprincipal components (the low-rank matrix) under quite broad conditions. To ourknowledge, this is the first result that shows the classical PrincipalComponent Analysis (PCA), optimal for small i.i.d. noise, can be made robust togross sparse errors; or the first that shows the newly proposed PCP can be madestable to small entry-wise perturbations.

Self-Charged Graphene Battery Harvests Electricity from Thermal Energy  of the Environment

  The energy of ionic thermal motion presents universally, which is as high as4 kJ\bullet kg-1\bullet K-1 in aqueous solution, where thermal velocity of ionsis in the order of hundreds of meters per second at room temperature1,2.Moreover, the thermal velocity of ions can be maintained by the externalenvironment, which means it is unlimited. However, little study has beenreported on converting the ionic thermal energy into electricity. Here wepresent a graphene device with asymmetric electrodes configuration to capturesuch ionic thermal energy and convert it into electricity. An output voltagearound 0.35 V was generated when the device was dipped into saturated CuCl2solution, in which this value lasted over twenty days. A positive correlationbetween the open-circuit voltage and the temperature, as well as the cationconcentration, was observed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this finding isof practical value by lighting a commercial light-emitting diode up with six ofsuch graphene devices connected in series. This finding provides a new way tounderstand the behavior of graphene at molecular scale and represents a hugebreakthrough for the research of self-powered technology. Moreover, the findingwill benefit quite a few applications, such as artificial organs, cleanrenewable energy and portable electronics.

Robust Influence Maximization

  In this paper, we address the important issue of uncertainty in the edgeinfluence probability estimates for the well studied influence maximizationproblem --- the task of finding $k$ seed nodes in a social network to maximizethe influence spread. We propose the problem of robust influence maximization,which maximizes the worst-case ratio between the influence spread of the chosenseed set and the optimal seed set, given the uncertainty of the parameterinput. We design an algorithm that solves this problem with asolution-dependent bound. We further study uniform sampling and adaptivesampling methods to effectively reduce the uncertainty on parameters andimprove the robustness of the influence maximization task. Our empiricalresults show that parameter uncertainty may greatly affect influencemaximization performance and prior studies that learned influence probabilitiescould lead to poor performance in robust influence maximization due torelatively large uncertainty in parameter estimates, and information cascadebased adaptive sampling method may be an effective way to improve therobustness of influence maximization.

Smart Library: Identifying Books in a Library using Richly Supervised  Deep Scene Text Reading

  Physical library collections are valuable and long standing resources forknowledge and learning. However, managing books in a large bookshelf andfinding books on it often leads to tedious manual work, especially for largebook collections where books might be missing or misplaced. Recently, deepneural models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent NeuralNetworks (RNN) have achieved great success for scene text detection andrecognition. Motivated by these recent successes, we aim to investigate theirviability in facilitating book management, a task that introduces furtherchallenges including large amounts of cluttered scene text, distortion, andvaried lighting conditions. In this paper, we present a library inventorybuilding and retrieval system based on scene text reading methods. Wespecifically design our scene text recognition model using rich supervision toaccelerate training and achieve state-of-the-art performance on severalbenchmark datasets. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly reduce theamount of human labor required in managing book inventories as well as thespace needed to store book information.

Fast L1-Minimization Algorithms For Robust Face Recognition

  L1-minimization refers to finding the minimum L1-norm solution to anunderdetermined linear system b=Ax. Under certain conditions as described incompressive sensing theory, the minimum L1-norm solution is also the sparsestsolution. In this paper, our study addresses the speed and scalability of itsalgorithms. In particular, we focus on the numerical implementation of asparsity-based classification framework in robust face recognition, wheresparse representation is sought to recover human identities from veryhigh-dimensional facial images that may be corrupted by illumination, facialdisguise, and pose variation. Although the underlying numerical problem is alinear program, traditional algorithms are known to suffer poor scalability forlarge-scale applications. We investigate a new solution based on a classicalconvex optimization framework, known as Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM). Thenew convex solvers provide a viable solution to real-world, time-criticalapplications such as face recognition. We conduct extensive experiments tovalidate and compare the performance of the ALM algorithms against severalpopular L1-minimization solvers, including interior-point method, Homotopy,FISTA, SESOP-PCD, approximate message passing (AMP) and TFOCS. To aid peerevaluation, the code for all the algorithms has been made publicly available.

Graph Construction with Label Information for Semi-Supervised Learning

  In the literature, most existing graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL)methods only use the label information of observed samples in the labelpropagation stage, while ignoring such valuable information when learning thegraph. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to consider the labelinformation in the graph learning stage. Specifically, by enforcing the weightof edges between labeled samples of different classes to be zero, we explicitlyincorporate the label information into the state-of-the-art graph learningmethods, such as the Low-Rank Representation (LRR), and propose a novelsemi-supervised graph learning method called Semi-Supervised Low-RankRepresentation (SSLRR). This results in a convex optimization problem withlinear constraints, which can be solved by the linearized alternating directionmethod. Though we take LRR as an example, our proposed method is in fact verygeneral and can be applied to any self-representation graph learning methods.Experiment results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that theproposed graph learning method can better capture the global geometricstructure of the data, and therefore is more effective for semi-supervisedlearning tasks.

Single-Image Piece-wise Planar 3D Reconstruction via Associative  Embedding

  Single-image piece-wise planar 3D reconstruction aims to simultaneouslysegment plane instances and recover 3D plane parameters from an image. Mostrecent approaches leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and achievepromising results. However, these methods are limited to detecting a fixednumber of planes with certain learned order. To tackle this problem, we proposea novel two-stage method based on associative embedding, inspired by its recentsuccess in instance segmentation. In the first stage, we train a CNN to mapeach pixel to an embedding space where pixels from the same plane instance havesimilar embeddings. Then, the plane instances are obtained by grouping theembedding vectors in planar regions via an efficient mean shift clusteringalgorithm. In the second stage, we estimate the parameter for each planeinstance by considering both pixel-level and instance-level consistencies. Withthe proposed method, we are able to detect an arbitrary number of planes.Extensive experiments on public datasets validate the effectiveness andefficiency of our method. Furthermore, our method runs at 30 fps at the testingtime, thus could facilitate many real-time applications such as visual SLAM andhuman-robot interaction.
