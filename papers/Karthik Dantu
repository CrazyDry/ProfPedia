Augmenting Visual SLAM with Wi-Fi Sensing For Indoor Applications

  Recent trends have accelerated the development of spatial applications onmobile devices and robots. These include navigation, augmented reality,human-robot interaction, and others. A key enabling technology for suchapplications is the understanding of the device's location and the map of thesurrounding environment. This generic problem, referred to as SimultaneousLocalization and Mapping (SLAM), is an extensively researched topic inrobotics. However, visual SLAM algorithms face several challenges includingperceptual aliasing and high computational cost. These challenges affect theaccuracy, efficiency, and viability of visual SLAM algorithms, especially forlong-term SLAM, and their use in resource-constrained mobile devices.  A parallel trend is the ubiquity of Wi-Fi routers for quick Internet accessin most urban environments. Most robots and mobile devices are equipped with aWi-Fi radio as well. We propose a method to utilize Wi-Fi received signalstrength to alleviate the challenges faced by visual SLAM algorithms. Todemonstrate the utility of this idea, this work makes the followingcontributions: (i) We propose a generic way to integrate Wi-Fi sensing intovisual SLAM algorithms, (ii) We integrate such sensing into three well-knownSLAM algorithms, (iii) Using four distinct datasets, we demonstrate theperformance of such augmentation in comparison to the original visualalgorithms and (iv) We compare our work to Wi-Fi augmented FABMAP algorithm.Overall, we show that our approach can improve the accuracy of visual SLAMalgorithms by 11% on average and reduce computation time on average by 15% to25%.
