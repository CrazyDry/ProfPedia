Anomalous Fermion Production in Gravitational Collapse

  The Dirac equation is solved in the Einstein-Yang-Mills background found byBartnik and McKinnon. We find a normalizable zero-energy fermion mode in the$s$-wave sector. As shown recently, their solution corresponds to agravitational sphaleron which mediates transitions between topologicallydistinct vacua. Since the Bartnik-McKinnon solution is unstable, it will eithercollapse to form a black hole or radiate away its energy. In either case, asthe Chern-Simons number of the configuration changes, there will be anaccompanying anomalous change in fermion number.

Fermion Quasi-normal modes of the Kerr Black-Hole

  In this paper we study the fermion quasi-normal modes of a 4-dimensionalrotating black-hole using the WKB(J) (to third and sixth order) and the AIMsemi-analytic methods in the massless Dirac fermion sector. These semi-analyticapproximations are computed in a pedagogical manner with comparisons made tothe numerical values of the quasi-normal mode frequencies presented in theliterature. It was found that The WKB(J) method and AIM show good agreementwith direct numerical solutions for low values of the overtone number $n$ andangular quantum number l.

Data Augmentation for Neural Online Chat Response Selection

  Data augmentation seeks to manipulate the available data for training toimprove the generalization ability of models. We investigate two dataaugmentation proxies, permutation and flipping, for neural dialog responseselection task on various models over multiple datasets, including both Chineseand English languages. Different from standard data augmentation techniques,our method combines the original and synthesized data for prediction. Empiricalresults show that our approach can gain 1 to 3 recall-at-1 points over baselinemodels in both full-scale and small-scale settings.

Style Transfer Through Multilingual and Feedback-Based Back-Translation

  Style transfer is the task of transferring an attribute of a sentence (e.g.,formality) while maintaining its semantic content. The key challenge in styletransfer is to strike a balance between the competing goals, one to preservemeaning and the other to improve the style transfer accuracy. Prior researchhas identified that the task of meaning preservation is generally harder toattain and evaluate. This paper proposes two extensions of the state-of-the-artstyle transfer models aiming at improving the meaning preservation in styletransfer. Our evaluation shows that these extensions help to ground meaningbetter while improving the transfer accuracy.

Black is to Criminal as Caucasian is to Police:Detecting and Removing  Multiclass Bias in Word Embeddings

  Online texts -- across genres, registers, domains, and styles -- are riddledwith human stereotypes, expressed in overt or subtle ways. Word embeddings,trained on these texts, perpetuate and amplify these stereotypes, and propagatebiases to machine learning models that use word embeddings as features. In thiswork, we propose a method to debias word embeddings in multiclass settings suchas race and religion, extending the work of (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) from thebinary setting, such as binary gender. Next, we propose a novel methodology forthe evaluation of multiclass debiasing. We demonstrate that our multiclassdebiasing is robust and maintains the efficacy in standard NLP tasks.

A Deep Learning Approach to Data-driven Parameterizations for  Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis

  Nearly all Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesizers today use Mel Cepstralcoefficients as the vocal tract parameterization of the speech signal. MelCepstral coefficients were never intended to work in a parametric speechsynthesis framework, but as yet, there has been little success in creating abetter parameterization that is more suited to synthesis. In this paper, we usedeep learning algorithms to investigate a data-driven parameterizationtechnique that is designed for the specific requirements of synthesis. Wecreate an invertible, low-dimensional, noise-robust encoding of the Mel LogSpectrum by training a tapered Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA). This SDA isthen unwrapped and used as the initialization for a Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP). The MLP is fine-tuned by training it to reconstruct the input at theoutput layer. This MLP is then split down the middle to form encoding anddecoding networks. These networks produce a parameterization of the Mel LogSpectrum that is intended to better fulfill the requirements of synthesis.Results are reported for experiments conducted using this resultingparameterization with the ClusterGen speech synthesizer.

Finding Function in Form: Compositional Character Models for Open  Vocabulary Word Representation

  We introduce a model for constructing vector representations of words bycomposing characters using bidirectional LSTMs. Relative to traditional wordrepresentation models that have independent vectors for each word type, ourmodel requires only a single vector per character type and a fixed set ofparameters for the compositional model. Despite the compactness of this modeland, more importantly, the arbitrary nature of the form-function relationshipin language, our "composed" word representations yield state-of-the-art resultsin language modeling and part-of-speech tagging. Benefits over traditionalbaselines are particularly pronounced in morphologically rich languages (e.g.,Turkish).

Character-based Neural Machine Translation

  We introduce a neural machine translation model that views the input andoutput sentences as sequences of characters rather than words. Since word-levelinformation provides a crucial source of bias, our input model composesrepresentations of character sequences into representations of words (asdetermined by whitespace boundaries), and then these are translated using ajoint attention/translation model. In the target language, the translation ismodeled as a sequence of word vectors, but each word is generated one characterat a time, conditional on the previous character generations in each word. Asthe representation and generation of words is performed at the character level,our model is capable of interpreting and generating unseen word forms. Asecondary benefit of this approach is that it alleviates much of the challengesassociated with preprocessing/tokenization of the source and target languages.We show that our model can achieve translation results that are on par withconventional word-based models.

Recurrent Neural Network Postfilters for Statistical Parametric Speech  Synthesis

  In the last two years, there have been numerous papers that have looked intousing Deep Neural Networks to replace the acoustic model in traditionalstatistical parametric speech synthesis. However, far less attention has beenpaid to approaches like DNN-based postfiltering where DNNs work in conjunctionwith traditional acoustic models. In this paper, we investigate the use ofRecurrent Neural Networks as a potential postfilter for synthesis. We explorethe possibility of replacing existing postfilters, as well as highlight theease with which arbitrary new features can be added as input to the postfilter.We also tried a novel approach of jointly training the Classification AndRegression Tree and the postfilter, rather than the traditional approach oftraining them independently.

Polyglot Neural Language Models: A Case Study in Cross-Lingual Phonetic  Representation Learning

  We introduce polyglot language models, recurrent neural network modelstrained to predict symbol sequences in many different languages using sharedrepresentations of symbols and conditioning on typological information aboutthe language to be predicted. We apply these to the problem of modeling phonesequences---a domain in which universal symbol inventories andcross-linguistically shared feature representations are a natural fit.Intrinsic evaluation on held-out perplexity, qualitative analysis of thelearned representations, and extrinsic evaluation in two downstreamapplications that make use of phonetic features show (i) that polyglot modelsbetter generalize to held-out data than comparable monolingual models and (ii)that polyglot phonetic feature representations are of higher quality than thoselearned monolingually.

Learning Conversational Systems that Interleave Task and Non-Task  Content

  Task-oriented dialog systems have been applied in various tasks, such asautomated personal assistants, customer service providers and tutors. Thesesystems work well when users have clear and explicit intentions that arewell-aligned to the systems' capabilities. However, they fail if usersintentions are not explicit. To address this shortcoming, we propose aframework to interleave non-task content (i.e. everyday social conversation)into task conversations. When the task content fails, the system can still keepthe user engaged with the non-task content. We trained a policy usingreinforcement learning algorithms to promote long-turn conversation coherenceand consistency, so that the system can have smooth transitions between taskand non-task content. To test the effectiveness of the proposed framework, wedeveloped a movie promotion dialog system. Experiments with human usersindicate that a system that interleaves social and task content achieves abetter task success rate and is also rated as more engaging compared to a puretask-oriented system.

Linguistic Markers of Influence in Informal Interactions

  There has been a long standing interest in understanding `Social Influence'both in Social Sciences and in Computational Linguistics. In this paper, wepresent a novel approach to study and measure interpersonal influence in dailyinteractions. Motivated by the basic principles of influence, we attempt toidentify indicative linguistic features of the posts in an online knittingcommunity. We present the scheme used to operationalize and label the postswith indicator features. Experiments with the identified features show animprovement in the classification accuracy of influence by 3.15%. Our resultsillustrate the important correlation between the characteristics of thelanguage and its potential to influence others.

Style Transfer Through Back-Translation

  Style transfer is the task of rephrasing the text to contain specificstylistic properties without changing the intent or affect within the context.This paper introduces a new method for automatic style transfer. We first learna latent representation of the input sentence which is grounded in a languagetranslation model in order to better preserve the meaning of the sentence whilereducing stylistic properties. Then adversarial generation techniques are usedto make the output match the desired style. We evaluate this technique on threedifferent style transformations: sentiment, gender and political slant.Compared to two state-of-the-art style transfer modeling techniques we showimprovements both in automatic evaluation of style transfer and in manualevaluation of meaning preservation and fluency.

Generating Mandarin and Cantonese F0 Contours with Decision Trees and  BLSTMs

  This paper models the fundamental frequency contours on both Mandarin andCantonese speech with decision trees and DNNs (deep neural networks). Differentkinds of f0 representations and model architectures are tested for decisiontrees and DNNs. A new model called Additive-BLSTM (additive bidirectional longshort term memory) that predicts a base f0 contour and a residual f0 contourwith two BLSTMs is proposed. With respect to objective measures of RMSE andcorrelation, applying tone-dependent trees together with sample normalizationand delta feature regularization within decision tree framework performs best.While the new Additive-BLSTM model with delta feature regularization performseven better. Subjective listening tests on both Mandarin and Cantonesecomparing Random Forest model (multiple decision trees) and the Additive-BLSTMmodel were also held and confirmed the advantage of the new model according tothe listeners' preference.

Domain Robust Feature Extraction for Rapid Low Resource ASR Development

  Developing a practical speech recognizer for a low resource language ischallenging, not only because of the (potentially unknown) properties of thelanguage, but also because test data may not be from the same domain as theavailable training data. In this paper, we focus on the latter challenge, i.e.domain mismatch, for systems trained using a sequence-based criterion. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of using a pre-trained English recognizer, whichis robust to such mismatched conditions, as a domain normalizing featureextractor on a low resource language. In our example, we use TurkishConversational Speech and Broadcast News data. This enables rapid developmentof speech recognizers for new languages which can easily adapt to any domain.Testing in various cross-domain scenarios, we achieve relative improvements ofaround 25% in phoneme error rate, with improvements being around 50% for somedomains.

A Dataset for Document Grounded Conversations

  This paper introduces a document grounded dataset for text conversations. Wedefine "Document Grounded Conversations" as conversations that are about thecontents of a specified document. In this dataset the specified documents wereWikipedia articles about popular movies. The dataset contains 4112conversations with an average of 21.43 turns per conversation. This positionsthis dataset to not only provide a relevant chat history while generatingresponses but also provide a source of information that the models could use.We describe two neural architectures that provide benchmark performance on thetask of generating the next response. We also evaluate our models forengagement and fluency, and find that the information from the document helpsin generating more engaging and fluent responses.

Multimodal Polynomial Fusion for Detecting Driver Distraction

  Distracted driving is deadly, claiming 3,477 lives in the U.S. in 2015 alone.Although there has been a considerable amount of research on modeling thedistracted behavior of drivers under various conditions, accurate automaticdetection using multiple modalities and especially the contribution of usingthe speech modality to improve accuracy has received little attention. Thispaper introduces a new multimodal dataset for distracted driving behavior anddiscusses automatic distraction detection using features from three modalities:facial expression, speech and car signals. Detailed multimodal feature analysisshows that adding more modalities monotonically increases the predictiveaccuracy of the model. Finally, a simple and effective multimodal fusiontechnique using a polynomial fusion layer shows superior distraction detectionresults compared to the baseline SVM and neural network models.

The Second Conversational Intelligence Challenge (ConvAI2)

  We describe the setting and results of the ConvAI2 NeurIPS competition thataims to further the state-of-the-art in open-domain chatbots. Some keytakeaways from the competition are: (i) pretrained Transformer variants arecurrently the best performing models on this task, (ii) but to improveperformance on multi-turn conversations with humans, future systems must gobeyond single word metrics like perplexity to measure the performance acrosssequences of utterances (conversations) -- in terms of repetition, consistencyand balance of dialogue acts (e.g. how many questions asked vs. answered).

Phoneme Level Language Models for Sequence Based Low Resource ASR

  Building multilingual and crosslingual models help bring different languagestogether in a language universal space. It allows models to share parametersand transfer knowledge across languages, enabling faster and better adaptationto a new language. These approaches are particularly useful for low resourcelanguages. In this paper, we propose a phoneme-level language model that can beused multilingually and for crosslingual adaptation to a target language. Weshow that our model performs almost as well as the monolingual models by usingsix times fewer parameters, and is capable of better adaptation to languagesnot seen during training in a low resource scenario. We show that thesephoneme-level language models can be used to decode sequence basedConnectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) acoustic model outputs to obtaincomparable word error rates with Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) baseddecoding in Babel languages. We also show that these phoneme-level languagemodels outperform WFST decoding in various low-resource conditions likeadapting to a new language and domain mismatch between training and testingdata.

  This paper describes the ARIEL-CMU submissions to the Low Resource HumanLanguage Technologies (LoReHLT) 2018 evaluations for the tasks MachineTranslation (MT), Entity Discovery and Linking (EDL), and detection ofSituation Frames in Text and Speech (SF Text and Speech).

A Survey of Code-switched Speech and Language Processing

  Code-switching, the alternation of languages within a conversation orutterance, is a common communicative phenomenon that occurs in multilingualcommunities across the world. This survey reviews computational approaches forcode-switched Speech and Natural Language Processing. We motivate whyprocessing code-switched text and speech is essential for building intelligentagents and systems that interact with users in multilingual communities. Ascode-switching data and resources are scarce, we list what is available invarious code-switched language pairs with the language processing tasks theycan be used for. We review code-switching research in various Speech and NLPapplications, including language processing tools and end-to-end systems. Weconclude with future directions and open problems in the field.

  This short document is intended as a companion and introduction to theDetailed Science Case (DSC) for the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer. Itprovides a concise summary of the essential characteristics of MSE from theperspective of the international astronomical community. MSE is a wide fieldtelescope (1.5 square degree field of view) with an aperture of 11.25m. It isdedicated to multi-object spectroscopy at several different spectralresolutions in the range R ~ 2500 - 40000 over a broad wavelength range (0.36 -1.8{\mu}m). MSE will enable transformational science in areas as diverse asexoplanetary host characterization; stellar monitoring campaigns; tomographicmapping of the interstellar and intergalactic media; the in-situ chemicaltagging of the distant Galaxy; connecting galaxies to the large scale structureof the Universe; measuring the mass functions of cold dark matter sub-halos ingalaxy and cluster-scale hosts; reverberation mapping of supermassive blackholes in quasars. MSE is the largest ground based optical and near infraredtelescope in its class, and it will occupy a unique and critical role in theemerging network of astronomical facilities active in the 2020s. MSE is anessential follow-up facility to current and next generations ofmulti-wavelength imaging surveys, including LSST, Gaia, Euclid, eROSITA, SKA,and WFIRST, and is an ideal feeder facility for E-ELT, TMT and GMT.

Detection of Galactic Center source G2 at 3.8 $μ$m during periapse  passage

  We report new observations of the Galactic Center source G2 from the W. M.Keck Observatory. G2 is a dusty red object associated with gas that shows tidalinteractions as it nears closest approach with the Galaxy's central black hole.Our observations, conducted as G2 passed through periapse, were designed totest the proposal that G2 is a 3 earth mass gas cloud. Such a cloud should betidally disrupted during periapse passage. The data were obtained using theKeck II laser guide star adaptive optics system (LGSAO) and the facilitynear-infrared camera (NIRC2) through the K' [2.1 $\mu$m] and L' [3.8 $\mu$m]broadband filters. Several results emerge from these observations: 1) G2 hassurvived its closest approach to the black hole as a compact, unresolved sourceat L'; 2) G2's L' brightness measurements are consistent with those over thelast decade; 3) G2's motion continues to be consistent with a Keplerian model.These results rule out G2 as a pure gas cloud and imply that G2 has a centralstar. This star has a luminosity of $\sim$30 $L_{\odot} $ and is surrounded bya large ($\sim$2.6 AU) optically thick dust shell. The differences between theL' and Br-$\gamma$ observations can be understood with a model in which L' andBr-$\gamma$ emission arises primarily from internal and external heating,respectively. We suggest that G2 is a binary star merger product and willultimately appear similar to the B-stars that are tightly clustered around theblack hole (the so-called S-star cluster).

Dark-ages Reionization and Galaxy Formation Simulation - X. The small  contribution of quasars to reionization

  Motivated by recent measurements of the number density of faint AGN at highredshift, we investigate the contribution of quasars to reionization bytracking the growth of central supermassive black holes in an update of theMeraxes semi-analytic model. The model is calibrated against the observedstellar mass function at $z\sim0.6-7$, the black hole mass function at$z\lesssim0.5$, the global ionizing emissivity at $z\sim2-5$ and the Thomsonscattering optical depth. The model reproduces a Magorrian relation inagreement with observations at $z<0.5$ and predicts a decreasing black holemass towards higher redshifts at fixed total stellar mass. With theimplementation of an opening angle of 80 deg for quasar radiation,corresponding to an observable fraction of ${\sim}23.4$ per cent due toobscuration by dust, the model is able to reproduce the observed quasarluminosity function at $z\sim0.6-6$. The stellar light from galaxies hostingfaint AGN contributes a significant or dominant fraction of the UV flux. Athigh redshift, the model is consistent with the bright end quasar luminosityfunction and suggests that the recent faint $z\sim4$ AGN sample compiled byGiallongo et al. (2015) includes a significant fraction of stellar light.Direct application of this luminosity function to the calculation of AGNionizing emissivity consequently overestimates the number of ionizing photonsproduced by quasars by a factor of 3 at $z\sim6$. We conclude that quasars areunlikely to make a significant contribution to reionization.

Characterizing X-ray and Radio emission in the Black Hole X-Ray Binary  V404 Cygni during Quiescence

  We present results from multi-wavelength simultaneous X-ray and radioobservations of the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg in quiescence. Ourcoverage with NuSTAR provides the very first opportunity to study the X-rayspectrum of V404 Cyg at energies above 10 keV. The unabsorbed broad-band(0.3--30 keV) quiescent luminosity of the source is 8.9$\times$10$^{32}$ ergs$^{-1}$ for a distance of 2.4 kpc. The source shows clear variability on shorttime scales (an hour to a couple of hours) in radio, soft X-ray and hard X-raybands in the form of multiple flares. The broad-band X-ray spectra obtainedfrom XMM-Newton and NuSTAR can be characterized with a power-law model havingphoton index $\Gamma$=2.12$\pm$0.07 (90\% confidence errors); however,residuals at high energies indicate spectral curvature significant at a3$\sigma$ confidence level with e-folding energy of the cutoff to be20$^{+20}_{-7}$ keV. Such curvature can be explained using synchrotron emissionfrom the base of a jet outflow. Radio observations using the VLA reveal thatthe spectral index evolves on very fast time-scales (as short as 10 min.),switching between optically thick and thin synchrotron emission, possibly dueto instabilities in the compact jet or stochastic instabilities in accretionrate. We explore different scenarios to explain this very fast variability.

Sequence-based Multi-lingual Low Resource Speech Recognition

  Techniques for multi-lingual and cross-lingual speech recognition can help inlow resource scenarios, to bootstrap systems and enable analysis of newlanguages and domains. End-to-end approaches, in particular sequence-basedtechniques, are attractive because of their simplicity and elegance. While itis possible to integrate traditional multi-lingual bottleneck featureextractors as front-ends, we show that end-to-end multi-lingual training ofsequence models is effective on context independent models trained usingConnectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We show that our modelimproves performance on Babel languages by over 6% absolute in terms ofword/phoneme error rate when compared to mono-lingual systems built in the samesetting for these languages. We also show that the trained model can be adaptedcross-lingually to an unseen language using just 25% of the target data. Weshow that training on multiple languages is important for very low resourcecross-lingual target scenarios, but not for multi-lingual testing scenarios.Here, it appears beneficial to include large well prepared datasets.

Disk-Jet Connection in the Radio Galaxy 3C 120

  We present the results of extensive multi-frequency monitoring of the radiogalaxy 3C 120 between 2002 and 2007 at X-ray, optical, and radio wave bands, aswell as imaging with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Over the 5 yr ofobservation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed byejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. Consistent withthis, the X-ray flux and 37 GHz flux are anti-correlated with X-ray leading theradio variations. This implies that, in this radio galaxy, the radiative stateof accretion disk plus corona system, where the X-rays are produced, has adirect effect on the events in the jet, where the radio emission originates.The X-ray power spectral density of 3C 120 shows a break, with steeper slope atshorter timescale and the break timescale is commensurate with the mass of thecentral black hole based on observations of Seyfert galaxies and black holeX-ray binaries. These findings provide support for the paradigm that black holeX-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei are fundamentally similar systems,with characteristic time and size scales linearly proportional to the mass ofthe central black hole. The X-ray and optical variations are stronglycorrelated in 3C 120, which implies that the optical emission in this objectarises from the same general region as the X-rays, i.e., in the accretiondisk-corona system. We numerically model multi-wavelength light curves of 3C120 from such a system with the optical-UV emission produced in the disk andthe X-rays generated by scattering of thermal photons by hot electrons in thecorona. From the comparison of the temporal properties of the model lightcurves to that of the observed variability, we constrain the physical size ofthe corona and the distances of the emitting regions from the central BH.

Connection between the Accretion Disk and Jet in the Radio Galaxy 3C 111

  We present the results of extensive multi-frequency monitoring of the radiogalaxy 3C 111 between 2004 and 2010 at X-ray (2.4--10 keV), optical (R band),and radio (14.5, 37, and 230 GHz) wave bands, as well as multi-epoch imagingwith the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. Over the six years ofobservation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed byejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. This shows a clearconnection between the radiative state near the black hole, where the X-raysare produced, and events in the jet. The X-ray continuum flux and Fe lineintensity are strongly correlated, with a time lag shorter than 90 days andconsistent with zero. This implies that the Fe line is generated within 90light-days of the source of the X-ray continuum. The power spectral densityfunction of X-ray variations contains a break, with steeper slope at shortertimescales. The break timescale of 13 (+12,-6) days is commensurate withscaling according to the mass of the central black hole based on observationsof Seyfert galaxies and black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). The data areconsistent with the standard paradigm, in which the X-rays are predominantlyproduced by inverse Compton scattering of thermal optical/UV seed photons fromthe accretion disk by a distribution of hot electrons --- the corona ---situated near the disk. Most of the optical emission is generated in theaccretion disk due to reprocessing of the X-ray emission. The relationshipsthat we have uncovered between the accretion disk and the jet in 3C 111, aswell as in the FR I radio galaxy 3C 120 in a previous paper, support theparadigm that active galactic nuclei and Galactic BHXRBs are fundamentallysimilar, with characteristic time and size scales proportional to the mass ofthe central black hole

The 1.4 mm core of Centaurus A: First VLBI results with the South Pole  Telescope

  Centaurus A (Cen A) is a bright radio source associated with the nearbygalaxy NGC 5128 where high-resolution radio observations can probe the jet atscales of less than a light-day. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the AtacamaPathfinder Experiment (APEX) performed a single-baseline very-long-baselineinterferometry (VLBI) observation of Cen A in January 2015 as part of VLBIreceiver deployment for the SPT. We measure the correlated flux density of CenA at a wavelength of 1.4 mm on a $\sim$7000 km (5 G$\lambda$) baseline.Ascribing this correlated flux density to the core, and with the use of acontemporaneous short-baseline flux density from a Submillimeter Arrayobservation, we infer a core brightness temperature of $1.4 \times 10^{11}$ K.This is close to the equipartition brightness temperature, where the magneticand relativistic particle energy densities are equal. Under the assumption of acircular Gaussian core component, we derive an upper limit to the core size$\phi = 34.0 \pm 1.8~\mu\textrm{as}$, corresponding to 120 Schwarzschild radiifor a black hole mass of $5.5 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$.

The Fast, Luminous Ultraviolet Transient AT2018cow: Extreme Supernova,  or Disruption of a Star by an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole?

  Wide-field optical surveys have begun to uncover large samples of fast(t_rise < 5d), luminous (M_peak < -18), blue transients. While commonlyattributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the greatdistances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailedinvestigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy froma comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn), the firstfast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low redshift. Ourfirst spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broadabsorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between3-8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after>10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and thephotospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R<10^14 cm after 1month). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although arelativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observedfeatures. Alternatively, the transient could originate from the disruption of astar by an intermediate-mass black hole, although this would requirelong-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In eithercase, AT2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transientsrepresents a new class of astrophysical event. Intensive follow-up of thisevent in its late phases, and of any future events found at comparabledistance, will be essential to better constrain their origins.

Catching Element Formation In The Act

  Gamma-ray astronomy explores the most energetic photons in nature to addresssome of the most pressing puzzles in contemporary astrophysics. It encompassesa wide range of objects and phenomena: stars, supernovae, novae, neutron stars,stellar-mass black holes, nucleosynthesis, the interstellar medium, cosmic raysand relativistic-particle acceleration, and the evolution of galaxies. MeVgamma-rays provide a unique probe of nuclear processes in astronomy, directlymeasuring radioactive decay, nuclear de-excitation, and positron annihilation.The substantial information carried by gamma-ray photons allows us to seedeeper into these objects, the bulk of the power is often emitted at gamma-rayenergies, and radioactivity provides a natural physical clock that adds uniqueinformation. New science will be driven by time-domain population studies atgamma-ray energies. This science is enabled by next-generation gamma-rayinstruments with one to two orders of magnitude better sensitivity, larger skycoverage, and faster cadence than all previous gamma-ray instruments. Thistransformative capability permits: (a) the accurate identification of thegamma-ray emitting objects and correlations with observations taken at otherwavelengths and with other messengers; (b) construction of new gamma-ray mapsof the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies where extended regions aredistinguished from point sources; and (c) considerable serendipitous science ofscarce events -- nearby neutron star mergers, for example. Advances intechnology push the performance of new gamma-ray instruments to address a wideset of astrophysical questions.
