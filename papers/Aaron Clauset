Evolutionary Model of Species Body Mass Diversification

  We present a quantitative model for the biological evolution of species bodymasses within large groups of related species, e.g., terrestrial mammals, inwhich body mass M evolves according to branching (speciation), multiplicativediffusion, and an extinction probability that increases logarithmically withmass. We describe this evolution in terms of a convection-diffusion-reactionequation for ln M. The steady-state behavior is in good agreement withempirical data on recent terrestrial mammals, and the time-dependent behavioralso agrees with data on extinct mammal species between 95 - 50 Myr ago.

On the frequency and severity of interstate wars

  Lewis Fry Richardson argued that the frequency and severity of deadlyconflicts of all kinds, from homicides to interstate wars and everything inbetween, followed universal statistical patterns: their frequency followed asimple Poisson arrival process and their severity followed a simple power-lawdistribution. Although his methods and data in the mid-20th century wereneither rigorous nor comprehensive, his insights about violent conflicts haveendured. In this chapter, using modern statistical methods and data, we showthat Richardson's original claims appear largely correct, with a few caveats.These facts place important constraints on our understanding of the underlyingmechanisms that produce individual wars and periods of peace, and shed light onthe persistent debate about trends in conflict.

How Do Networks Become Navigable?

  Networks created and maintained by social processes, such as the humanfriendship network and the World Wide Web, appear to exhibit the property ofnavigability: namely, not only do short paths exist between any pair of nodes,but such paths can easily be found using only local information. It has beenshown that for networks with an underlying metric, algorithms using only localinformation perform extremely well if there is a power-law distribution of linklengths. However, it is not clear why or how real networks might develop thisdistribution. In this paper we define a decentralized ``rewiring'' process,inspired by surfers on the Web, in which each surfer attempts to travel fromtheir home page to a random destination, and updates the outgoing link fromtheir home page if this journey takes too long. We show that this process doesindeed cause the link length distribution to converge to a power law, achievinga routing time of O(log^2 n) on networks of size n. We also study finite-sizeeffects on the optimal exponent, and show that it converges polylogarithmicallyslowly as the lattice size goes to infinity.

Traceroute sampling makes random graphs appear to have power law degree  distributions

  The topology of the Internet has typically been measured by samplingtraceroutes, which are roughly shortest paths from sources to destinations. Theresulting measurements have been used to infer that the Internet's degreedistribution is scale-free; however, many of these measurements have relied onsampling traceroutes from a small number of sources. It was recently arguedthat sampling in this way can introduce a fundamental bias in the degreedistribution, for instance, causing random (Erdos-Renyi) graphs to appear tohave power law degree distributions. We explain this phenomenon analyticallyusing differential equations to model the growth of a breadth-first tree in arandom graph G(n,p=c/n) of average degree c, and show that sampling from asingle source gives an apparent power law degree distribution P(k) ~ 1/k for k< c.

Why Mapping the Internet is Hard

  Despite great effort spent measuring topological features of large networkslike the Internet, it was recently argued that sampling based on taking pathsthrough the network (e.g., traceroutes) introduces a fundamental bias in theobserved degree distribution. We examine this bias analytically andexperimentally. For classic random graphs with mean degree c, we showanalytically that traceroute sampling gives an observed degree distributionP(k) ~ 1/k for k < c, even though the underlying degree distribution isPoisson. For graphs whose degree distributions have power-law tails P(k) ~k^-alpha, the accuracy of traceroute sampling is highly sensitive to thepopulation of low-degree vertices. In particular, when the graph has a largeexcess (i.e., many more edges than vertices), traceroute sampling cansignificantly misestimate alpha.

Accuracy and Scaling Phenomena in Internet Mapping

  A great deal of effort has been spent measuring topological features of theInternet. However, it was recently argued that sampling based on taking pathsor traceroutes through the network from a small number of sources introduces afundamental bias in the observed degree distribution. We examine this biasanalytically and experimentally. For Erdos-Renyi random graphs with mean degreec, we show analytically that traceroute sampling gives an observed degreedistribution P(k) ~ 1/k for k < c, even though the underlying degreedistribution is Poisson. For graphs whose degree distributions have power-lawtails P(k) ~ k^-alpha, traceroute sampling from a small number of sources cansignificantly underestimate the value of \alpha when the graph has a largeexcess (i.e., many more edges than vertices). We find that in order to obtain agood estimate of alpha it is necessary to use a number of sources which growslinearly in the average degree of the underlying graph. Based on theseobservations we comment on the accuracy of the published values of alpha forthe Internet.

Scale Invariance in Global Terrorism

  Traditional analyses of international terrorism have not sought to explainthe emergence of rare but extremely severe events. Using the tools of extremalstatistics to analyze the set of terrorist attacks worldwide between 1968 and2004, as compiled by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention ofTerrorism (MIPT), we find that the relationship between the frequency andseverity of terrorist attacks exhibits the ``scale-free'' property with anexponent of close to two. This property is robust, even when we restrict ouranalysis to events from a single type of weapon or events within majorindustrialized nations. We also find that the distribution of event sizes haschanged very little over the past 37 years, suggesting that scale invariance isan inherent feature of global terrorism.

Finding local community structure in networks

  Although the inference of global community structure in networks has recentlybecome a topic of great interest in the physics community, all such algorithmsrequire that the graph be completely known. Here, we define both a measure oflocal community structure and an algorithm that infers the hierarchy ofcommunities that enclose a given vertex by exploring the graph one vertex at atime. This algorithm runs in time O(d*k^2) for general graphs when $d$ is themean degree and k is the number of vertices to be explored. For graphs whereexploring a new vertex is time-consuming, the running time is linear, O(k). Weshow that on computer-generated graphs this technique compares favorably toalgorithms that require global knowledge. We also use this algorithm to extractmeaningful local clustering information in the large recommender network of anonline retailer and show the existence of mesoscopic structure.

Scale Invariance in Road Networks

  We study the topological and geographic structure of the national roadnetworks of the United States, England and Denmark. By transforming thesenetworks into their dual representation, where roads are vertices and an edgeconnects two vertices if the corresponding roads ever intersect, we show thatthey exhibit both topological and geographic scale invariance. That is, we showthat for sufficiently large geographic areas, the dual degree distributionfollows a power law with exponent 2.2 < alpha < 2.4, and that journeys,regardless of their length, have a largely identical structure. To explainthese properties, we introduce and analyze a simple fractal model of roadplacement that reproduces the observed structure, and suggests a testableconnection between the scaling exponent alpha and the fractal dimensionsgoverning the placement of roads and intersections.

On the Frequency of Severe Terrorist Events

  In the spirit of Richardson's original (1948) study of the statistics ofdeadly conflicts, we study the frequency and severity of terrorist attacksworldwide since 1968. We show that these events are uniformly characterized bythe phenomenon of scale invariance, i.e., the frequency scales as an inversepower of the severity, P(x) ~ x^-alpha. We find that this property is a robustfeature of terrorism, persisting when we control for economic development ofthe target country, the type of weapon used, and even for short time-scales.Further, we show that the center of the distribution oscillates slightly with aperiod of roughly tau ~ 13 years, that there exist significant temporalcorrelations in the frequency of severe events, and that current models ofevent incidence cannot account for these variations or the scale invarianceproperty of global terrorism. Finally, we describe a simple toy model for thegeneration of these statistics, and briefly discuss its implications.

Structural Inference of Hierarchies in Networks

  One property of networks that has received comparatively little attention ishierarchy, i.e., the property of having vertices that cluster together ingroups, which then join to form groups of groups, and so forth, up through alllevels of organization in the network. Here, we give a precise definition ofhierarchical structure, give a generic model for generating arbitraryhierarchical structure in a random graph, and describe a statisticallyprincipled way to learn the set of hierarchical features that most plausiblyexplain a particular real-world network. By applying this approach to twoexample networks, we demonstrate its advantages for the interpretation ofnetwork data, the annotation of graphs with edge, vertex and communityproperties, and the generation of generic null models for further hypothesistesting.

How many species have mass M?

  Within large taxonomic assemblages, the number of species with adult bodymass M is characterized by a broad but asymmetric distribution, with thelargest mass being orders of magnitude larger than the typical mass. Thiscanonical shape can be explained by cladogenetic diffusion that is boundedbelow by a hard limit on viable species mass and above by extinction risks thatincrease weakly with mass. Here we introduce and analytically solve asimplified cladogenetic diffusion model. When appropriately parameterized, thediffusion-reaction equation predicts mass distributions that are in goodagreement with data on 4002 terrestrial mammal from the late Quaternary and8617 extant bird species. Under this model, we show that a specific tradeoffbetween the strength of within-lineage drift toward larger masses (Cope's rule)and the increased risk of extinction from increased mass is necessary toproduce realistic mass distributions for both taxa. We then make severalpredictions about the evolution of avian species masses.

The evolution and distribution of species body size

  The distribution of species body size within taxonomic groups exhibits aheavy right-tail extending over many orders of magnitude, where most speciesare significantly larger than the smallest species. We provide a simple modelof cladogenetic diffusion over evolutionary time that omits explicit mechanismsfor inter-specific competition and other microevolutionary processes yet fullyexplains the shape of this distribution. We estimate the model's parametersfrom fossil data and find that it robustly reproduces the distribution of 4002mammal species from the late Quaternary. The observed fit suggests that theasymmetric distribution arises from a fundamental tradeoff between theshort-term selective advantages (Cope's rule) and long-term selective risks ofincreased species body size, in the presence of a taxon-specific lower limit onbody size.

Comment on Yu et al., "High Quality Binary Protein Interaction Map of  the Yeast Interactome Network." Science 322, 104 (2008)

  We test the claim by Yu et al. -- presented in Science 322, 104 (2008) --that the degree distribution of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)protein-interaction network is best approximated by a power law. Yu et al.consider three versions of this network. In all three cases, however, we findthe most likely power-law model of the data is distinct from and incompatiblewith the one given by Yu et al. Only one network admits good statisticalsupport for any power law, and in that case, the power law explains only thedistribution of the upper 10% of node degrees. These results imply that thereis considerably more structure present in the yeast interactome than suggestedby Yu et al., and that these networks should probably not be called "scalefree."

A generalized aggregation-disintegration model for the frequency of  severe terrorist attacks

  We present and analyze a model of the frequency of severe terrorist attacks,which generalizes the recently proposed model of Johnson et al. This model,which is based on the notion of self-organized criticality and which describeshow terrorist cells might aggregate and disintegrate over time, predicts thatthe distribution of attack severities should follow a power-law form with anexponent of alpha=5/2. This prediction is in good agreement with currentempirical estimates for terrorist attacks worldwide, which give alpha=2.4 \pm0.2, and which we show is independent of certain details of the model. We closeby discussing the utility of this model for understanding terrorism and thebehavior of terrorist organizations, and mention several productive ways itcould be extended mathematically or tested empirically.

The developmental dynamics of terrorist organizations

  We identify robust statistical patterns in the frequency and severity ofviolent attacks by terrorist organizations as they grow and age. Usinggroup-level static and dynamic analyses of terrorist events worldwide from1968-2008 and a simulation model of organizational dynamics, we show that theproduction of violent events tends to accelerate with increasing size andexperience. This coupling of frequency, experience and size arises from afundamental positive feedback loop in which attacks lead to growth which leadsto increased production of new attacks. In contrast, event severity isindependent of both size and experience. Thus larger, more experiencedorganizations are more deadly because they attack more frequently, not becausetheir attacks are more deadly, and large events are equally likely to come fromlarge and small organizations. These results hold across political ideologiesand time, suggesting that the frequency and severity of terrorism may beconstrained by fundamental processes.

Friends FTW! Friendship, Collaboration and Competition in Halo: Reach

  How important are friendships in determining success by individuals and teamsin complex collaborative environments? By combining a novel data set containingthe dynamics of millions of ad hoc teams from the popular multiplayer onlinefirst person shooter Halo: Reach with survey data on player demographics, playstyle, psychometrics and friendships derived from an anonymous online survey,we investigate the impact of friendship on collaborative and competitiveperformance. In addition to finding significant differences in player behavioracross these variables, we find that friendships exert a strong influence,leading to both improved individual and team performance--even aftercontrolling for the overall expertise of the team--and increased pro-socialbehaviors. Players also structure their in-game activities around socialopportunities, and as a result hidden friendship ties can be accuratelyinferred directly from behavioral time series. Virtual environments that enablesuch friendship effects will thus likely see improved collaboration andcompetition.

Persistence and periodicity in a dynamic proximity network

  The topology of social networks can be understood as being inherentlydynamic, with edges having a distinct position in time. Most characterizationsof dynamic networks discretize time by converting temporal information into asequence of network "snapshots" for further analysis. Here we study a highlyresolved data set of a dynamic proximity network of 66 individuals. We showthat the topology of this network evolves over a very broad distribution oftime scales, that its behavior is characterized by strong periodicities drivenby external calendar cycles, and that the conversion of inherentlycontinuous-time data into a sequence of snapshots can produce highly biasedestimates of network structure. We suggest that dynamic social networks exhibita natural time scale \Delta_{nat}, and that the best conversion of such dynamicdata to a discrete sequence of networks is done at this natural rate.

Scoring dynamics across professional team sports: tempo, balance and  predictability

  Despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamicswithin professional sports games, relative little is known about what patternsor principles, if any, cut across different sports. Using a comprehensive dataset of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college andprofessional (American) football, professional hockey, and professionalbasketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Acrossthese sports, scoring tempo---when scoring events occur---closely follows acommon Poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. Similarly, scoringbalance---how often a team wins an event---follows a common Bernoulli process,with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combiningthese processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they bothreproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict gameoutcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlyingwithin-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggestspecific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of theimplications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sportsdynamics.

Detectability thresholds and optimal algorithms for community structure  in dynamic networks

  We study the fundamental limits on learning latent community structure indynamic networks. Specifically, we study dynamic stochastic block models wherenodes change their community membership over time, but where edges aregenerated independently at each time step. In this setting (which is a specialcase of several existing models), we are able to derive the detectabilitythreshold exactly, as a function of the rate of change and the strength of thecommunities. Below this threshold, we claim that no algorithm can identify thecommunities better than chance. We then give two algorithms that are optimal inthe sense that they succeed all the way down to this limit. The first usesbelief propagation (BP), which gives asymptotically optimal accuracy, and thesecond is a fast spectral clustering algorithm, based on linearizing the BPequations. We verify our analytic and algorithmic results via numericalsimulation, and close with a brief discussion of extensions and open questions.

Power-law distributions in empirical data

  Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest andhave significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-madephenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws iscomplicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of thedistribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events-- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behaviorholds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such asleast-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates ofparameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methodsreturn accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give noindication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present aprincipled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-lawbehavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fittingmethods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statisticand likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with testson synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We alsoapply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range ofdifferent disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-lawdistribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with thedata while in others the power law is ruled out.

Hierarchical structure and the prediction of missing links in networks

  Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describingand quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studiessuggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, where verticesdivide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forthover multiple scales. In many cases these groups are found to correspond toknown functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules inbiochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, orgenetic regulatory networks), or communities in social networks. Here wepresent a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from networkdata and demonstrate that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explainand quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties ofnetworks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clusteringcoefficients, and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge ofhierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partiallyknown networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures thancompeting techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is acentral organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insightinto many network phenomena.

The performance of modularity maximization in practical contexts

  Although widely used in practice, the behavior and accuracy of the popularmodule identification technique called modularity maximization is not wellunderstood in practical contexts. Here, we present a broad characterization ofits performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify theresolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show thatthe modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits anexponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks aclear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximummodularity Q_max for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that itdepends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modulesit contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, weshow that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but notall, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules andthe distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of anymodularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously inscientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successfulat finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics candisagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude bydiscussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combininginformation from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.

How large should whales be?

  The evolution and distribution of species body sizes for terrestrial mammalsis well-explained by a macroevolutionary tradeoff between short-term selectiveadvantages and long-term extinction risks from increased species body size,unfolding above the 2g minimum size induced by thermoregulation in air. Here,we consider whether this same tradeoff, formalized as a constrainedconvection-reaction-diffusion system, can also explain the sizes of fullyaquatic mammals, which have not previously been considered. By replacing theterrestrial minimum with a pelagic one, at roughly 7000g, the terrestrialmammal tradeoff model accurately predicts, with no tunable parameters, theobserved body masses of all extant cetacean species, including the 175,000,000gBlue Whale. This strong agreement between theory and data suggests that auniversal macroevolutionary tradeoff governs body size evolution for allmammals, regardless of their habitat. The dramatic sizes of cetaceans can thusbe attributed mainly to the increased convective heat loss is water, whichshifts the species size distribution upward and pushes its right tail intoranges inaccessible to terrestrial mammals. Under this macroevolutionarytradeoff, the largest expected species occurs where the rate at whichsmaller-bodied species move up into large-bodied niches approximately equalsthe rate at which extinction removes them.

Estimating the historical and future probabilities of large terrorist  events

  Quantities with right-skewed distributions are ubiquitous in complex socialsystems, including political conflict, economics and social networks, and thesesystems sometimes produce extremely large events. For instance, the 9/11terrorist events produced nearly 3000 fatalities, nearly six times more thanthe next largest event. But, was this enormous loss of life statisticallyunlikely given modern terrorism's historical record? Accurately estimating theprobability of such an event is complicated by the large fluctuations in theempirical distribution's upper tail. We present a generic statistical algorithmfor making such estimates, which combines semi-parametric models of tailbehavior and a nonparametric bootstrap. Applied to a global database ofterrorist events, we estimate the worldwide historical probability of observingat least one 9/11-sized or larger event since 1968 to be 11-35%. These resultsare robust to conditioning on global variations in economic development,domestic versus international events, the type of weapon used and a truncatedhistory that stops at 1998. We then use this procedure to make a data-drivenstatistical forecast of at least one similar event over the next decade.

Structure and inference in annotated networks

  For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of thenetwork and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender ofindividuals in a social network, geographic location of nodes in the Internet,or cellular function of nodes in a gene regulatory network. Here we demonstratehow this "metadata" can be used to improve our analysis and understanding ofnetwork structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detectionin networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines anetwork and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be donewith either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata arecorrelated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead the methodlearns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadatadepending on whether they contain useful information. The learned correlationsare also of interest in their own right, allowing us to make predictions aboutthe community membership of nodes whose network connections are unknown. Wedemonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and onreal-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological, andtechnological domains.

Power-law distributions in binned empirical data

  Many man-made and natural phenomena, including the intensity of earthquakes,population of cities and size of international wars, are believed to followpower-law distributions. The accurate identification of power-law patterns hassignificant consequences for correctly understanding and modeling complexsystems. However, statistical evidence for or against the power-law hypothesisis complicated by large fluctuations in the empirical distribution's tail, andthese are worsened when information is lost from binning the data. We adapt thestatistically principled framework for testing the power-law hypothesis,developed by Clauset, Shalizi and Newman, to the case of binned data. Thisapproach includes maximum-likelihood fitting, a hypothesis test based on theKolmogorov--Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic and likelihood ratio tests forcomparing against alternative explanations. We evaluate the effectiveness ofthese methods on synthetic binned data with known structure, quantify the lossof statistical power due to binning, and apply the methods to twelve real-worldbinned data sets with heavy-tailed patterns.

Characterizing the structural diversity of complex networks across  domains

  The structure of complex networks has been of interest in many scientific andengineering disciplines over the decades. A number of studies in the field havebeen focused on finding the common properties among different kinds of networkssuch as heavy-tail degree distribution, small-worldness and modular structureand they have tried to establish a theory of structural universality in complexnetworks. However, there is no comprehensive study of network structure acrossa diverse set of domains in order to explain the structural diversity weobserve in the real-world networks. In this paper, we study 986 real-worldnetworks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to online socialnetworks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models.Our study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as randomforest and confusion matrix in order to show the relationships among networkdomains in terms of network structure. Our results indicate that there are somepartitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguishbased purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions ofnetwork categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraintsand/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the samepartition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results ofengineering by human being, etc. This suggests that the origin of a network,whether it's biological, technological or social, may not necessarily be adecisive factor of the formation of similar network structure. Our findingsshed light on the possible direction along which we could uncover the hiddenprinciples for the structural diversity of complex networks.

Finding community structure in very large networks

  The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic ofconsiderable recent interest within the physics community, but most methodsproposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of theircomputational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm fordetecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms:its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) whered is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Manyreal-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m ~ n and d ~ log n, inwhich case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log^2 n). As anexample of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network ofitems for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the networkbeing linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The networkhas more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithmcan extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scalepatterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.

Adapting to Non-stationarity with Growing Expert Ensembles

  When dealing with time series with complex non-stationarities, lowretrospective regret on individual realizations is a more appropriate goal thanlow prospective risk in expectation. Online learning algorithms providepowerful guarantees of this form, and have often been proposed for use withnon-stationary processes because of their ability to switch between differentforecasters or ``experts''. However, existing methods assume that the set ofexperts whose forecasts are to be combined are all given at the start, which isnot plausible when dealing with a genuinely historical or evolutionary system.We show how to modify the ``fixed shares'' algorithm for tracking the bestexpert to cope with a steadily growing set of experts, obtained by fitting newmodels to new data as it becomes available, and obtain regret bounds for thegrowing ensemble.

Environmental structure and competitive scoring advantages in team  competitions

  In most professional sports, the structure of the environment is kept neutralso that scoring imbalances may be attributed to differences in team skill. Itthus remains unknown what impact structural heterogeneities can have on scoringdynamics and producing competitive advantages. Applying a generative model ofscoring dynamics to roughly 10 million team competitions drawn from an onlinegame, we quantify the relationship between a competition's structure and itsscoring dynamics. Despite wide structural variations, we find the samethree-phase pattern in the tempo of events observed in many sports. Tempo andbalance are highly predictable from a competition's structural features aloneand teams exploit environmental heterogeneities for sustained competitiveadvantage. The most balanced competitions are associated with specificenvironmental heterogeneities, not from equally skilled teams. These resultsshed new light on the principles of balanced competition, and illustrate thepotential of online game data for investigating social dynamics andcompetition.

Adapting the Stochastic Block Model to Edge-Weighted Networks

  We generalize the stochastic block model to the important case in which edgesare annotated with weights drawn from an exponential family distribution. Thisgeneralization introduces several technical difficulties for model estimation,which we solve using a Bayesian approach. We introduce a variational algorithmthat efficiently approximates the model's posterior distribution for densegraphs. In specific numerical experiments on edge-weighted networks, thisweighted stochastic block model outperforms the common approach of firstapplying a single threshold to all weights and then applying the classicstochastic block model, which can obscure latent block structure in networks.This model will enable the recovery of latent structure in a broader range ofnetwork data than was previously possible.

Detecting change points in the large-scale structure of evolving  networks

  Interactions among people or objects are often dynamic in nature and can berepresented as a sequence of networks, each providing a snapshot of theinteractions over a brief period of time. An important task in analyzing suchevolving networks is change-point detection, in which we both identify thetimes at which the large-scale pattern of interactions changes fundamentallyand quantify how large and what kind of change occurred. Here, we formalize forthe first time the network change-point detection problem within an onlineprobabilistic learning framework and introduce a method that can reliably solveit. This method combines a generalized hierarchical random graph model with aBayesian hypothesis test to quantitatively determine if, when, and preciselyhow a change point has occurred. We analyze the detectability of our methodusing synthetic data with known change points of different types andmagnitudes, and show that this method is more accurate than several previouslyused alternatives. Applied to two high-resolution evolving social networks,this method identifies a sequence of change points that align with knownexternal "shocks" to these networks.

Efficiently inferring community structure in bipartite networks

  Bipartite networks are a common type of network data in which there are twotypes of vertices, and only vertices of different types can be connected. Whilebipartite networks exhibit community structure like their unipartitecounterparts, existing approaches to bipartite community detection havedrawbacks, including implicit parameter choices, loss of information throughone-mode projections, and lack of interpretability. Here we solve the communitydetection problem for bipartite networks by formulating a bipartite stochasticblock model, which explicitly includes vertex type information and may betrivially extended to $k$-partite networks. This bipartite stochastic blockmodel yields a projection-free and statistically principled method forcommunity detection that makes clear assumptions and parameter choices andyields interpretable results. We demonstrate this model's ability toefficiently and accurately find community structure in synthetic bipartitenetworks with known structure and in real-world bipartite networks with unknownstructure, and we characterize its performance in practical contexts.

A unified view of generative models for networks: models, methods,  opportunities, and challenges

  Research on probabilistic models of networks now spans a wide variety offields, including physics, sociology, biology, statistics, and machinelearning. These efforts have produced a diverse ecology of models and methods.Despite this diversity, many of these models share a common underlyingstructure: pairwise interactions (edges) are generated with probabilityconditional on latent vertex attributes. Differences between models generallystem from different philosophical choices about how to learn from data ordifferent empirically-motivated goals. The highly interdisciplinary nature ofwork on these generative models, however, has inhibited the development of aunified view of their similarities and differences. For instance, noveltheoretical models and optimization techniques developed in machine learningare largely unknown within the social and biological sciences, which haveinstead emphasized model interpretability. Here, we describe a unified view ofgenerative models for networks that draws together many of these disparatethreads and highlights the fundamental similarities and differences that spanthese fields. We then describe a number of opportunities and challenges forfuture work that are revealed by this view.

Predicting sports scoring dynamics with restoration and anti-persistence

  Professional team sports provide an excellent domain for studying thedynamics of social competitions. These games are constructed with simple,well-defined rules and payoffs that admit a high-dimensional set of possibleactions and nontrivial scoring dynamics. The resulting gameplay and efforts topredict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sportsprofessionals and enthusiasts. In this paper, we consider two online predictionproblems for team sports:~given a partially observed game Who will score next?and ultimately Who will win? We present novel interpretable generative modelsof within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) andon the last team to score (anti-persistence). We then apply these models tocomprehensive within-game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten yearperiod. By assessing these models' relative goodness-of-fit we shed new lighton the underlying mechanisms driving the observed scoring dynamics of eachsport. Furthermore, in both predictive tasks, the performance of our modelsconsistently outperforms baselines models, and our models make quantitativeassessments of the latent team skill, over time.

Environmental Changes and the Dynamics of Musical Identity

  Musical tastes reflect our unique values and experiences, our relationshipswith others, and the places where we live. But as each of these things changes,do our tastes also change to reflect the present, or remain fixed, reflectingour past? Here, we investigate how where a person lives shapes their musicalpreferences, using geographic relocation to construct quasi-natural experimentsthat measure short- and long-term effects. Analyzing comprehensive data on over16 million users on Spotify, we show that relocation within the United Stateshas only a small impact on individuals' tastes, which remain more similar tothose of their past environments. We then show that the age gap between aperson and the music they consume indicates that adolescence, and likely theirenvironment during these years, shapes their lifelong musical tastes. Ourresults demonstrate the robustness of individuals' musical identity, and shednew light on the development of preferences.

On the Bias of Traceroute Sampling; or, Power-law Degree Distributions  in Regular Graphs

  Understanding the structure of the Internet graph is a crucial step forbuilding accurate network models and designing efficient algorithms forInternet applications. Yet, obtaining its graph structure is a surprisinglydifficult task, as edges cannot be explicitly queried. Instead, empiricalstudies rely on traceroutes to build what are essentially single-source,all-destinations, shortest-path trees. These trees only sample a fraction ofthe network's edges, and a recent paper by Lakhina et al. found empiricallythat the resuting sample is intrinsically biased. For instance, the observeddegree distribution under traceroute sampling exhibits a power law even whenthe underlying degree distribution is Poisson.  In this paper, we study the bias of traceroute sampling systematically, and,for a very general class of underlying degree distributions, calculate thelikely observed distributions explicitly. To do this, we use a continuous-timerealization of the process of exposing the BFS tree of a random graph with agiven degree distribution, calculate the expected degree distribution of thetree, and show that it is sharply concentrated. As example applications of ourmachinery, we show how traceroute sampling finds power-law degree distributionsin both delta-regular and Poisson-distributed random graphs. Thus, our workputs the observations of Lakhina et al. on a rigorous footing, and extends themto nearly arbitrary degree distributions.

Detecting Friendship Within Dynamic Online Interaction Networks

  In many complex social systems, the timing and frequency of interactionsbetween individuals are observable but friendship ties are hidden. Recoveringthese hidden ties, particularly for casual users who are relatively lessactive, would enable a wide variety of friendship-aware applications in domainswhere labeled data are often unavailable, including online advertising andnational security. Here, we investigate the accuracy of multiple statisticalfeatures, based either purely on temporal interaction patterns or on thecooperative nature of the interactions, for automatically extracting latentsocial ties. Using self-reported friendship and non-friendship labels derivedfrom an anonymous online survey, we learn highly accurate predictors forrecovering hidden friendships within a massive online data set encompassing 18billion interactions among 17 million individuals of the popular online gameHalo: Reach. We find that the accuracy of many features improves as more dataaccumulates, and cooperative features are generally reliable. However,periodicities in interaction time series are sufficient to correctly classify95% of ties, even for casual users. These results clarify the nature offriendship in online social environments and suggest new opportunities and newprivacy concerns for friendship-aware applications that do not require thedisclosure of private friendship information.

Social Network Dynamics in a Massive Online Game: Network Turnover,  Non-densification, and Team Engagement in Halo Reach

  Online multiplayer games are a popular form of social interaction, used byhundreds of millions of individuals. However, little is known about the socialnetworks within these online games, or how they evolve over time. Understandinghuman social dynamics within massive online games can shed new light on socialinteractions in general and inform the development of more engaging systems.Here, we study a novel, large friendship network, inferred from nearly 18billion social interactions over 44 weeks between 17 million individuals in thepopular online game Halo: Reach. This network is one of the largest, mostdetailed temporal interaction networks studied to date, and provides a novelperspective on the dynamics of online friendship networks, as opposed to mereinteraction graphs. Initially, this network exhibits strong structural turnoverand decays rapidly from a peak size. In the following period, however, bothnetwork size and turnover stabilize, producing a dynamic structuralequilibrium. In contrast to other studies, we find that the Halo friendshipnetwork is non-densifying: both the mean degree and the average pairwisedistance are stable, suggesting that densification cannot occur whenmaintaining friendships is costly. Finally, players with greater long-termengagement exhibit stronger local clustering, suggesting a group-level socialengagement process. These results demonstrate the utility of online games forstudying social networks, shed new light on empirical temporal graph patterns,and clarify the claims of universality of network densification.

Learning Latent Block Structure in Weighted Networks

  Community detection is an important task in network analysis, in which we aimto learn a network partition that groups together vertices with similarcommunity-level connectivity patterns. By finding such groups of vertices withsimilar structural roles, we extract a compact representation of the network'slarge-scale structure, which can facilitate its scientific interpretation andthe prediction of unknown or future interactions. Popular approaches, includingthe stochastic block model, assume edges are unweighted, which limits theirutility by throwing away potentially useful information. We introduce the`weighted stochastic block model' (WSBM), which generalizes the stochasticblock model to networks with edge weights drawn from any exponential familydistribution. This model learns from both the presence and weight of edges,allowing it to discover structure that would otherwise be hidden when weightsare discarded or thresholded. We describe a Bayesian variational algorithm forefficiently approximating this model's posterior distribution over latent blockstructures. We then evaluate the WSBM's performance on both edge-existence andedge-weight prediction tasks for a set of real-world weighted networks. In allcases, the WSBM performs as well or better than the best alternatives on thesetasks.

Assembling thefacebook: Using heterogeneity to understand online social  network assembly

  Online social networks represent a popular and diverse class of social mediasystems. Despite this variety, each of these systems undergoes a generalprocess of online social network assembly, which represents the complicated andheterogeneous changes that transform newly born systems into mature platforms.However, little is known about this process. For example, how much of anetwork's assembly is driven by simple growth? How does a network's structurechange as it matures? How does network structure vary with adoption rates anduser heterogeneity, and do these properties play different roles at differentpoints in the assembly? We investigate these and other questions using a uniquedataset of online connections among the roughly one million users at the first100 colleges admitted to Facebook, captured just 20 months after its launch. Wefirst show that different vintages and adoption rates across this population ofnetworks reveal temporal dynamics of the assembly process, and that assembly isonly loosely related to network growth. We then exploit natural experimentsembedded in this dataset and complementary data obtained via Internetarchaeology to show that different subnetworks matured at different ratestoward similar end states. These results shed light on the processes andpatterns of online social network assembly, and may facilitate more effectivedesign for online social systems.

Untangling the roles of parasites in food webs with generative network  models

  Food webs represent the set of consumer-resource interactions among a set ofspecies that co-occur in a habitat, but most food web studies have omittedparasites and their interactions. Recent studies have provided conflictingevidence on whether including parasites changes food web structure, with somesuggesting that parasitic interactions are structurally distinct from thoseamong free-living species while others claim the opposite. Here, we describe aprincipled method for understanding food web structure that combines anefficient optimization algorithm from statistical physics called paralleltempering with a probabilistic generalization of the empirically well-supportedfood web niche model. This generative model approach allows us to rigorouslyestimate the degree to which interactions that involve parasites arestatistically distinguishable from interactions among free-living species,whether parasite niches behave similarly to free-living niches, and the degreeto which existing hypotheses about food web structure are naturally recovered.We apply this method to the well-studied Flensburg Fjord food web and show thatwhile predation on parasites, concomitant predation of parasites, and parasiticintraguild trophic interactions are largely indistinguishable from free-livingpredation interactions, parasite-host interactions are different. These resultsprovide a powerful new tool for evaluating the impact of classes of species andinteractions on food web structure to shed new light on the roles of parasitesin food webs
