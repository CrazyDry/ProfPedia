Personalized Emphasis Framing for Persuasive Message Generation

  In this paper, we present a study on personalized emphasis framing which canbe used to tailor the content of a message to enhance its appeal to differentindividuals. With this framework, we directly model content selection decisionsbased on a set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal traitsincluding personality (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness) and basichuman values (e.g., self-transcendence and hedonism). We also demonstrate howthe analysis results can be used in automated personalized content selectionfor persuasive message generation.

Automatically Infer Human Traits and Behavior from Social Media Data

  Given the complexity of human minds and their behavioral flexibility, itrequires sophisticated data analysis to sift through a large amount of humanbehavioral evidence to model human minds and to predict human behavior. Peoplecurrently spend a significant amount of time on social media such as Twitterand Facebook. Thus many aspects of their lives and behaviors have beendigitally captured and continuously archived on these platforms. This makessocial media a great source of large, rich and diverse human behavioralevidence. In this paper, we survey the recent work on applying machine learningto infer human traits and behavior from social media data. We will also pointout several future research directions.

An Intersectional Definition of Fairness

  We introduce a measure of fairness for algorithms and data with regard tomultiple protected attributes. Our proposed definition, differential fairness,is informed by the framework of intersectionality, which analyzes howinterlocking systems of power and oppression affect individuals alongoverlapping dimensions including race, gender, sexual orientation, class, anddisability. We show that our criterion behaves sensibly for any subset of theset of protected attributes, and we illustrate links to differential privacy. Acase study on census data demonstrates the utility of our approach.

Empirically Evaluating an Adaptable Spoken Dialogue System

  Recent technological advances have made it possible to build real-time,interactive spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications.However, when users do not respect the limitations of such systems, performancetypically degrades. Although users differ with respect to their knowledge ofsystem limitations, and although different dialogue strategies make systemlimitations more apparent to users, most current systems do not try to improveperformance by adapting dialogue behavior to individual users. This paperpresents an empirical evaluation of TOOT, an adaptable spoken dialogue systemfor retrieving train schedules on the web. We conduct an experiment in which 20users carry out 4 tasks with both adaptable and non-adaptable versions of TOOT,resulting in a corpus of 80 dialogues. The values for a wide range ofevaluation measures are then extracted from this corpus. Our results show thatadaptable TOOT generally outperforms non-adaptable TOOT, and that the utilityof adaptation depends on TOOT's initial dialogue strategies.

LDAExplore: Visualizing Topic Models Generated Using Latent Dirichlet  Allocation

  We present LDAExplore, a tool to visualize topic distributions in a givendocument corpus that are generated using Topic Modeling methods. LatentDirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one of the basic methods that is predominantlyused to generate topics. One of the problems with methods like LDA is thatusers who apply them may not understand the topics that are generated. Also,users may find it difficult to search correlated topics and correlateddocuments. LDAExplore, tries to alleviate these problems by visualizing topicand word distributions generated from the document corpus and allowing the userto interact with them. The system is designed for users, who have minimalknowledge of LDA or Topic Modelling methods. To evaluate our design, we run apilot study which uses the abstracts of 322 Information Visualization papers,where every abstract is considered a document. The topics generated are thenexplored by users. The results show that users are able to find correlateddocuments and group them based on topics that are similar.

An Uncertainty-Aware Approach for Exploratory Microblog Retrieval

  Although there has been a great deal of interest in analyzing customeropinions and breaking news in microblogs, progress has been hampered by thelack of an effective mechanism to discover and retrieve data of interest frommicroblogs. To address this problem, we have developed an uncertainty-awarevisual analytics approach to retrieve salient posts, users, and hashtags. Weextend an existing ranking technique to compute a multifaceted retrievalresult: the mutual reinforcement rank of a graph node, the uncertainty of eachrank, and the propagation of uncertainty among different graph nodes. Toillustrate the three facets, we have also designed a composite visualizationwith three visual components: a graph visualization, an uncertainty glyph, anda flow map. The graph visualization with glyphs, the flow map, and theuncertainty analysis together enable analysts to effectively find the mostuncertain results and interactively refine them. We have applied our approachto several Twitter datasets. Qualitative evaluation and two real-world casestudies demonstrate the promise of our approach for retrieving high-qualitymicroblog data.

\$1 Today or \$2 Tomorrow? The Answer is in Your Facebook Likes

  In economics and psychology, delay discounting is often used to characterizehow individuals choose between a smaller immediate reward and a larger delayedreward. People with higher delay discounting rate (DDR) often choose smallerbut more immediate rewards (a "today person"). In contrast, people with a lowerdiscounting rate often choose a larger future rewards (a "tomorrow person").Since the ability to modulate the desire of immediate gratification for longterm rewards plays an important role in our decision-making, the lowerdiscounting rate often predicts better social, academic and health outcomes. Incontrast, the higher discounting rate is often associated with problematicbehaviors such as alcohol/drug abuse, pathological gambling and credit carddefault. Thus, research on understanding and moderating delay discounting hasthe potential to produce substantial societal benefits.

Social Media-based Substance Use Prediction

  In this paper, we demonstrate how the state-of-the-art machine learning andtext mining techniques can be used to build effective social media-basedsubstance use detection systems. Since a substance use ground truth isdifficult to obtain on a large scale, to maximize system performance, weexplore different feature learning methods to take advantage of a large amountof unsupervised social media data. We also demonstrate the benefit of usingmulti-view unsupervised feature learning to combine heterogeneous userinformation such as Facebook `"likes" and "status updates" to enhance systemperformance. Based on our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC forpredicting tobacco use, 81% for alcohol use and 84% for drug use, all of whichsignificantly outperformed existing methods. Our investigation has alsouncovered interesting relations between a user's social media behavior (e.g.,word usage) and substance use.

Learning Domain-Specific Word Embeddings from Sparse Cybersecurity Texts

  Word embedding is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique thatautomatically maps words from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in anembedding space. It has been widely used in recent years to boost theperformance of a vari-ety of NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition,Syntac-tic Parsing and Sentiment Analysis. Classic word embedding methods suchas Word2Vec and GloVe work well when they are given a large text corpus. Whenthe input texts are sparse as in many specialized domains (e.g.,cybersecurity), these methods often fail to produce high-quality vectors. Inthis pa-per, we describe a novel method to train domain-specificword embeddingsfrom sparse texts. In addition to domain texts, our method also leveragesdiverse types of domain knowledge such as domain vocabulary and semanticrelations. Specifi-cally, we first propose a general framework to encodediverse types of domain knowledge as text annotations. Then we de-velop a novelWord Annotation Embedding (WAE) algorithm to incorporate diverse types of textannotations in word em-bedding. We have evaluated our method on twocybersecurity text corpora: a malware description corpus and a CommonVulnerability and Exposure (CVE) corpus. Our evaluation re-sults havedemonstrated the effectiveness of our method in learning domain-specific wordembeddings.

Bayesian Modeling of Intersectional Fairness: The Variance of Bias

  Intersectionality is a framework that analyzes how interlocking systems ofpower and oppression affect individuals along overlapping dimensions includingrace, gender, sexual orientation, class, and disability. Intersectionalitytheory therefore implies it is important that fairness in artificialintelligence systems be protected with regard to multi-dimensional protectedattributes. However, the measurement of fairness becomes statisticallychallenging in the multi-dimensional setting due to data sparsity, whichincreases rapidly in the number of dimensions, and in the values per dimension.We present a Bayesian probabilistic modeling approach for the reliable,data-efficient estimation of fairness with multi-dimensional protectedattributes, which we apply to novel intersectional fairness metrics.Experimental results on census data and the COMPAS criminal justice recidivismdataset demonstrate the utility of our methodology, and show that Bayesianmethods are valuable for the modeling and measurement of fairness in anintersectional context.
