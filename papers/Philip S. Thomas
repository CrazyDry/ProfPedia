Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function  Approximation and Action-Dependent Baselines

  We show how an action-dependent baseline can be used by the policy gradienttheorem using function approximation, originally presented withaction-independent baselines by (Sutton et al. 2000).

Data-Efficient Off-Policy Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning

  In this paper we present a new way of predicting the performance of areinforcement learning policy given historical data that may have beengenerated by a different policy. The ability to evaluate a policy fromhistorical data is important for applications where the deployment of a badpolicy can be dangerous or costly. We show empirically that our algorithmproduces estimates that often have orders of magnitude lower mean squared errorthan existing methods---it makes more efficient use of the available data. Ournew estimator is based on two advances: an extension of the doubly robustestimator (Jiang and Li, 2015), and a new way to mix between model basedestimates and importance sampling based estimates.

Increasing the Action Gap: New Operators for Reinforcement Learning

  This paper introduces new optimality-preserving operators on Q-functions. Wefirst describe an operator for tabular representations, the consistent Bellmanoperator, which incorporates a notion of local policy consistency. We show thatthis local consistency leads to an increase in the action gap at each state;increasing this gap, we argue, mitigates the undesirable effects ofapproximation and estimation errors on the induced greedy policies. Thisoperator can also be applied to discretized continuous space and time problems,and we provide empirical results evidencing superior performance in thiscontext. Extending the idea of a locally consistent operator, we then derivesufficient conditions for an operator to preserve optimality, leading to afamily of operators which includes our consistent Bellman operator. Ascorollaries we provide a proof of optimality for Baird's advantage learningalgorithm and derive other gap-increasing operators with interestingproperties. We conclude with an empirical study on 60 Atari 2600 gamesillustrating the strong potential of these new operators.

Importance Sampling with Unequal Support

  Importance sampling is often used in machine learning when training andtesting data come from different distributions. In this paper we propose a newvariant of importance sampling that can reduce the variance of importancesampling-based estimates by orders of magnitude when the supports of thetraining and testing distributions differ. After motivating and presenting ournew importance sampling estimator, we provide a detailed theoretical analysisthat characterizes both its bias and variance relative to the ordinaryimportance sampling estimator (in various settings, which include cases whereordinary importance sampling is biased, while our new estimator is not, andvice versa). We conclude with an example of how our new importance samplingestimator can be used to improve estimates of how well a new treatment policyfor diabetes will work for an individual, using only data from when theindividual used a previous treatment policy.

Decoupling Learning Rules from Representations

  In the artificial intelligence field, learning often corresponds to changingthe parameters of a parameterized function. A learning rule is an algorithm ormathematical expression that specifies precisely how the parameters should bechanged. When creating an artificial intelligence system, we must make twodecisions: what representation should be used (i.e., what parameterizedfunction should be used) and what learning rule should be used to searchthrough the resulting set of representable functions. Using most learningrules, these two decisions are coupled in a subtle (and often unintentional)way. That is, using the same learning rule with two different representationsthat can represent the same sets of functions can result in two differentoutcomes. After arguing that this coupling is undesirable, particularly whenusing artificial neural networks, we present a method for partially decouplingthese two decisions for a broad class of learning rules that span unsupervisedlearning, reinforcement learning, and supervised learning.

On Ensuring that Intelligent Machines Are Well-Behaved

  Machine learning algorithms are everywhere, ranging from simple data analysisand pattern recognition tools used across the sciences to complex systems thatachieve super-human performance on various tasks. Ensuring that they arewell-behaved---that they do not, for example, cause harm to humans or act in aracist or sexist way---is therefore not a hypothetical problem to be dealt within the future, but a pressing one that we address here. We propose a newframework for designing machine learning algorithms that simplifies the problemof specifying and regulating undesirable behaviors. To show the viability ofthis new framework, we use it to create new machine learning algorithms thatpreclude the sexist and harmful behaviors exhibited by standard machinelearning algorithms in our experiments. Our framework for designing machinelearning algorithms simplifies the safe and responsible application of machinelearning.

Saturation Spectroscopy of Iodine in Hollow-core Optical Fibre

  We present high-resolution spectroscopy of Iodine vapour that is loaded andtrapped within the core of a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre (HC-PCF). Wecompare the observed spectroscopic features to those seen in a conventionaliodine cell and show that the saturation characteristics differ significantly.Despite the confined geometry it was still possible to obtain sub-Dopplerfeatures with a spectral width of ~6 MHz with very high contrast. We provide asimple theory which closely reproduces all the key observations of theexperiment.

Hole Concentration Effect on the Microwave Nonlinearity of  Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8-d Superconducting Thin Films

  The carrier concentration of Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 films was modified by annealing inN2 gas. X-ray analysis of the structure and the oxygen content revealed acorrespondence between carrier concentration and oxygen depletion. The TC andnonlinear surface impedance was measured using a dielectric resonator and thenonlinearity slope parameter r=dXS/dRS was found to converge to unity at thecritical temperature, indicating a dominance of Josephson fluxon hysteresis onthe nonlinearity. Highly inductive nonlinearity was observed in a small rangeof doping levels between 0.180<p<0.195 holes/Cu, which does not include theoptimal doping level of 0.16 holes/Cu.

Privacy Preserving Off-Policy Evaluation

  Many reinforcement learning applications involve the use of data that issensitive, such as medical records of patients or financial information.However, most current reinforcement learning methods can leak informationcontained within the (possibly sensitive) data on which they are trained. Toaddress this problem, we present the first differentially private approach foroff-policy evaluation. We provide a theoretical analysis of theprivacy-preserving properties of our algorithm and analyze its utility (speedof convergence). After describing some results of this theoretical analysis, weshow empirically that our method outperforms previous methods (which arerestricted to the on-policy setting).

Coupling between QPOs and broadband noise components in GRS 1915+105

  We explore the use of the bispectrum for understanding quasiperiodicoscillations. The bispectrum is a statistic which probes the relations betweenthe relative phases of the Fourier spectrum at different frequencies. The useof the bispectrum allows us to break the degeneracies between different modelsfor time series which produce identical power spectra. We look at data fromseveral observations of GRS 1915+105 when the source shows strongquasi-periodic oscillations and strong broadband noise components in its powerspectrum. We show that, despite strong similarities in the power spectrum, thebispectra can differ strongly. In all cases, there are frequency ranges wherethe bicoherence, a measure of nonlinearity, is strong for frequencies involvingthe frequency of the quasi-periodic oscillations, indicating that thequasi-periodic oscillations are coupled to the noise components, rather thanbeing generated independently. We compare the bicoherences from the data tosimple models, finding some qualitative similarities.

Spitzer, Near-Infrared, and Submillimeter Imaging of the Relatively  Sparse Young Cluster, Lynds 988e

  We present {\it Spitzer} images of the relatively sparse, low luminosityyoung cluster L988e, as well as complementary near-infrared (NIR) andsubmillimeter images of the region. The cluster is asymmetric, with the westernregion of the cluster embedded within the molecular cloud, and the slightlyless dense eastern region to the east of, and on the edge of, the molecularcloud. With these data, as well as with extant H$\alpha$ data of starsprimarily found in the eastern region of the cluster, and a molecular $^{13}$COgas emission map of the entire region, we investigate the distribution offorming young stars with respect to the cloud material, concentratingparticularly on the differences and similarities between the exposed andembedded regions of the cluster. We also compare star formation in this regionto that in denser, more luminous and more massive clusters already investigatedin our comprehensive multi-wavelength study of young clusters within 1 kpc ofthe Sun.

Dissipation and the Fundamental Plane: Observational Tests

  We develop observational tests of the idea that dissipation in gas-richmergers produces the fundamental plane (FP) and related correlations obeyed byellipticals. The FP 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratioof stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models arguethat mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield largermass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e andhigher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristicimprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outerprofile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. Inprevious work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observedprofiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in theoriginal spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample ofobserved ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and itstilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in moredissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixeddegree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamicalmass estimator R_e*sigma^2/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observedFP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing theeffects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations asdisks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.Dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt.

IRAC Colors of Young Stellar Objects

  We compare the infrared colors predicted by theoretical models ofprotostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks with initial observations ofyoung stellar objects made with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the SpitzerSpace Telescope (Werner et al. 2004, Fazio et al. 2004). Disk and envelopemodels characterized by infall and/or accretion rates found in previous studiescan quantitatively account for the range of IRAC colors found in four youngembedded clusters: S 140, S 171, NGC 7129, and Cep C. The IRAC color-colordiagram ([3.6]-[4.5] vs. [5.8]-[8.0]) can be used to help to distinguishbetween young stars with only disk emission and protostars with circumstellarenvelopes.

Mesoscale Modeling of Impact Compaction of Primitive Solar System Solids

  We have developed a method for simulating the mesoscale compaction of earlysolar system solids in low velocity impact events, using the iSALE shockphysics code. Chondrules are represented by nonporous disks, placed within aporous matrix. By simulating impacts into bimodal mixtures over a wide range ofparameter space (including the chondrule-to-matrix ratio, the matrix porosityand composition and the impact velocity), we have shown how each of theseparameters influences the shock processing of heterogeneous materials. Thetemperature after shock processing shows a strong dichotomy: matrixtemperatures are elevated much higher than the chondrules, which remain largelycold. Chondrules can protect some matrix from shock compaction, with shadowregions in the lee side of chondrules exhibiting higher porosity that elsewherein the matrix. Using the results from this mesoscale modelling, we show how the$\varepsilon-\alpha$ porous compaction model parameters depend on initial bulkporosity. We also show that the timescale for the temperature dichotomy toequilibrate is highly dependent on the porosity of the matrix after the shock,and will be on the order of seconds for matrix porosities of less than 0.1, andon the order of 10's to 100's seconds for matrix porosities of $\sim$ 0.3--0.5.Finally, we have shown that the composition of the post-shock material is ableto match the bulk porosity and chondrule-to-matrix ratios of meteorite groupssuch as carbonaceous chondrites and unequilibrated ordinary chondrites.

The First Passage Probability of Intracellular Particle Trafficking

  The first passage probability (FPP), of trafficked intracellular particlesreaching a displacement L, in a given time t or inverse velocity S = t/L, canbe calculated robustly from measured particle tracks, and gives a measure ofparticle movement in which different types of motion, e.g. diffusion, ballisticmotion, and transient run-rest motion, can readily be distinguished in a singlegraph, and compared with mathematical models. The FPP is attractive in that itoffers a means of reducing the data in the measured tracks, without makingassumptions about the mechanism of motion: for example, it does not employsmoothing, segementation or arbitrary thresholds to discriminate betweendifferent types of motion in a particle track. Taking experimental data fromtracked endocytic vesicles, and calculating the FPP, we see how three moleculartreatments affect the trafficking. We show the FPP can quantify complicatedmovement which is neither completely random nor completely deterministic,making it highly applicable to trafficked particles in cell biology.

Relativistic Scott correction in self-generated magnetic fields

  We consider a large neutral molecule with total nuclear charge $Z$ in a modelwith self-generated classical magnetic field and where the kinetic energy ofthe electrons is treated relativistically. To ensure stability, we assume that$Z \alpha < 2/\pi$, where $\alpha$ denotes the fine structure constant. We areinterested in the ground state energy in the simultaneous limit $Z \rightarrow\infty$, $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ such that $\kappa=Z \alpha$ is fixed. Theleading term in the energy asymptotics is independent of $\kappa$, it is givenby the Thomas-Fermi energy of order $Z^{7/3}$ and it is unchanged by includingthe self-generated magnetic field. We prove the first correction term to thisenergy, the so-called Scott correction of the form $S(\alpha Z) Z^2$. Thecurrent paper extends the result of \cite{SSS} on the Scott correction forrelativistic molecules to include a self-generated magnetic field. Furthermore,we show that the corresponding Scott correction function $S$, first identifiedin \cite{SSS}, is unchanged by including a magnetic field. We also prove newLieb-Thirring inequalities for the relativistic kinetic energy with magneticfields.

Measuring velocity of sound with nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray  scattering

  Nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is used to measure the projectedpartial phonon density of states of materials. A relationship is derivedbetween the low-energy part of this frequency distribution function and thesound velocity of materials. Our derivation is valid for harmonic solids withDebye-like low-frequency dynamics. This method of sound velocity determinationis applied to elemental, composite, and impurity samples which arerepresentative of a wide variety of both crystalline and noncrystallinematerials. Advantages and limitations of this method are elucidated.

Feature Selection Strategies for Classifying High Dimensional  Astronomical Data Sets

  The amount of collected data in many scientific fields is increasing, all ofthem requiring a common task: extract knowledge from massive, multi parametricdata sets, as rapidly and efficiently possible. This is especially true inastronomy where synoptic sky surveys are enabling new research frontiers in thetime domain astronomy and posing several new object classification challengesin multi dimensional spaces; given the high number of parameters available foreach object, feature selection is quickly becoming a crucial task in analyzingastronomical data sets. Using data sets extracted from the ongoing CatalinaReal-Time Transient Surveys (CRTS) and the Kepler Mission we illustrate avariety of feature selection strategies used to identify the subsets that givethe most information and the results achieved applying these techniques tothree major astronomical problems.

Using Options and Covariance Testing for Long Horizon Off-Policy Policy  Evaluation

  Evaluating a policy by deploying it in the real world can be risky andcostly. Off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) algorithms use historical datacollected from running a previous policy to evaluate a new policy, whichprovides a means for evaluating a policy without requiring it to ever bedeployed. Importance sampling is a popular OPE method because it is robust topartial observability and works with continuous states and actions. However,the amount of historical data required by importance sampling can scaleexponentially with the horizon of the problem: the number of sequentialdecisions that are made. We propose using policies over temporally extendedactions, called options, and show that combining these policies with importancesampling can significantly improve performance for long-horizon problems. Inaddition, we can take advantage of special cases that arise due tooptions-based policies to further improve the performance of importancesampling. We further generalize these special cases to a general covariancetesting rule that can be used to decide which weights to drop in an ISestimate, and derive a new IS algorithm called Incremental Importance Samplingthat can provide significantly more accurate estimates for a broad class ofdomains.

Data-Efficient Policy Evaluation Through Behavior Policy Search

  We consider the task of evaluating a policy for a Markov decision process(MDP). The standard unbiased technique for evaluating a policy is to deploy thepolicy and observe its performance. We show that the data collected fromdeploying a different policy, commonly called the behavior policy, can be usedto produce unbiased estimates with lower mean squared error than this standardtechnique. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal behavior policy ---the behavior policy that minimizes the mean squared error of the resultingestimates. Because this expression depends on terms that are unknown inpractice, we propose a novel policy evaluation sub-problem, behavior policysearch: searching for a behavior policy that reduces mean squared error. Wepresent a behavior policy search algorithm and empirically demonstrate itseffectiveness in lowering the mean squared error of policy performanceestimates.

A Compression-Inspired Framework for Macro Discovery

  In this paper we consider the problem of how a reinforcement learning agenttasked with solving a set of related Markov decision processes can useknowledge acquired early in its lifetime to improve its ability to more rapidlysolve novel, but related, tasks. One way of exploiting this experience is byidentifying recurrent patterns in trajectories obtained from well-performingpolicies. We propose a three-step framework in which an agent 1) generates aset of candidate open-loop macros by compressing trajectories drawn fromnear-optimal policies; 2) evaluates the value of each macro; and 3) selects amaximally diverse subset of macros that spans the space of policies typicallyrequired for solving the set of related tasks. Our experiments show thatextending the original primitive action-set of the agent with the identifiedmacros allows it to more rapidly learn an optimal policy in unseen, but similarMDPs.

Natural Option Critic

  The recently proposed option-critic architecture Bacon et al. provide astochastic policy gradient approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning.Specifically, they provide a way to estimate the gradient of the expecteddiscounted return with respect to parameters that define a finite number oftemporally extended actions, called \textit{options}. In this paper we show howthe option-critic architecture can be extended to estimate the natural gradientof the expected discounted return. To this end, the central questions that weconsider in this paper are: 1) what is the definition of the natural gradientin this context, 2) what is the Fisher information matrix associated with anoption's parameterized policy, 3) what is the Fisher information matrixassociated with an option's parameterized termination function, and 4) how cana compatible function approximation approach be leveraged to obtain naturalgradient estimates for both the parameterized policy and parameterizedtermination functions of an option with per-time-step time and space complexitylinear in the total number of parameters. Based on answers to these questionswe introduce the natural option critic algorithm. Experimental results showcaseimprovement over the vanilla gradient approach.

Learning Action Representations for Reinforcement Learning

  Most model-free reinforcement learning methods leverage state representations(embeddings) for generalization, but either ignore structure in the space ofactions or assume the structure is provided a priori. We show how a policy canbe decomposed into a component that acts in a low-dimensional space of actionrepresentations and a component that transforms these representations intoactual actions. These representations improve generalization over large, finiteaction sets by allowing the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar toactions already taken. We provide an algorithm to both learn and use actionrepresentations and provide conditions for its convergence. The efficacy of theproposed method is demonstrated on large-scale real-world problems.

A Meta-MDP Approach to Exploration for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning

  In this paper we consider the problem of how a reinforcement learning agentthat is tasked with solving a sequence of reinforcement learning problems (asequence of Markov decision processes) can use knowledge acquired early in itslifetime to improve its ability to solve new problems. We argue that previousexperience with similar problems can provide an agent with information abouthow it should explore when facing a new but related problem. We show that thesearch for an optimal exploration strategy can be formulated as a reinforcementlearning problem itself and demonstrate that such strategy can leveragepatterns found in the structure of related problems. We conclude withexperiments that show the benefits of optimizing an exploration strategy usingour proposed approach.

Asynchronous Coagent Networks: Stochastic Networks for Reinforcement  Learning without Backpropagation or a Clock

  In this paper we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) approach fortraining policies, including artificial neural network policies, that is bothbackpropagation-free and clock-free. It is backpropagation-free in that it doesnot propagate any information backwards through the network. It is clock-freein that no signal is given to each node in the network to specify when itshould compute its output and when it should update its weights. We contendthat these two properties increase the biological plausibility of ouralgorithms and facilitate distributed implementations. Additionally, ourapproach eliminates the need for customized learning rules for hierarchical RLalgorithms like the option-critic.

Learning to Adapt for Stereo

  Real world applications of stereo depth estimation require models that arerobust to dynamic variations in the environment. Even though deep learningbased stereo methods are successful, they often fail to generalize to unseenvariations in the environment, making them less suitable for practicalapplications such as autonomous driving. In this work, we introduce a"learning-to-adapt" framework that enables deep stereo methods to continuouslyadapt to new target domains in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, ourapproach incorporates the adaptation procedure into the learning objective toobtain a base set of parameters that are better suited for unsupervised onlineadaptation. To further improve the quality of the adaptation, we learn aconfidence measure that effectively masks the errors introduced during theunsupervised adaptation. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real-worldstereo datasets and our experiments evidence that learning-to-adapt is, indeedbeneficial for online adaptation on vastly different domains.

EmpiriciSN: Re-sampling Observed Supernova/Host Galaxy Populations using  an XD Gaussian Mixture Model

  We describe two new open source tools written in Python for performingextreme deconvolution Gaussian mixture modeling (XDGMM) and using a conditionedmodel to re-sample observed supernova and host galaxy populations. XDGMM is newprogram for using Gaussian mixtures to do density estimation of noisy datausing extreme deconvolution (XD) algorithms that has functionality notavailable in other XD tools. It allows the user to select between the AstroML(Vanderplas et al. 2012; Ivezic et al. 2015) and Bovy et al. (2011) fittingmethods and is compatible with scikit-learn machine learning algorithms(Pedregosa et al. 2011). Most crucially, it allows the user to condition amodel based on the known values of a subset of parameters. This gives the userthe ability to produce a tool that can predict unknown parameters based on amodel conditioned on known values of other parameters. EmpiriciSN is an exampleapplication of this functionality that can be used for fitting an XDGMM modelto observed supernova/host datasets and predicting likely supernova parametersusing on a model conditioned on observed host properties. It is primarilyintended for simulating realistic supernovae for LSST data simulations based onempirical galaxy properties.

The Galaxy Stellar Mass Function and Low Surface Brightness Galaxies  from Core-Collapse Supernovae

  We introduce a method for producing a galaxy sample unbiased by surfacebrightness and stellar mass, by selecting star-forming galaxies via thepositions of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Whilst matching $\sim$2400supernovae from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey to their host galaxies using IACStripe 82 legacy coadded imaging, we find $\sim$150 previously unidentified lowsurface brightness galaxies (LSBGs). Using a sub-sample of $\sim$900 CCSNe, weinfer CCSN-rate and star-formation rate densities as a function of galaxystellar mass, and the star-forming galaxy stellar mass function. Resultantstar-forming galaxy number densities are found to increase following apower-law down to our low mass limit of $\sim10^{6.4}$ M$_{\odot}$ by a singleSchechter function with a faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.41$. Number densitiesare consistent with those found by the EAGLE simulations invoking a$\Lambda$-CDM cosmology. Overcoming surface brightness and stellar mass biasesis important for assessment of the sub-structure problem. In order to estimategalaxy stellar masses, a new code for the calculation of galaxy photometricredshifts, zMedIC, is also presented, and shown to be particularly useful forsmall samples of galaxies.

Peculiar Velocity Constraints from Five-Band SZ Effect Measurements  Towards RX J1347.5-1145 with MUSIC and Bolocam from the CSO

  We present Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect measurements from wide-field imagestowards the galaxy cluster RX J1347.5-1145 obtained from the CaltechSubmillimeter Observatory with the Multiwavelength Submillimeter InductanceCamera (MUSIC) at 147, 213, 281, and 337 GHz and with Bolocam at 140 GHz. Aspart of our analysis, we have used higher frequency data from Herschel-SPIREand previously published lower frequency radio data to subtract the signal fromthe brightest dusty star-forming galaxies behind RX J1347.5-1145 and from theAGN in RX J1347.5-1145's BCG. Using these five-band SZ effect images, combinedwith X-ray spectroscopic measurements of the temperature of the intra-clustermedium (ICM) from Chandra, we constrain the ICM optical depth to be $\tau_e =7.33^{+0.96}_{-0.97} \times 10^{-3}$ and the ICM line of sight peculiarvelocity to be $v_{pec} = -1040^{+870}_{-840}$ km s$^{-1}$. The errors for bothquantities are limited by measurement noise rather than calibrationuncertainties or astrophysical contamination, and significant improvements arepossible with deeper observations. Our best-fit velocity is in good agreementwith one previously published SZ effect analysis and in mild tension with theother, although some or all of that tension may be because that measurementsamples a much smaller cluster volume. Furthermore, our best-fit optical depthimplies a gas mass slightly larger than the Chandra-derived value, implying thecluster is elongated along the line of sight.

The Relation Between Quasar and Merging Galaxy Luminosity Functions and  the Merger-Induced Star Formation Rate of the Universe

  Using a model for self-regulated growth of black holes (BHs) in mergersinvolving gas-rich galaxies, we study the relationship between quasars and thepopulation of merging galaxies and predict the merger-induced star formationrate density of the Universe. Mergers drive nuclear gas inflows, fuelingstarbursts and 'buried quasars' until accretion feedback expels the gas,rendering a briefly visible optical quasar. Star formation is shut down andaccretion declines, leaving a passively evolving remnant with propertiestypical of red, elliptical galaxies. Based on evolution of these events in oursimulations, we demonstrate that the observed statistics of merger rates,luminosity functions (LFs) and mass functions, SFR distributions, specificSFRs, quasar and quasar host galaxy LFs, and elliptical/red galaxy LFs areself-consistent and follow from one another as predicted by the mergerhypothesis. We use our simulations to de-convolve both quasar and merginggalaxy LFs to determine the birthrate of black holes of a given final mass andmerger rates as a function of stellar mass. We use this to predict the merginggalaxy LF in several observed wavebands, color-magnitude relations, massfunctions, absolute and specific SFR distributions and SFR density, and quasarhost galaxy LFs, as a function of redshift from z=0-6. We invert this andpredict e.g. quasar LFs from observed merger LFs or SFR distributions. Ourresults agree well with observations, but idealized models of quasarlightcurves are ruled out by comparison of merger and quasar observations at>99.9% confidence. Using only observations of quasars, we estimate thecontribution of mergers to the SFR density of the Universe even to highredshifts z~4.

Dissipation and Extra Light in Galactic Nuclei: III. 'Core' Ellipticals  and 'Missing' Light

  We investigate how 'extra' central light in the surface brightness profilesof cusp ellipticals relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. Cuspelliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting onstars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipationalstarbursts. Core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)cusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve acompact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).Comparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how toobservationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals. Wedemonstrate that these survive re-mergers and reliably trace the dissipation inthe initial gas-rich merger(s). The typical degree of dissipation is a strongfunction of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions. We find acorrelation between dissipation and effective radius: systems with moredissipation are more compact. The survival of this component and scattering ofstars into the envelope naturally explain high-Sersic index profilescharacteristic of massive core ellipticals. This is also closely related to thekinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst componentsfrom their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/coreellipticals. We show that it is critical to adopt physically motivated profileswhen attempting to quantify how much mass has been 'scoured' or scattered outof the inner regions by binary black holes. Estimates of scoured mass ignoringmulti-component structure can be strongly biased, potentially explainingobserved systems with large inferred core masses in apparent conflict withcore-scouring models.

The Effects of Gas on Morphological Transformation in Mergers:  Implications for Bulge and Disk Demographics

  Transformation of disks into spheroids via mergers is a well-accepted elementof galaxy formation models. However, recent simulations have shown that bulgeformation is suppressed in increasingly gas-rich mergers. We investigate theglobal implications of these results in a cosmological framework, usingindependent approaches: empirical halo-occupation models (where galaxies arepopulated in halos according to observations) and semi-analytic models. Inboth, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the over-production ofspheroids: low and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to bebulge-dominated (B/T~0.5 at <10^10 M_sun), with almost no bulgeless systems),even if they have avoided major mergers. Including the different physicalbehavior of gas in mergers immediately leads to a dramatic change: bulgeformation is suppressed in low-mass galaxies, observed to be gas-rich (givingB/T~0.1 at <10^10 M_sun, with a number of bulgeless galaxies in good agreementwith observations). Simulations and analytic models which neglect thesimilarity-breaking behavior of gas have difficulty reproducing the strongobserved morphology-mass relation. However, the observed dependence of gasfractions on mass, combined with suppression of bulge formation in gas-richmergers, naturally leads to the observed trends. Discrepancies betweenobservations and models that ignore the role of gas increase with redshift; inmodels that treat gas properly, galaxies are predicted to be lessbulge-dominated at high redshifts, in agreement with the observations. Wediscuss implications for the global bulge mass density and future observationaltests.

The Herschel Orion Protostar Survey: Luminosity and Envelope Evolution

  The Herschel Orion Protostar Survey obtained well-sampled 1.2 - 870 micronspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of over 300 protostars in the Orionmolecular clouds, home to most of the young stellar objects (YSOs) in thenearest 500 pc. We plot the bolometric luminosities and temperatures for 330Orion YSOs, 315 of which have bolometric temperatures characteristic ofprotostars. The histogram of bolometric temperature is roughly flat; 29% of theprotostars are in Class 0. The median luminosity decreases by a factor of fourwith increasing bolometric temperature; consequently, the Class 0 protostarsare systematically brighter than the Class I protostars, with a medianluminosity of 2.3 L_sun as opposed to 0.87 L_sun. At a given bolometrictemperature, the scatter in luminosities is three orders of magnitude. Usingfits to the SEDs, we analyze how the luminosities corrected for inclination andforeground reddening relate to the mass in the inner 2500 AU of the best-fitmodel envelopes. The histogram of envelope mass is roughly flat, while themedian corrected luminosity peaks at 15 L_sun for young envelopes and falls to1.7 L_sun for late-stage protostars with remnant envelopes. The spread inluminosity at each envelope mass is three orders of magnitude. Envelope massesthat decline exponentially with time explain the flat mass histogram and thedecrease in luminosity, while the formation of a range of stellar massesexplains the dispersion in luminosity.

The Evolution of Protostars: Insights from Ten Years of Infrared Surveys  with Spitzer and Herschel

  Stars form from the gravitational collapse of dense molecular cloud cores. Inthe protostellar phase, mass accretes from the core onto a protostar, likelythrough an accretion disk, and it is during this phase that the initial massesof stars and the initial conditions for planet formation are set. Over the pastdecade, new observational capabilities provided by the Spitzer Space Telescopeand Herschel Space Observatory have enabled wide-field surveys of entirestar-forming clouds with unprecedented sensitivity, resolution, and infraredwavelength coverage. We review resulting advances in the field, focusing bothon the observations themselves and the constraints they place on theoreticalmodels of star formation and protostellar evolution. We also emphasize openquestions and outline new directions needed to further advance the field.

A programmable two-qubit quantum processor in silicon

  With qubit measurement and control fidelities above the threshold offault-tolerance, much attention is moving towards the daunting task of scalingup the number of physical qubits to the large numbers needed for fault tolerantquantum computing. Here, quantum dot based spin qubits may offer significantadvantages due to their potential for high densities, all-electrical operation,and integration onto an industrial platform. In this system, theinitialisation, readout, single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated invarious qubit representations. However, as seen with other small scale quantumcomputer demonstrations, combining these elements leads to new challengesinvolving qubit crosstalk, state leakage, calibration, and control hardwarewhich provide invaluable insight towards scaling up. Here we address thesechallenges and demonstrate a programmable two-qubit quantum processor insilicon by performing both the Deutsch-Josza and the Grover search algorithms.In addition, we characterise the entanglement in our processor through quantumstate tomography of Bell states measuring state fidelities between 85-89% andconcurrences between 73-80%. These results pave the way for larger scalequantum computers using spins confined to quantum dots.

A Spitzer View of Mon OB1 East/NGC 2264

  We present Spitzer 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 micron images of the Mon OB1East giant molecular cloud, which contains the young star forming region NGC2264, as well as more extended star formation. With Spitzer data and 2MASSphotometry, we identify and classify young stellar objects (YSOs) with dustycircumstellar disks and/or envelopes in Mon OB1 East by their infrared-excessemission and study their distribution with respect to cloud material. We find acorrelation between the local surface density of YSOs and column density ofmolecular gas as traced by dust extinction that is roughly described as a powerlaw in these quantities. NGC 2264 follows a power law index of ~2.7, exhibitinga large YSO surface density for a given gas column density. Outside of NGC 2264where the surface density of YSOs is lower, the power law is shallower and theregion exhibits a larger gas column density for a YSO surface density,suggesting the star formation is more recent. In order to measure the fractionof cloud members with circumstellar disks/envelopes, we estimate the number ofdiskless pre-main sequence stars by statistical removal of background stardetections. We find that the disk fraction of the NGC 2264 region is 45%, whilethe surrounding more distributed regions show a disk fraction of 19%. This maybe explained by the presence an older, more dispersed population of stars. Intotal, the Spitzer observations provide evidence for heterogenous, non-coevalstar formation throughout the Mon OB1 cloud.

A Catalog of Young Stellar Groups and Clusters Within 1kpc of the Sun

  We present a catalog of near-infrared surveys of young (<= a few 10^6 yr)stellar groups and clusters within 1 kpc from the Sun, based on an extensivesearch of the literature from the past ten years. We find 143 surveys from 69published articles, covering 73 different regions. The number distribution ofstars in a region has a median of 28 and a mean of 100. About 80% of the starsare in clusters with at least 100 members. By a rough classification of thegroups and clusters based on the number of their associated stars, we show thatmost of the stars form in large clusters. The spatial distribution of catalogedregions in the Galactic plane shows a relative lack of observed stellar groupsand clusters in the range 270 deg < l < 60 deg of Galactic longitude,reflecting our location between the Local and Sagittarius arms. Thiscompilation is intended as a useful resource for future studies of nearby youngregions of multiple star formation.

A Semi-Analytic Model for the Co-evolution of Galaxies, Black Holes, and  Active Galactic Nuclei

  We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growthof supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within the context ofthe LCDM cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accretingblack holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galacticscale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jetsthat heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present acomprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observationalmeasurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as coldgas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formationrates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponentialcutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densitiesat z~0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely,quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model ofself-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BHmass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies in ourmodels, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation,stellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. We find that models assuming the"concordance" LCDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass athigh redshift (z>2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less starformation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellarmass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas inquasar absorption systems at high redshift (z~3-4).

BLAST Observations of the South Ecliptic Pole field: Number Counts and  Source Catalogs

  We present results from a survey carried out by the Balloon-borne LargeAperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) on a 9 deg^2 field near the SouthEcliptic Pole at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m. The median 1{\sigma} depths of themaps are 36.0, 26.4 and 18.4 mJy, respectively. We apply a statistical methodto estimate submillimeter galaxy number counts and find that they are inagreement with other measurements made with the same instrument and with themore recent results from Herschel/SPIRE. Thanks to the large field observed,the new measurements give additional constraints on the bright end of thecounts. We identify 132, 89 and 61 sources with S/N>4 at 250, 350, 500 {\mu}m,respectively and provide a multi-wavelength combined catalog of 232 sourceswith a significance >4{\sigma} in at least one BLAST band. The new BLAST mapsand catalogs are available publicly at http://blastexperiment.info.

Stimulated emission from NV centres in diamond

  Stimulated emission is the process fundamental to laser operation, therebyproducing coherent photon output. Despite negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy(NV$^-$) centres being discussed as a potential laser medium since the 1980's,there have been no definitive observations of stimulated emission fromensembles of NV$^-$ to date. Reasons for this lack of demonstration include theshort excited state lifetime and the occurrence of photo-ionisation to theneutral charge state by light around the zero-phonon line. Here we show boththeoretical and experimental evidence for stimulated emission from NV$^-$states using light in the phonon-sidebands. Our system uses a continuous wavepump laser at 532 nm and a pulsed stimulating laser that is swept across thephononic sidebands of the NV$^-$. Optimal stimulated emission is demonstratedin the vicinity of the three-phonon line at 700 nm. Furthermore, we show thetransition from stimulated emission to photoionisation as the stimulating laserwavelength is reduced from 700nm to 620 nm. While lasing at the zero-phononline is suppressed by ionisation, our results open the possibility of diamondlasers based on NV centres, tuneable over the phonon-sideband. This broadensthe applications of NV magnetometers from single centre nanoscale sensors to anew generation of ultra-precise ensemble laser sensors, which exploit thecontrast and signal amplification of a lasing system.

astroquery: An Astronomical Web-Querying Package in Python

  astroquery is a collection of tools for requesting data from databases hostedon remote servers with interfaces exposed on the internet, including those withweb pages but without formal application program interfaces (APIs). These toolsare built on the Python requests package, which is used to make HTTP requests,and astropy, which provides most of the data parsing functionality. astroquerymodules generally attempt to replicate the web page interface provided by agiven service as closely as possible, making the transition from browser-basedto command-line interaction easy. astroquery has received significantcontributions from throughout the astronomical community, including severalsignificant contributions from telescope archives. astroquery enables thecreation of fully reproducible workflows from data acquisition throughpublication. This paper describes the philosophy, basic structure, anddevelopment model of the astroquery package. The complete documentation forastroquery can be found at http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/.

Efficient Relaxations for Dense CRFs with Sparse Higher Order Potentials

  Dense conditional random fields (CRFs) have become a popular framework formodelling several problems in computer vision such as stereo correspondence andmulti-class semantic segmentation. By modelling long-range interactions, denseCRFs provide a labelling that captures finer detail than their sparsecounterparts. Currently, the state-of-the-art algorithm performs mean-fieldinference using a filter-based method but fails to provide a strong theoreticalguarantee on the quality of the solution. A question naturally arises as towhether it is possible to obtain a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of adense CRF using a principled method. Within this paper, we show that this isindeed possible. We will show that, by using a filter-based method, continuousrelaxations of the MAP problem can be optimised efficiently usingstate-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically, we will solve a quadraticprogramming (QP) relaxation using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and a linearprogramming (LP) relaxation by developing a proximal minimisation framework. Byexploiting labelling consistency in the higher-order potentials and utilisingthe filter-based method, we are able to formulate the above algorithms suchthat each iteration has a complexity linear in the number of classes and randomvariables. The presented algorithms can be applied to any labelling problemusing a dense CRF with sparse higher-order potentials. In this paper, we usesemantic segmentation as an example application as it demonstrates the abilityof the algorithm to scale to dense CRFs with large dimensions. We performexperiments on the Pascal dataset to indicate that the presented algorithms areable to attain lower energies than the mean-field inference method.

Radio and mid-infrared identification of BLAST source counterparts in  the Chandra Deep Field South

  We have identified radio and/or mid-infrared counterparts to 198 out of 350sources detected at >=5 sigma over ~ 9 square degrees centered on the ChandraDeep Field South (CDFS) by the Balloon-borne Large Aperture SubmillimeterTelescope (BLAST) at 250, 350 and 500 um. We have matched 114 of thesecounterparts to optical sources with previously derived photometric redshiftsand fitted SEDs to the BLAST fluxes and fluxes at 70 and 160 um acquired withthe Spitzer Space Telescope. In this way, we have constrained dusttemperatures, total far-infrared/sub-millimeter luminosities and star formationrates for each source. Our findings show that on average, the BLAST sources lieat significantly lower redshifts and have significantly lower rest-frame dusttemperatures compared to submm sources detected in surveys conducted at 850 um.We demonstrate that an apparent increase in dust temperature with redshift inour sample arises as a result of selection effects. Finally, we provide thefull multi-wavelength catalog of >= 5 sigma BLAST sources contained within thecomplete ~ 9 square degree survey area.

Spectral features of Earth-like planets and their detectability at  different orbital distances around F, G, and K-type stars

  We investigate the spectral appearance of Earth-like exoplanets in the HZ ofdifferent main sequence stars at different orbital distances. We furthermorediscuss for which of these scenarios biomarker absorption bands may be detectedduring primary or secondary transit with near-future telescopes andinstruments.We analyze the spectra taking into account different filterbandpasses of two photometric instruments planned to be mounted to the JWST. Weanalyze in which filters and for which scenarios molecular absorption bands aredetectable when using the space-borne JWST or the ground-based telescope E-ELT.Absorption bands of CO2, H2O, CH4 and O3 are clearly visible in high-resolutionspectra as well as in the filters of photometric instruments. However, onlyduring primary eclipse bands of CO2, H2O and O3 are detectable for allscenarios when using photometric instruments and an E-ELT telescope setup. CH4is only detectable at the outer HZ of the K star since here the atmosphericmodeling results in very high abundances. Since the detectable CO2 and H2Obands overlap, separate bands need to be observed to prove their existence inthe atmosphere. In order to detect H2O in a separate band, a S/N>7 needs to beachieved for E-ELT observations, e.g. by co-adding at least 10 transitobservations. Using a spaceborne telescope like the JWST enables the detectionof CO2 at 4.3mu, which is not possible for ground-based observations due to theEarth's atmospheric absorption. Hence combining observations of spaceborne andgroundbased telescopes might allow to detect the presence of the biomarkermolecule O3 and the related compounds H2O and CO2 in a planetary atmosphere.Other absorption bands using the JWST can only be detected for much higherS/Ns, which is not achievable by just co-adding transit observations since thiswould be far beyond the planned mission time of JWST.(abridged)

Universal Properties of Galactic Rotation Curves and a First Principles  Derivation of the Tully-Fisher Relation

  In a recent paper McGaugh, Lelli, and Schombert showed that in an empiricalplot of the observed centripetal accelerations in spiral galaxies against thosepredicted by the Newtonian gravity of the luminous matter in those galaxies thedata points occupied a remarkably narrow band. While one could summarize themean properties of the band by drawing a single mean curve through it, byfitting the band with the illustrative conformal gravity theory with fits thatfill out the width of the band we show here that the width of the band is justas physically significant. We show that at very low luminous Newtonianaccelerations the plot can become independent of the luminous Newtoniancontribution altogether, but still be non-trivial due to the contribution ofmatter outside of the galaxies (viz. the rest of the visible universe). Wepresent a new empirical plot of the difference between the observed centripetalaccelerations and the luminous Newtonian expectations as a function of distancefrom the centers of galaxies, and show that at distances greater than 10 kpcthe plot also occupies a remarkably narrow band, one even close to constant.Using the conformal gravity theory we provide a first principles derivation ofthe empirical Tully-Fisher relation.

Mapping polar atmospheric features on Titan with VIMS: from the  dissipation of the northern cloud to the onset of a southern polar vortex

  We have analyzed the complete archive of the Visual and Infrared MappingSpectrometer (VIMS) data in order to monitor and analyze the evolution of theclouds and haze coverage at both poles of Titan during the entire Cassinimission. Our objective is to give a cartographic synopsis from a VIMSperspective, to provide a global view of the seasonal evolution of Titan'satmosphere over the poles. We leave the detailed comparison with the ImagingScience Subsystem (ISS) and the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) datasets to further studies. We have computed global hyperspectral mosaics for eachof the 127 targeted flybys of Titan to produce synthetic color maps emphasizingthe main atmospheric features. The north pole appears fully covered by a hugecloud as soon as the first observations in 2004 and up to the equinox in 2009(Le Mou\'elic et al. 2012). The northern skies then became progressivelyclearer, after the circulation turnover in 2009, revealing the underlying lakesand seas to the optical instruments up to 2017. The reverse situation isobserved over the south pole, which was mostly clear of such a high obscuringcloud during the first years of the mission, but started to develop a polarcloud in 2012. This feature grew up month after month until the end of themission in 2017, with a poleward latitudinal extent of 75$^\circ$S in 2013 upto 58$^\circ$S in April 2017. Thanks to the spectral capabilities of VIMS, wehave detected HCN spectral signatures over the north pole in almost all flybysbetween 2004 and 2008. These HCN signatures started then to show up over thesouth pole in almost all flybys between 2012 and 2017, so perfectly matchingthe timing and spatial extent of the northern and southern polar atmosphericfeatures.

PTF11eon/SN2011dh: Discovery of a Type IIb Supernova From a Compact  Progenitor in the Nearby Galaxy M51

  On May 31, 2011 UT a supernova (SN) exploded in the nearby galaxy M51 (theWhirlpool Galaxy). We discovered this event using small telescopes equippedwith CCD cameras, as well as by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey, andrapidly confirmed it to be a Type II supernova. Our early light curve andspectroscopy indicates that PTF11eon resulted from the explosion of arelatively compact progenitor star as evidenced by the rapid shock-breakoutcooling seen in the light curve, the relatively low temperature in early-timespectra and the prompt appearance of low-ionization spectral features. Thespectra of PTF11eon are dominated by H lines out to day 10 after explosion, butinitial signs of He appear to be present. Assuming that He lines continue todevelop in the near future, this SN is likely a member of the cIIb (compactIIb; Chevalier and Soderberg 2010) class, with progenitor radius larger thanthat of SN 2008ax and smaller than the eIIb (extended IIb) SN 1993J progenitor.Our data imply that the object identified in pre-explosion Hubble SpaceTelescope images at the SN location is possibly a companion to the progenitoror a blended source, and not the progenitor star itself, as its radius (~10^13cm) would be highly inconsistent with constraints from our post-explosionphotometric and spectroscopic data.

The Nature of CO Emission From z~6 Quasars

  We investigate the nature of CO emission from z~6 quasars by combiningnon-LTE radiative transfer calculations with merger-driven models of z~6 quasarformation that arise naturally in LCDM cosmological simulations. We considerfour model quasars formed in 10^12-10^13 M_sun halos from different merginghistories. Our main results follow. Owing to massive starbursts and funnelingof dense gas into the nuclear regions of merging galaxies, the CO is highlyexcited and the flux density peaks between J=5-8. The CO morphology of z~6quasars often exhibits multiple emission peaks which arise from H2concentrations which have not yet fully coalesced. Quasars at z~6 display alarge range of sightline dependent line widths such that the lines arenarrowest when the rotating H2 gas associated with the quasar is viewed face-on(when L_B is largest), and broadest when the gas is seen edge-on (when L_B islowest). Thus for all models selection effects exist such that quasars selectedfor optical luminosity are preferentially face-on which may result in detectedCO line widths narrower than the median. The sightline averaged line width isreflective of the circular velocity (V_c) of the host halo, and ranges fromsigma~300-650 km/s. For optically selected QSOs, 10-25% (halo-mass dependant)of sightlines have narrow line widths compatible with the sole CO detection atz>6, J1148+5251. When accounting for both the temporal evolution of CO linewidths, as well as the redshift evolution of halo V_c, these modelsself-consistently account for the CO line widths of both z~2 sub-mm galaxiesand QSO's. Finally, the dynamical mass derived from the sightline averaged linewidths provides a good estimate of the total mass, and allows for a stellarbulge and SMBH consistent with the local M_BH-M_bulge relation.

Young stellar clusters and star formation throughout the Galaxy

  Most stars are born in rich young stellar clusters (YSCs) embedded in giantmolecular clouds. The most massive stars live out their short lives there,profoundly influencing their natal environments by ionizing HII regions,inflating wind-blown bubbles, and soon exploding as supernovae. Thousands oflower-mass pre-main sequence stars accompany the massive stars, and theexpanding HII regions paradoxically trigger new star formation as they destroytheir natal clouds. While this schematic picture is established, ourunderstanding of the complex astrophysical processes involved in clustered starformation have only just begun to be elucidated. The technologies arechallenging, requiring both high spatial resolution and wide fields atwavelengths that penetrate obscuring molecular material and removecontaminating Galactic field stars. We outline several important projects forthe coming decade: the IMFs and structures of YSCs; triggered star formationaround YSC; the fate of OB winds; the stellar populations of Infrared DarkClouds; the most massive star clusters in the Galaxy; tracing star formationthroughout the Galactic Disk; the Galactic Center region and YSCs in theMagellanic Clouds. Programmatic recommendations include: developing a 30m-classadaptive optics infrared telescope; support for high-resolution and wide fieldX-ray telescopes; large-aperture sub-millimeter and far-infrared telescopes;multi-object infrared spectrographs; and both numerical and analytical theory.
