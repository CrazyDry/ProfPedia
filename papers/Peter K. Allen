Maximum planar subgraphs in dense graphs

  K\"uhn, Osthus and Taraz showed that for each \gamma>0 there exists C such
that any n-vertex graph with minimum degree \gamma n contains a planar subgraph
with at least 2n-C edges. We find the optimum value of C for all \gamma<1/2 and
sufficiently large n.


The Allen Telescope Array Commensal Observing System

  This memo describes the system used to conduct commensal correlator and
beamformer observations at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). This system was
deployed for ~2 years until the ATA hibernation in 2011 and was responsible for
collecting >5 TB of data during thousands of hours of observations. The general
system design is presented and the implementation is discussed in detail. I
emphasize the rationale for various design decisions and attempt to document a
few aspects of ATA operations that might not be obvious to non-insiders. I
close with some recommendations from my experience developing the software
infrastructure and managing the correlator observations. These include: reuse
existing systems; solve, don't avoid, tensions between projects, and share
infrastructure; plan to make standalone observations to complement the
commensal ones; and be considerate of observatory staff when deploying new and
unusual observing modes. The structure of the software codebase is documented.


The Bandwidth Theorem in sparse graphs

  The bandwidth theorem [Mathematische Annalen, 343(1):175--205, 2009] states
that any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree
$\big(\tfrac{k-1}{k}+o(1)\big)n$ contains all $n$-vertex $k$-colourable graphs
$H$ with bounded maximum degree and bandwidth $o(n)$. We provide sparse
analogues of this statement in random graphs as well as pseudorandom graphs.
  More precisely, we show that for $p\gg \big(\tfrac{\log
n}{n}\big)^{1/\Delta}$ a.a.s. each spanning subgraph $G$ of $G(n,p)$ with
minimum degree $\big(\tfrac{k-1}{k}+o(1)\big)pn$ contains all $n$-vertex
$k$-colourable graphs $H$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, bandwidth $o(n)$, and
at least $C p^{-2}$ vertices not contained in any triangle. A similar result is
shown for sufficiently bijumbled graphs, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first resilience result in pseudorandom graphs for a rich class of
subgraphs. Finally, we provide improved results for $H$ with small degeneracy,
which in particular imply a resilience result in $G(n,p)$ with respect to the
containment of spanning bounded degree trees for $p\gg \big(\tfrac{\log
n}{n}\big)^{1/3}$.


A New Brown Dwarf Desert? A Scarcity of Wide Ultracool Binaries

  We present the results of a deep-imaging search for wide companions to
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs using NSFCam on IRTF. We searched a sample of
132 M7-L8 dwarfs to magnitude limits of $J \sim 20.5$ and $K \sim 18.5$,
corresponding to secondary-primary mass ratios of $\sim 0.5$. No companions
were found with separations between $2{\arcsec}$ to $31{\arcsec}$ ($\sim$40 AU
to $\sim$1000 AU). This null result implies a wide companion frequency below
2.3% at the 95% confidence level within the sensitivity limits of the survey.
Preliminary modeling efforts indicate that we could have detected 85% of
companions more massive than $0.05 M_{\odot}$ and 50% above $0.03 M_{\odot}$.


Powers of Hamilton cycles in pseudorandom graphs

  We study the appearance of powers of Hamilton cycles in pseudorandom graphs,
using the following comparatively weak pseudorandomness notion. A graph $G$ is
$(\varepsilon,p,k,\ell)$-pseudorandom if for all disjoint $X$ and $Y\subset
V(G)$ with $|X|\ge\varepsilon p^kn$ and $|Y|\ge\varepsilon p^\ell n$ we have
$e(X,Y)=(1\pm\varepsilon)p|X||Y|$. We prove that for all $\beta>0$ there is an
$\varepsilon>0$ such that an $(\varepsilon,p,1,2)$-pseudorandom graph on $n$
vertices with minimum degree at least $\beta pn$ contains the square of a
Hamilton cycle. In particular, this implies that $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs with
$\lambda\ll d^{5/2 }n^{-3/2}$ contain the square of a Hamilton cycle, and thus
a triangle factor if $n$ is a multiple of $3$. This improves on a result of
Krivelevich, Sudakov and Szab\'o [Triangle factors in sparse pseudo-random
graphs, Combinatorica 24 (2004), no. 3, 403--426].
  We also extend our result to higher powers of Hamilton cycles and establish
corresponding counting versions.


New Low-Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs with Disks in Lupus

  Using the Infrared Array Camera and the Multiband Imaging Photometer aboard
the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope}, we have obtained images of the Lupus 3
star-forming cloud at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 \micron. We present photometry
in these bands for the 41 previously known members that are within our images.
In addition, we have identified 19 possible new members of the cloud based on
red 3.6-8.0 \micron colors that are indicative of circumstellar disks. We have
performed optical spectroscopy on 6 of these candidates, all of which are
confirmed as young low-mass members of Lupus 3. The spectral types of these new
members range from M4.75 to M8, corresponding to masses of 0.2-0.03 $M_\odot$
for ages of $\sim1$ Myr according to theoretical evolutionary models. We also
present optical spectroscopy of a candidate disk-bearing object in the vicinity
of the Lupus 1 cloud, 2M 1541-3345, which Jayawardhana & Ivanov recently
classified as a young brown dwarf ($M\sim0.03$ $M_\odot$) with a spectral type
of M8. In contrast to their results, we measure an earlier spectral type of
M5.75$\pm$0.25 for this object, indicating that it is probably a low-mass star
($M\sim0.1$ $M_\odot$). In fact, according to its gravity-sensitive absorption
lines and its luminosity, 2M 1541-3345 is older than members of the Lupus
clouds ($\tau\sim1$ Myr) and instead is probably a more evolved
pre-main-sequence star that is not directly related to the current generation
of star formation in Lupus.


A density CorrÃ¡di-Hajnal Theorem

  We find, for all sufficiently large $n$ and each $k$, the maximum number of
edges in an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain $k+1$ vertex-disjoint
triangles.
  This extends a result of Moon [Canad. J. Math. 20 (1968), 96-102] which is in
turn an extension of Mantel's Theorem. Our result can also be viewed as a
density version of the Corradi-Hajnal Theorem.


Low-Mass Tertiary Companions to Spectroscopic Binaries I: Common Proper
  Motion Survey for Wide Companions using 2MASS

  We report the first results of a multi-epoch search for wide (separations
greater than a few tens of AU), low-mass tertiary companions of a
volume-limited sample of 118 known spectroscopic binaries within 30 pc of the
Sun, using the 2MASS Point Source Catalog and follow-up observations with the
KPNO and CTIO 4m telescopes. Note that this sample is not volume-complete but
volume-limited, and, thus, there is incompleteness in our reported companion
rates. We are sensitive to common proper motion companions with separations
from roughly 200 AU to 10,000 AU (~10" -> ~10'). From 77 sources followed-up to
date, we recover 11 previously known tertiaries, three previously known
candidate tertiaries, of which two are spectroscopically confirmed and one
rejected, and three new candidates, of which two are confirmed and one
rejected. This yields an estimated wide tertiary fraction of 19.5^+5.2%_-3.7%.
This observed fraction is consistent with predictions set out in star formation
simulations where the fraction of wide, low-mass companions to spectroscopic
binaries is >10%, and is roughly twice the wide companion rate of single stars.


Evaluating the Calorimeter Model with Broadband, Continuous Spectra of
  Starburst Galaxies Observed with the Allen Telescope Array

  Although the relationship between the far-infrared and cm-wave radio
luminosities of normal galaxies is one of the most striking correlations in
astronomy, a solid understanding of its physical basis is lacking. In one
interpretation, the "calorimeter model," rapid synchrotron cooling of cosmic
ray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship.
Observed radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooled
synchrotron emission. In Thompson et al. (2006), a simple parameterized model
is presented to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might arise
even in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionization
losses and other cooling mechanisms. During the commissioning of the 42-element
Allen Telescope Array, we observed the starburst galaxies M82, NGC 253, and Arp
220 at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7 GHz, obtaining unprecedented broadband
continuous radio spectra of these sources. We combine our observations with
high-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermal
and nonthermal components. The nonthermal components all steepen in the cm-wave
regime and cannot be well-modeled as simple power laws. The model of Thompson
et al. is consistent with our M82 results when plausible parameters are chosen,
and our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed model
parameters. The model is only marginally consistent with our NGC 253 data.
Assuming the Thompson et al. model, a steep electron energy injection index of
p = -2.5 is ruled out in M82 and NGC 253 to >99% confidence. We describe in
detail the observing procedures, calibration methods, analysis, and consistency
checks used for broadband spectral observations with the Allen Telescope Array.


Commensal observing with the Allen Telescope array: software command and
  control

  The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a Large-Number-Small-Diameter radio
telescope array currently with 42 individual antennas and 5 independent
back-end science systems (2 imaging FX correlators and 3 time domain beam
formers) located at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCRO). The goal of the ATA
is to run multiple back-ends simultaneously, supporting multiple science
projects commensally. The primary software control systems are based on a
combination of Java, JRuby and Ruby on Rails. The primary control API is
simplified to provide easy integration with new back-end systems while the
lower layers of the software stack are handled by a master observing system.
Scheduling observations for the ATA is based on finding a union between the
science needs of multiple projects and automatically determining an efficient
path to operating the various sub-components to meet those needs. When
completed, the ATA is expected to be a world-class radio telescope, combining
dedicated SETI projects with numerous radio astronomy science projects.


The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes, I. HI Observations of Edge-on Galaxies

  We present neutral hydrogen observations for a sample of eight nearby,
late-type, edge-on galaxies. All of the galaxies have been well resolved in the
radial direction, while six have also been well resolved in the vertical
direction. We find that each of the galaxies has approximately the same maximum
surface brightness temperature throughout its disc. We argue that
self-absorption is the main cause of this phenomenon and that subsequent
decompositions will require a treatment of this.


Turan numbers for bipartite graphs plus an odd cycle

  For an odd integer $k$, let $\mathcal{C}_k = \{C_3,C_5,...,C_k\}$ denote the
family of all odd cycles of length at most $k$ and let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the
family of all odd cycles. Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits \cite{ESi1} conjectured that
for every family $\mathcal{F}$ of bipartite graphs, there exists $k$ such that
$\ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}_k} \sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup
\mathcal{C}}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. This conjecture was proved by
Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits when $\mathcal{F} = \{C_4\}$, and for certain families
of even cycles in \cite{KSV}. In this paper, we give a general approach to the
conjecture using Scott's sparse regularity lemma. Our approach proves the
conjecture for complete bipartite graphs $K_{2,t}$ and $K_{3,3}$: we obtain
more strongly that for any odd $k \geq 5$, \[ \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \{C_k\}}
\sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}}\] and we show further that the
extremal graphs can be made bipartite by deleting very few edges. In contrast,
this formula does not extend to triangles -- the case $k = 3$ -- and we give an
algebraic construction for odd $t \geq 3$ of $K_{2,t}$-free $C_3$-free graphs
with substantially more edges than an extremal $K_{2,t}$-free bipartite graph
on $n$ vertices. Our general approach to the Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits conjecture is
effective based on some reasonable assumptions on the maximum number of edges
in an $m$ by $n$ bipartite $\mathcal{F}$-free graph.


Luminosity Functions of Young Clusters: Modeling the Substellar Mass
  Regime

  We predict near-infrared luminosity functions of young (5 Myr to 1 Gyr) star
clusters by combining evolutionary models of very low-mass ($1 M_J$ to $0.15
M_{\odot}$) dwarfs with empirical bolometric corrections. We identify several
characteristic features in our results. These can be attributed to three
causes: (1) deuterium burning in the most massive substellar objects; (2)
methane absorption in bodies with $T_{eff}$ less than 1300 K, the temperature
of the L/T transition; and (3) the formation of dust clouds and the rainout of
dust at roughly the same effective temperature as methane formation. Accurate
reconstruction of the substellar mass function from luminosity function
observations requires that these phenomena are taken into account. At present,
few observational studies extend to sufficient sensitivities to allow detection
of these effects. However, the luminosity function of the young open cluster IC
2391 shows a clear peak at $M_I \sim 14$ which we attribute to the result of
deuterium burning in substellar objects. The location of this feature is a
strong function of age, and we estimate an age of 35 Myr for IC 2391. This is
significantly younger than the 53 Myr derived from the location of the lithium
depletion boundary but agrees with the main sequence turnoff age. We consider
the implications of this result and our multi-band luminosity functions for
future observational studies. All predicted luminosity function features are,
or will be, accessible to observations using new wide-field IR imagers and the
Space Infrared Telescope Facility.


Tight cycles and regular slices in dense hypergraphs

  We study properties of random subcomplexes of partitions returned by (a
suitable form of) the Strong Hypergraph Regularity Lemma, which we call regular
slices. We argue that these subcomplexes capture many important structural
properties of the original hypergraph. Accordingly we advocate their use in
extremal hypergraph theory, and explain how they can lead to considerable
simplifications in existing proofs in this field. We also use them for
establishing the following two new results.
  Firstly, we prove a hypergraph extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem: for
every $\delta>0$ every sufficiently large $k$-uniform hypergraph with at least
$(\alpha+\delta)\binom{n}{k}$ edges contains a tight cycle of length $\alpha n$
for each $\alpha\in[0,1]$.
  Secondly, we find (asymptotically) the minimum codegree requirement for a
$k$-uniform $k$-partite hypergraph, each of whose parts has $n$ vertices, to
contain a tight cycle of length $\alpha kn$, for each $0<\alpha<1$.


Two-Point Green's Function in PT-Symmetric Theories

  The Hamiltonian $H={1\over2} p^2+{1\over2}m^2x^2+gx^2(ix)^\delta$ with
$\delta,g\geq0$ is non-Hermitian, but the energy levels are real and positive
as a consequence of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry. The quantum mechanical theory
described by $H$ is treated as a one-dimensional Euclidean quantum field
theory. The two-point Green's function for this theory is investigated using
perturbative and numerical techniques. The K\"allen-Lehmann representation for
the Green's function is constructed, and it is shown that by virtue of ${\cal
PT}$ symmetry the Green's function is entirely real. While the wave-function
renormalization constant $Z$ cannot be interpreted as a conventional
probability, it still obeys a normalization determined by the commutation
relations of the field. This provides strong evidence that the eigenfunctions
of the Hamiltonian are complete.


The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes II. The Galactus HI Modelling & Fitting
  Tool

  We present a new HI modelling tool called \textsc{Galactus}. The program has
been designed to perform automated fits of disc-galaxy models to observations.
It includes a treatment for the self-absorption of the gas. The software has
been released into the public domain. We describe the design philosophy and
inner workings of the program. After this, we model the face-on galaxy NGC2403,
using both self-absorption and optically thin models, showing that
self-absorption occurs even in face-on galaxies. It is shown that the maximum
surface brightness plateaus seen in Paper I of this series are indeed signs of
self-absorption. The apparent HI mass of an edge-on galaxy can be drastically
lower compared to that same galaxy seen face-on. The Tully-Fisher relation is
found to be relatively free from self-absorption issues.


The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes III. Kinematics and Structure of the HI
  disc

  We present a new strategy for fitting the structure and kinematics of the HI
in edge-on galaxies using a fit to the terminal-velocity channel maps of a HI
data cube. The strategy can deal with self-absorbing HI gas and the presence of
warps. The method is first tested on a series of models. We demonstrate that
fitting optically thin models to real galaxies will lead to an overestimation
of the thickness and velocity dispersion, and to a serious underestimation of
the HI face-on column densities. We subsequently fit both self-absorption and
optically thin models to the HI data of six edge-on galaxies. In three of these
we have also measured the velocity dispersion. On average 27 \pm 6 % of the
total HI mass of edge-on galaxies is hidden by self-absorption. This implies
that the HI mass, thickness and velocity dispersion of galaxies is typically
underestimated in the literature.


Workspace Aware Online Grasp Planning

  This work provides a framework for a workspace aware online grasp planner.
This framework greatly improves the performance of standard online grasp
planning algorithms by incorporating a notion of reachability into the online
grasp planning process. Offline, a database of hundreds of thousands of unique
end-effector poses were queried for feasability. At runtime, our grasp planner
uses this database to bias the hand towards reachable end-effector
configurations.
  The bias keeps the grasp planner in accessible regions of the planning scene
so that the resulting grasps are tailored to the situation at hand. This
results in a higher percentage of reachable grasps, a higher percentage of
successful grasp executions, and a reduced planning time. We also present
experimental results using simulated and real environments.


Greedy low-rank algorithm for spatial connectome regression

  We study a smooth matrix regression problem formulated to recover brain
connectivity from data. The problem is set up as a general algebraic linear
matrix equation of high dimension, and the desired solution is approximated by
a low-rank factorization. This factorization is computed iteratively by an
efficient greedy low-rank algorithm that exploits important properties of the
original matrix equation, such as sparsity and positive definiteness. The
performance of the method is evaluated on three test cases: a toy artificial
dataset and two cortical problems employing data from the Allen Mouse Brain
Connectivity Atlas. We find numerically that the method is significantly faster
than previous gradient-based methods and converges to the full rank solution as
the rank increases. This speedup allows for the estimation of increasingly
large-scale connectomes as these data become available from tracing
experiments.


Pixel-Attentive Policy Gradient for Multi-Fingered Grasping in Cluttered
  Scenes

  Recent advances in on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods enabled
learning agents in virtual environments to master complex tasks with
high-dimensional and continuous observation and action spaces. However,
leveraging this family of algorithms in multi-fingered robotic grasping remains
a challenge due to large sim-to-real fidelity gaps and the high sample
complexity of on-policy RL algorithms. This work aims to bridge these gaps by
first reinforcement-learning a multi-fingered robotic grasping policy in
simulation that operates in the pixel space of the input: a single depth image.
Using a mapping from pixel space to Cartesian space according to the depth map,
this method transfers to the real world with high fidelity and introduces a
novel attention mechanism that substantially improves grasp success rate in
cluttered environments. Finally, the direct-generative nature of this method
allows learning of multi-fingered grasps that have flexible end-effector
positions, orientations and rotations, as well as all degrees of freedom of the
hand.


The Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey -- A
  700-Square-Degree, Multi-Epoch Radio Dataset -- II: Individual Epoch
  Transient Statistics

  We present our second paper on the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter
Survey (ATATS), a multi-epoch, ~700 sq. deg. radio image and catalog at 1.4
GHz. The survey is designed to detect rare, bright transients as well as to
commission the ATA's wide-field survey capabilities. ATATS explores the
challenges of multi-epoch transient and variable source surveys in the domain
of dynamic range limits and changing (u,v) coverage.
  Here we present images made using data from the individual epochs, as well as
a revised image combining data from all ATATS epochs. The combined image has
RMS noise 3.96 mJy / beam, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. The
catalog, generated using a false detection rate algorithm, contains 4984
sources, and is >90% complete to 37.9 mJy. The catalogs generated from snapshot
images of the individual epochs contain between 1170 and 2019 sources over the
564 sq. deg. area in common to all epochs. The 90% completeness limits of the
single epoch catalogs range from 98.6 to 232 mJy.
  We compare the catalog generated from the combined image to those from
individual epochs, and from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), a legacy survey at
the same frequency. We are able to place new constraints on the transient
population: fewer than 6e-4 transients / sq. deg., for transients brighter than
350 mJy with characteristic timescales of minutes to days. This strongly rules
out an astronomical origin for the ~1 Jy sources reported by Matsumura et al.
(2009), based on their stated rate of 3.1e-3 / sq. deg.


The Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey - A
  690-Square-Degree, 12-Epoch Radio Dataset - I: Catalog and Long-Duration
  Transient Statistics

  We present the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey (ATATS), a
multi-epoch (12 visits), 690 square degree radio image and catalog at 1.4GHz.
The survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as to
verify the capabilities of the ATA to form large mosaics. The combined image
using data from all 12 ATATS epochs has RMS noise sigma = 3.94mJy / beam and
dynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. It contains 4408
sources to a limiting sensitivity of S = 20 mJy / beam. We compare the catalog
generated from this 12-epoch combined image to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS),
a legacy survey at the same frequency, and find that we can measure source
positions to better than ~20 arcsec. For sources above the ATATS completeness
limit, the median flux density is 97% of the median value for matched NVSS
sources, indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration. We examine the
effects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution between
ATATS and NVSS on our ability to compare flux densities. We detect no
transients at flux densities greater than 40 mJy in comparison with NVSS, and
place a 2-sigma upper limit on the transient rate for such sources of 0.004 per
square degree. These results suggest that the > 1 Jy transients reported by
Matsumura et al. (2009) may not be true transients, but rather variable sources
at their flux density threshold.


The Allen Telescope Array Pi GHz Sky Survey I. Survey Description and
  Static Catalog Results for the Bootes Field

  The Pi GHz Sky Survey (PiGSS) is a key project of the Allen Telescope Array.
PiGSS is a 3.1 GHz survey of radio continuum emission in the extragalactic sky
with an emphasis on synoptic observations that measure the static and
time-variable properties of the sky. During the 2.5-year campaign, PiGSS will
twice observe ~250,000 radio sources in the 10,000 deg^2 region of the sky with
b > 30 deg to an rms sensitivity of ~1 mJy. Additionally, sub-regions of the
sky will be observed multiple times to characterize variability on time scales
of days to years. We present here observations of a 10 deg^2 region in the
Bootes constellation overlapping the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey field. The
PiGSS image was constructed from 75 daily observations distributed over a
4-month period and has an rms flux density between 200 and 250 microJy. This
represents a deeper image by a factor of 4 to 8 than we will achieve over the
entire 10,000 deg^2. We provide flux densities, source sizes, and spectral
indices for the 425 sources detected in the image. We identify ~100$ new flat
spectrum radio sources; we project that when completed PiGSS will identify 10^4
flat spectrum sources. We identify one source that is a possible transient
radio source. This survey provides new limits on faint radio transients and
variables with characteristic durations of months.


Primary Beam and Dish Surface Characterization at the Allen Telescope
  Array by Radio Holography

  The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a cm-wave interferometer in California,
comprising 42 antenna elements with 6-m diameter dishes. We characterize the
antenna optical accuracy using two-antenna interferometry and radio holography.
The distortion of each telescope relative to the average is small, with RMS
differences of 1 percent of beam peak value. Holography provides images of dish
illumination pattern, allowing characterization of as-built mirror surfaces.
The ATA dishes can experience mm-scale distortions across -2 meter lengths due
to mounting stresses or solar radiation. Experimental RMS errors are 0.7 mm at
night and 3 mm under worst case solar illumination. For frequencies 4, 10, and
15 GHz, the nighttime values indicate sensitivity losses of 1, 10 and 20
percent, respectively. The ATA.s exceptional wide-bandwidth permits
observations over a continuous range 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, and future retrofits may
increase this range to 15 GHz. Beam patterns show a slowly varying focus
frequency dependence. We probe the antenna optical gain and beam pattern
stability as a function of focus and observation frequency, concluding that ATA
can produce high fidelity images over a decade of simultaneous observation
frequencies. In the day, the antenna sensitivity and pointing accuracy are
affected. We find that at frequencies greater than 5 GHz, daytime observations
greater than 5 GHz will suffer some sensitivity loss and it may be necessary to
make antenna pointing corrections on a 1 to 2 hourly basis.


ASGARD: A Large Survey for Slow Galactic Radio Transients. I. Overview
  and First Results

  Searches for slow radio transients and variables have generally focused on
extragalactic populations, and the basic parameters of Galactic populations
remain poorly characterized. We present a large 3 GHz survey performed with the
Allen Telescope Array (ATA) that aims to improve this situation: ASGARD, the
ATA Survey of Galactic Radio Dynamism. ASGARD observations spanned 2 years with
weekly visits to 23 deg^2 in two fields in the Galactic Plane, totaling 900 hr
of integration time on science fields and making it significantly larger than
previous efforts. The typical blind unresolved source detection limit was 10
mJy. We describe the observations and data analysis techniques in detail,
demonstrating our ability to create accurate wide-field images while
effectively modeling and subtracting large-scale radio emission, allowing
standard transient-and-variability analysis techniques to be used. We present
early results from the analysis of two pointings: one centered on the
microquasar Cygnus X-3 and one overlapping the Kepler field of view (l =
76{\deg}, b = +13.5{\deg}). Our results include images, catalog statistics,
completeness functions, variability measurements, and a transient search. Out
of 134 sources detected in these pointings, the only compellingly variable one
is Cygnus X-3, and no transients are detected. We estimate number counts for
potential Galactic radio transients and compare our current limits to previous
work and our projection for the fully-analyzed ASGARD dataset.


Grains in Photo-Ionized Environments

  Ever since the pioneering study of Spitzer, it has been widely recognized
that grains play an important role in the heating and cooling of photo-ionized
environments. This includes the diffuse ISM, as well as H II regions, planetary
nebulae, and photo-dissociation regions.
  A detailed code is necessary to model grains in a photo-ionized medium since
the interactions of grains with their environment include a host of
microphysical processes, and their importance can only be judged by performing
a complete simulation. In this paper we will use the spectral synthesis code
Cloudy for this purpose. A comprehensive upgrade of the grain model has been
recently incorporated in Cloudy, and certain aspects of this upgrade will be
discussed. Special emphasis will be on the new grain charge model. We will
consider in detail the physics of grains in both ionized and neutral
environments, and will present a calculation of photo-electric heating and
collisional cooling rates for a range of physical conditions and grain
materials and for a range of grain sizes (including a realistic size
distribution). We conclude with a brief discussion of the problems currently
hampering progress in this field. The new grain model will be used to model the
silicate emission in the Ney-Allen nebula, and will help us better understand
the nature of the grains in that part of the Orion complex.


The Spitzer c2d survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds. V.
  Chamaeleon II Observed with IRAC

  We present IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron) observations of the
Chamaeleon II molecular cloud. The observed area covers about 1 square degree
defined by $A_V >2$. Analysis of the data in the 2005 c2d catalogs reveals a
small number of sources (40) with properties similar to those of young
stellaror substellar objects (YSOs). The surface density of these YSO
candidates is low, and contamination by background galaxies appears to be
substantial, especially for sources classified as Class I or flat SED. We
discuss this problem in some detail and conclude that very few of the candidate
YSOs in early evolutionary stages are actually in the Cha II cloud. Using a
refined set of criteria, we define a smaller, but more reliable, set of 24 YSO
candidates.


The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes, V. Analysis of observations of edge-on
  galaxies

  In the previous papers in this series, we have measured the stellar and \hi
content in a sample of edge-on galaxies. In the present paper, we perform a
simultaneous rotation curve and vertical force field gradient decomposition for
five of these edge-on galaxies. The rotation curve decomposition provides a
measure of the radial dark matter potential, while the vertical force field
gradient provide a measure of the vertical dark matter potential. We fit dark
matter halo models to these potentials. Using our \hi self-absorption results,
we find that a typical dark matter halo has a less dense core
($0.094\pm0.230$\,M$_\odot$/pc$^3$) compared to an optically thin \hi model
($0.150\pm0.124$\,M$_\odot$/pc$^3$). The HI self-absorption dark matter halo
has a longer scale length $R_c$ of $1.42\pm 3.48$\,kpc, versus $1.10\pm
1.81$\,kpc for the optically thin HI model. The median halo shape is spherical,
at $q=1.0\pm0.6$ (self-absorbing \hi), while it is prolate at $q=1.5\pm0.6$ for
the optically thin. Our best results were obtained for ESO\,274-G001 and
UGC\,7321, for which we were able to measure the velocity dispersion in Paper
III. These two galaxies have drastically different halo shapes, with one oblate
and one strongly prolate. Overall, we find that the many assumptions required
make this type of analysis susceptible to errors.


Analysis of large-scale anisotropy of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in
  HiRes data

  Stereo data collected by the HiRes experiment over a six year period are
examined for large-scale anisotropy related to the inhomogeneous distribution
of matter in the nearby Universe. We consider the generic case of small
cosmic-ray deflections and a large number of sources tracing the matter
distribution. In this matter tracer model the expected cosmic ray flux depends
essentially on a single free parameter, the typical deflection angle theta. We
find that the HiRes data with threshold energies of 40 EeV and 57 EeV are
incompatible with the matter tracer model at a 95% confidence level unless
theta is larger than 10 degrees and are compatible with an isotropic flux. The
data set above 10 EeV is compatible with both the matter tracer model and an
isotropic flux.


The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds: VII.
  Ophiuchus Observed with MIPS

  We present maps of 14.4 deg^2 of the Ophiuchus dark clouds observed by the
Spitzer Space Telescope Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). These
high quality maps depict both numerous point sources as well as extended dust
emission within the star-forming and non-star-forming portions of these clouds.
Using PSF-fitting photometry, we detect 5779 sources at 24 um and 81 sources at
70 um at the 10 sigma level of significance. Three hundred twenty-three
candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) were identified according to their
positions on the MIPS/2MASS K versus K$-$[24] color-magnitude diagrams as
compared to 24 um detections in the SWIRE extragalactic survey. We find that
more than half of the YSO candidates, and almost all the ones with protostellar
Class I spectral energy distributions, are confined to the known cluster and
aggregates.


Development of the (d,n) proton-transfer reaction in inverse kinematics
  for structure studies

  Transfer reactions have provided exciting opportunities to study the
structure of exotic nuclei and are often used to inform studies relating to
nucleosynthesis and applications. In order to benefit from these reactions and
their application to rare ion beams (RIBs) it is necessary to develop the tools
and techniques to perform and analyze the data from reactions performed in
inverse kinematics, that is with targets of light nuclei and heavier beams. We
are continuing to expand the transfer reaction toolbox in preparation for the
next generation of facilities, such as the Facility for Rare Ion Beams (FRIB),
which is scheduled for completion in 2022. An important step in this process is
to perform the (d,n) reaction in inverse kinematics, with analyses that include
Q-value spectra and differential cross sections. In this way, proton-transfer
reactions can be placed on the same level as the more commonly used
neutron-transfer reactions, such as (d,p), (9Be,8Be), and (13C,12C). Here we
present an overview of the techniques used in (d,p) and (d,n), and some recent
data from (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics using stable beams of 12C and
16O.


The 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (2SLAQ) Luminous Red Galaxy Survey

  We present a spectroscopic survey of almost 15,000 candidate
intermediate-redshift Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) brighter than i=19.8,
observed with 2dF on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The targets were selected
photometrically from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and lie along two
narrow equatorial strips covering 180 sq deg. Reliable redshifts were obtained
for 92% of the targets and the selection is very efficient: over 90% have
redshifts between 0.45 and 0.8. More than 80% of the ~11,000 red galaxies have
pure absorption-line spectra consistent with a passively-evolving old stellar
population. The redshift, photometric and spatial distributions of the LRGs are
described. The 2SLAQ data will be released publicly from mid-2006, providing a
powerful resource for observational cosmology and the study of galaxy
evolution.


Mass Transport Processes and their Roles in the Formation, Structure,
  and Evolution of Stars and Stellar Systems

  We summarize some of the compelling new scientific opportunities for
understanding stars and stellar systems that can be enabled by sub-mas angular
resolution, UV/Optical spectral imaging observations, which can reveal the
details of the many dynamic processes (e.g., variable magnetic fields,
accretion, convection, shocks, pulsations, winds, and jets) that affect their
formation, structure, and evolution. These observations can only be provided by
long-baseline interferometers or sparse aperture telescopes in space, since the
aperture diameters required are in excess of 500 m - a regime in which
monolithic or segmented designs are not and will not be feasible - and since
they require observations at wavelengths (UV) not accessible from the ground.
Two mission concepts which could provide these invaluable observations are
NASA's Stellar Imager (SI; http://hires.gsfc.nasa.gov/si/) interferometer and
ESA's Luciola sparse aperture hypertelescope, which each could resolve hundreds
of stars and stellar systems. These observatories will also open an immense new
discovery space for astrophysical research in general and, in particular, for
Active Galactic Nuclei (Kraemer et al. Decadal Survey Science Whitepaper). The
technology developments needed for these missions are challenging, but
eminently feasible (Carpenter et al. Decadal Survey Technology Whitepaper) with
a reasonable investment over the next decade to enable flight in the 2025+
timeframe. That investment would enable tremendous gains in our understanding
of the individual stars and stellar systems that are the building blocks of our
Universe and which serve as the hosts for life throughout the Cosmos.


Overview of the Kepler Science Processing Pipeline

  The Kepler Mission Science Operations Center (SOC) performs several critical
functions including managing the ~156,000 target stars, associated target
tables, science data compression tables and parameters, as well as processing
the raw photometric data downlinked from the spacecraft each month. The raw
data are first calibrated at the pixel level to correct for bias, smear induced
by a shutterless readout, and other detector and electronic effects. A
background sky flux is estimated from ~4500 pixels on each of the 84 CCD
readout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimal
aperture for each star. Ancillary engineering data and diagnostic information
extracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in the
flux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching for
signatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter.
Stars with signatures exceeding 7.1 sigma are subjected to a suite of
statistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion to
reject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. Physical
parameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature,
and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residual
light curve. The pipeline is operational, finding planetary signatures and
providing robust eliminations of false positives.


Primary Beam Shape Calibration from Mosaicked, Interferometric
  Observations

  Image quality in mosaicked observations from interferometric radio telescopes
is strongly dependent on the accuracy with which the antenna primary beam is
calibrated. The next generation of radio telescope arrays such as the Allen
Telescope Array (ATA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) have key science
goals that involve making large mosaicked observations filled with bright point
sources. We present a new method for calibrating the shape of the telescope's
mean primary beam that uses the multiple redundant observations of these bright
sources in the mosaic. The method has an analytical solution for simple
Gaussian beam shapes but can also be applied to more complex beam shapes
through $\chi^2$ minimization. One major benefit of this simple, conceptually
clean method is that it makes use of the science data for calibration purposes,
thus saving telescope time and improving accuracy through simultaneous
calibration and observation. We apply the method both to 1.43 GHz data taken
during the ATA Twenty Centimeter Survey (ATATS) and to 3.14 GHz data taken
during the ATA's Pi Gigahertz Sky Survey (PiGSS). We find that the beam's
calculated full width at half maximum (FWHM) values are consistent with the
theoretical values, the values measured by several independent methods, and the
values from the simulation we use to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on data from future telescopes such as the expanded ATA and the SKA.
These results are preliminary, and can be expanded upon by fitting more complex
beam shapes. We also investigate, by way of a simulation, the dependence of the
accuracy of the telescope's FWHM on antenna number. We find that the
uncertainty returned by our fitting method is inversely proportional to the
number of antennas in the array.


Ramsey-goodness -- and otherwise

  A celebrated result of Chv\'atal, R\"odl, Szemer\'edi and Trotter states (in
slightly weakened form) that, for every natural number $\Delta$, there is a
constant $r_\Delta$ such that, for any connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with
maximum degree $\Delta$, the Ramsey number $R(G,G)$ is at most $r_\Delta n$,
provided $n$ is sufficiently large. In 1987, Burr made a strong conjecture
implying that one may take $r_\Delta = \Delta$. However, Graham, R\"odl and
Ruci\'nski showed, by taking $G$ to be a suitable expander graph, that
necessarily $r_\Delta > 2^{c\Delta}$ for some constant $c>0$. We show that the
use of expanders is essential: if we impose the additional restriction that the
bandwidth of $G$ be at most some function $\beta (n) = o(n)$, then $R(G,G) \le
(2\chi(G)+4)n\leq (2\Delta+6)n$, i.e., $r_\Delta = 2\Delta +6$ suffices. On the
other hand, we show that Burr's conjecture itself fails even for $P_n^k$, the
$k$th power of a path $P_n$. Brandt showed that for any $c$, if $\Delta$ is
sufficiently large, there are connected $n$-vertex graphs $G$ with
$\Delta(G)\leq\Delta$ but $R(G,K_3)>cn$. We show that, given $\Delta$ and $H$,
there are $\beta>0$ and $n_0$ such that, if $G$ is a connected graph on $n\ge
n_0$ vertices with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and bandwidth at most $\beta
n$, then we have $R(G,H)=(\chi(H)-1)(n-1)+\sigma(H)$, where $\sigma(H)$ is the
smallest size of any part in any $\chi(H)$-partition of $H$. We also show that
the same conclusion holds without any restriction on the maximum degree of $G$
if the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $\epsilon(H) \log n/\log\log n$.


The Allen Telescope Array Pi GHz Sky Survey II. Daily and Monthly
  Monitoring for Transients and Variability in the Bootes Field

  We present results from daily radio continuum observations of the Bootes
field as part of the Pi GHz Sky Survey (PiGSS). These results are part of a
systematic and unbiased campaign to characterize variable and transient sources
in the radio sky. The observations include 78 individual epochs distributed
over 5 months at a radio frequency of 3.1 GHz with a median RMS image noise in
each epoch of 2.8 mJy. We produce 5 monthly images with a median RMS of 0.6
mJy. No transient radio sources are detected in the daily or monthly images. At
15 mJy, we set an upper limit (2 sigma) to the surface density of 1-day radio
transients at 0.025 deg^-2. At 5 mJy, we set an upper limit (2\sigma) to the
surface density of 1-month radio transients at 0.18 deg^-2. We also produce
light curves for 425 sources and explore the variability properties of these
sources. Approximately 20% of the sources exhibit some variability on daily and
monthly time scales. The maximum RMS fractional modulations on the 1 day and 1
month time scales for sources brighter than 10 mJy are 2 and 0.5, respectively.
The probability of a daily fluctuation for all sources and all epochs by a
factor of 10 is less than 10^-4. We compare the radio to mid-infrared
variability for sources in the field and find no correlation. Finally, we apply
the statistics of transient and variable populations to constrain models for a
variety of source classes.


Search for Anisotropy of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays with the
  Telescope Array Experiment

  We study the anisotropy of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) events
collected by the Telescope Array (TA) detector in the first 40 months of
operation. Following earlier studies, we examine event sets with energy
thresholds of 10 EeV, 40 EeV, and 57 EeV. We find that the distributions of the
events in right ascension and declination are compatible with an isotropic
distribution in all three sets. We then compare with previously reported
clustering of the UHECR events at small angular scales. No significant
clustering is found in the TA data. We then check the events with E>57 EeV for
correlations with nearby active galactic nuclei. No significant correlation is
found. Finally, we examine all three sets for correlations with the large-scale
structure of the Universe. We find that the two higher-energy sets are
compatible with both an isotropic distribution and the hypothesis that UHECR
sources follow the matter distribution of the Universe (the LSS hypothesis),
while the event set with E>10 EeV is compatible with isotropy and is not
compatible with the LSS hypothesis at 95% CL unless large deflection angles are
also assumed. We show that accounting for UHECR deflections in a realistic
model of the Galactic magnetic field can make this set compatible with the LSS
hypothesis.


The Astropy Problem

  The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org) is, in its own words, "a community
effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster
interoperability between Python astronomy packages." For five years this
project has been managed, written, and operated as a grassroots,
self-organized, almost entirely volunteer effort while the software is used by
the majority of the astronomical community. Despite this, the project has
always been and remains to this day effectively unfunded. Further, contributors
receive little or no formal recognition for creating and supporting what is now
critical software. This paper explores the problem in detail, outlines possible
solutions to correct this, and presents a few suggestions on how to address the
sustainability of general purpose astronomical software.


The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds. IV. Lupus
  Observed with MIPS

  We present maps of 7.78 square degrees of the Lupus molecular cloud complex
at 24, 70, and $160\:\mu$m. They were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope's
Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) instrument as part of the
Spitzer Legacy Program, ``From Molecular Cores to Planet-Forming Disks'' (c2d).
The maps cover three separate regions in Lupus, denoted I, III, and IV. We
discuss the c2d pipeline and how our data processing differs from it. We
compare source counts in the three regions with two other data sets and
predicted star counts from the Wainscoat model. This comparison shows the
contribution from background galaxies in Lupus I. We also create two color
magnitude diagrams using the 2MASS and MIPS data. From these results, we can
identify background galaxies and distinguish them from probable young stellar
objects. The sources in our catalogs are classified based on their spectral
energy distribution (SED) from 2MASS and Spitzer wavelengths to create a sample
of young stellar object candidates. From 2MASS data, we create extinction maps
for each region and note a strong corresponence between the extinction and the
$160\:\mu$m emission. The masses we derived in each Lupus cloud from our
extinction maps are compared to masses estimated from $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O
and found to be similar to our extinction masses in some regions, but
significantly different in others. Finally, based on our color-magnitude
diagrams, we selected 12 of our reddest candidate young stellar objects for
individual discussion. Five of the 12 appear to be newly-discovered YSOs.


Kepler Mission Design, Realized Photometric Performance, and Early
  Science

  The Kepler Mission, launched on Mar 6, 2009 was designed with the explicit
capability to detect Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of solar-like
stars using the transit photometry method. Results from just forty-three days
of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new
transiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbital
periods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique,
precise, extended and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety
of stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great
promise. To fully understand the methodology, processes and eventually the
results from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimately
led to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisite
photometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, we
present variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf stars
from red giants.


Discovery and Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect of Exoplanet Kepler-8b

  We report the discovery and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect of Kepler-8b, a
transiting planet identified by the NASA Kepler Mission. Kepler photometry and
Keck-HIRES radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet around
this F8IV subgiant host star. The planet has a radius RP = 1.419 RJ and a mass,
MP = 0.60 MJ, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest density
planets known. The orbital period is P = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axis
is 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 AU. The star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5
+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (V = 13.89 mag), both properties
deleterious to precise Doppler measurements. The velocities are indeed noisy,
with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with the
planet implied by the photometry. We securely detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit as
prograde. We measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbital
axis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,
indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. Rossiter-McLaughlin
measurements of a large sample of transiting planets from Kepler will provide a
statistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbit
orientations for hot jupiters in general.


Accelerating infall and rotational spin-up in the hot molecular core
  G31.41+0.31

  As part of our effort to search for circumstellar disks around high-mass
stellar objects, we observed the well-known core G31.41+0.31 with ALMA at 1.4
mm with an angular resolution of~0.22" (~1700 au). The dust continuum emission
has been resolved into two cores namely Main and NE. The Main core, which has
the stronger emission and is the more chemically rich, has a diameter of ~5300
au, and is associated with two free-free continuum sources. The Main core looks
featureless and homogeneous in dust continuum emission and does not present any
hint of fragmentation. Each transition of CH3CN and CH3OCHO, both ground and
vibrationally excited, as well as those of CH3CN isotopologues, shows a clear
velocity gradient along the NE-SW direction, with velocity linearly increasing
with distance from the center, consistent with solid-body rotation. However,
when comparing the velocity field of transitions with different upper level
energies, the rotation velocity increases with increasing energy of the
transition, which suggests that the rotation speeds up towards the center.
Spectral lines towards the dust continuum peak show an inverse P-Cygni profile
that supports the existence of infall in the core. The infall velocity
increases with the energy of the transition suggesting that the infall is
accelerating towards the center of the core, consistent with gravitational
collapse. Despite the monolithic appearance of the Main core, the presence of
red-shifted absorption, the existence of two embedded free-free sources at the
center, and the rotational spin-up are consistent with an unstable core
undergoing fragmentation with infall and differential rotation due to
conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the most likely explanation for
the monolithic morphology is that the large opacity of the dust emission
prevents the detection of any inhomogeneity in the core.


Chasing discs around O-type (proto)stars - ALMA evidence for an SiO disc
  and disc wind from G17.64+0.16

  We present high angular resolution 0.2 arcsec continuum and molecular
emission line Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations
of G17.64+0.16 in Band 6 (220GHz) taken as part of a campaign in search of
circumstellar discs around (proto)-O-stars. At a resolution of 400au the main
continuum core is essentially unresolved and isolated from other strong and
compact emission peaks. At a resolution of 400au the main continuum core is
essentially unresolved and isolated from other strong and compact emission
peaks. We detect SiO (5-4) emission that is marginally resolved and elongated
in a direction perpendicular to the large-scale outflow seen in the 13CO (2-1)
line using the main ALMA array in conjunction with the Atacama Compact Array
(ACA). Morphologically, the SiO appears to represent a disc-like structure.
Using parametric models we show that the position-velocity profile of the SiO
is consistent with the Keplerian rotation of a disc around an object between
10-30Mo in mass, only if there is also radial expansion from a separate
structure. The radial motion component can be interpreted as a disc wind from
the disc surface. Models with a central stellar object mass between 20 and 30Mo
are the most consistent with the stellar luminosity (100000 Lo) and indicative
of an O-type star. The H30a millimetre recombination line (231.9GHz) is also
detected, but spatially unresolved, and is indicative of a very compact, hot,
ionised region co-spatial with the dust continuum core. Accounting for all
observables, we suggest that G17.64 is consistent with a O-type young stellar
object in the final stages of protostellar assembly, driving a wind, but that
has not yet developed into a compact HII region. The existance and detection of
the disc in G17.64 is likely related to its isolated and possibly more evolved
nature, traits which may underpin discs in similar sources.


Hitomi Observations of the LMC SNR N132D: Highly Redshifted X-ray
  Emission from Iron Ejecta

  We present Hitomi observations of N132D, a young, X-ray bright, O-rich
core-collapse supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Despite a
very short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easily
detects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts in
each. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectral
resolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission is
dominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Fe
emission is highly redshifted at ~800 km/s compared to the local LMC
interstellar medium (ISM), with a 90% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if a
weakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates
(1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that these
ejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S K
velocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISM
material. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows the
He-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing the
outer shell. The results also show that even with a very small number of
counts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected in
extended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the very
low SXS background of ~1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, such
results are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similar
instruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imaging
observations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomi
and will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray Astronomy
Recovery Mission (XARM) and Athena.


First observations of speed of light tracks by a fluorescence detector
  looking down on the atmosphere

  EUSO-Balloon is a pathfinder mission for the Extreme Universe Space
Observatory onboard the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO). It was launched
on the moonless night of the 25$^{th}$ of August 2014 from Timmins, Canada. The
flight ended successfully after maintaining the target altitude of 38 km for
five hours. One part of the mission was a 2.5 hour underflight using a
helicopter equipped with three UV light sources (LED, xenon flasher and laser)
to perform an inflight calibration and examine the detectors capability to
measure tracks moving at the speed of light. We describe the helicopter laser
system and details of the underflight as well as how the laser tracks were
recorded and found in the data. These are the first recorded laser tracks
measured from a fluorescence detector looking down on the atmosphere. Finally,
we present a first reconstruction of the direction of the laser tracks relative
to the detector.


Searches for Large-Scale Anisotropy in the Arrival Directions of Cosmic
  Rays Detected above Energy of $10^{19}$ eV at the Pierre Auger Observatory
  and the Telescope Array

  Spherical harmonic moments are well-suited for capturing anisotropy at any
scale in the flux of cosmic rays. An unambiguous measurement of the full set of
spherical harmonic coefficients requires full-sky coverage. This can be
achieved by combining data from observatories located in both the northern and
southern hemispheres. To this end, a joint analysis using data recorded at the
Telescope Array and the Pierre Auger Observatory above $10^{19}$ eV is
presented in this work. The resulting multipolar expansion of the flux of
cosmic rays allows us to perform a series of anisotropy searches, and in
particular to report on the angular power spectrum of cosmic rays above
$10^{19}$ eV. No significant deviation from isotropic expectations is found
throughout the analyses performed. Upper limits on the amplitudes of the dipole
and quadrupole moments are derived as a function of the direction in the sky,
varying between 7% and 13% for the dipole and between 7% and 10% for a
symmetric quadrupole.


Hitomi constraints on the 3.5 keV line in the Perseus galaxy cluster

  High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Hitomi was expected to resolve the
origin of the faint unidentified E=3.5 keV emission line reported in several
low-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as galaxies and
clusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomi
first-light observation of the Perseus cluster. The emission line expected for
Perseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under the
dark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data.
However, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously high
compared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at the
reported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertainties
for this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% significance for a
broad dark-matter line and at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas. We do not
find anomalously high fluxes of the nearby faint K line or the Ar satellite
line that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. We
do find a hint of a broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions of
Sxvi (E=3.44 keV rest-frame) -- a possible signature of charge exchange in the
molecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentified line.
While its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely to
explain the MOS signal. A confirmation of this interesting feature has to wait
for a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.


Search for Thermal X-ray Features from the Crab nebula with Hitomi Soft
  X-ray Spectrometer

  The Crab nebula originated from a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion
observed in 1054 A.D. When viewed as a supernova remnant (SNR), it has an
anomalously low observed ejecta mass and kinetic energy for an Fe-core collapse
SN. Intensive searches were made for a massive shell that solves this
discrepancy, but none has been detected. An alternative idea is that the SN1054
is an electron-capture (EC) explosion with a lower explosion energy by an order
of magnitude than Fe-core collapse SNe. In the X-rays, imaging searches were
performed for the plasma emission from the shell in the Crab outskirts to set a
stringent upper limit to the X-ray emitting mass. However, the extreme
brightness of the source hampers access to its vicinity. We thus employed
spectroscopic technique using the X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard the Hitomi
satellite. By exploiting its superb energy resolution, we set an upper limit
for emission or absorption features from yet undetected thermal plasma in the
2-12 keV range. We also re-evaluated the existing Chandra and XMM-Newton data.
By assembling these results, a new upper limit was obtained for the X-ray
plasma mass of <~ 1Mo for a wide range of assumed shell radius, size, and
plasma temperature both in and out of the collisional equilibrium. To compare
with the observation, we further performed hydrodynamic simulations of the Crab
SNR for two SN models (Fe-core versus EC) under two SN environments (uniform
ISM versus progenitor wind). We found that the observed mass limit can be
compatible with both SN models if the SN environment has a low density of <~
0.03 cm-3 (Fe core) or <~ 0.1 cm-3 (EC) for the uniform density, or a
progenitor wind density somewhat less than that provided by a mass loss rate of
10-5 Mo yr-1 at 20 km s-1 for the wind environment.


Measurements of resonant scattering in the Perseus cluster core with
  Hitomi SXS

  Thanks to its high spectral resolution (~5 eV at 6 keV), the Soft X-ray
Spectrometer (SXS) on board Hitomi enables us to measure the detailed structure
of spatially resolved emission lines from highly ionized ions in galaxy
clusters for the first time. In this series of papers, using the SXS we have
measured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperature
structure of the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show that
when inferring physical properties from line emissivities in systems like
Perseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken into account. In
the Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He$\alpha$ line ($w$) - the
strongest line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line is
suppressed by a factor ~1.3 in the inner ~30 kpc, compared to predictions for
an optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases with the distance from the
center. The $w$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from the
same ion. The observed distortions of the $w$ line flux, shape and distance
dependence are all consistent with the expected effect of the resonant
scattering in the Perseus core. By measuring the ratio of fluxes in optically
thick ($w$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He$\beta$, Ly$\alpha$) lines, and
comparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations, the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results are
consistent with the direct measurements of gas velocities from line broadening
described elsewhere in this series, although the systematic and statistical
uncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions of
line emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-ray
missions will enable RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on the
amplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas motions.
