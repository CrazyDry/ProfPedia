Maximum planar subgraphs in dense graphs

  K\"uhn, Osthus and Taraz showed that for each \gamma>0 there exists C suchthat any n-vertex graph with minimum degree \gamma n contains a planar subgraphwith at least 2n-C edges. We find the optimum value of C for all \gamma<1/2 andsufficiently large n.

The Allen Telescope Array Commensal Observing System

  This memo describes the system used to conduct commensal correlator andbeamformer observations at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). This system wasdeployed for ~2 years until the ATA hibernation in 2011 and was responsible forcollecting >5 TB of data during thousands of hours of observations. The generalsystem design is presented and the implementation is discussed in detail. Iemphasize the rationale for various design decisions and attempt to document afew aspects of ATA operations that might not be obvious to non-insiders. Iclose with some recommendations from my experience developing the softwareinfrastructure and managing the correlator observations. These include: reuseexisting systems; solve, don't avoid, tensions between projects, and shareinfrastructure; plan to make standalone observations to complement thecommensal ones; and be considerate of observatory staff when deploying new andunusual observing modes. The structure of the software codebase is documented.

The Bandwidth Theorem in sparse graphs

  The bandwidth theorem [Mathematische Annalen, 343(1):175--205, 2009] statesthat any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree$\big(\tfrac{k-1}{k}+o(1)\big)n$ contains all $n$-vertex $k$-colourable graphs$H$ with bounded maximum degree and bandwidth $o(n)$. We provide sparseanalogues of this statement in random graphs as well as pseudorandom graphs.  More precisely, we show that for $p\gg \big(\tfrac{\logn}{n}\big)^{1/\Delta}$ a.a.s. each spanning subgraph $G$ of $G(n,p)$ withminimum degree $\big(\tfrac{k-1}{k}+o(1)\big)pn$ contains all $n$-vertex$k$-colourable graphs $H$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, bandwidth $o(n)$, andat least $C p^{-2}$ vertices not contained in any triangle. A similar result isshown for sufficiently bijumbled graphs, which, to the best of our knowledge,is the first resilience result in pseudorandom graphs for a rich class ofsubgraphs. Finally, we provide improved results for $H$ with small degeneracy,which in particular imply a resilience result in $G(n,p)$ with respect to thecontainment of spanning bounded degree trees for $p\gg \big(\tfrac{\logn}{n}\big)^{1/3}$.

A New Brown Dwarf Desert? A Scarcity of Wide Ultracool Binaries

  We present the results of a deep-imaging search for wide companions tolow-mass stars and brown dwarfs using NSFCam on IRTF. We searched a sample of132 M7-L8 dwarfs to magnitude limits of $J \sim 20.5$ and $K \sim 18.5$,corresponding to secondary-primary mass ratios of $\sim 0.5$. No companionswere found with separations between $2{\arcsec}$ to $31{\arcsec}$ ($\sim$40 AUto $\sim$1000 AU). This null result implies a wide companion frequency below2.3% at the 95% confidence level within the sensitivity limits of the survey.Preliminary modeling efforts indicate that we could have detected 85% ofcompanions more massive than $0.05 M_{\odot}$ and 50% above $0.03 M_{\odot}$.

Powers of Hamilton cycles in pseudorandom graphs

  We study the appearance of powers of Hamilton cycles in pseudorandom graphs,using the following comparatively weak pseudorandomness notion. A graph $G$ is$(\varepsilon,p,k,\ell)$-pseudorandom if for all disjoint $X$ and $Y\subsetV(G)$ with $|X|\ge\varepsilon p^kn$ and $|Y|\ge\varepsilon p^\ell n$ we have$e(X,Y)=(1\pm\varepsilon)p|X||Y|$. We prove that for all $\beta>0$ there is an$\varepsilon>0$ such that an $(\varepsilon,p,1,2)$-pseudorandom graph on $n$vertices with minimum degree at least $\beta pn$ contains the square of aHamilton cycle. In particular, this implies that $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs with$\lambda\ll d^{5/2 }n^{-3/2}$ contain the square of a Hamilton cycle, and thusa triangle factor if $n$ is a multiple of $3$. This improves on a result ofKrivelevich, Sudakov and Szab\'o [Triangle factors in sparse pseudo-randomgraphs, Combinatorica 24 (2004), no. 3, 403--426].  We also extend our result to higher powers of Hamilton cycles and establishcorresponding counting versions.

New Low-Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs with Disks in Lupus

  Using the Infrared Array Camera and the Multiband Imaging Photometer aboardthe {\it Spitzer Space Telescope}, we have obtained images of the Lupus 3star-forming cloud at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 \micron. We present photometryin these bands for the 41 previously known members that are within our images.In addition, we have identified 19 possible new members of the cloud based onred 3.6-8.0 \micron colors that are indicative of circumstellar disks. We haveperformed optical spectroscopy on 6 of these candidates, all of which areconfirmed as young low-mass members of Lupus 3. The spectral types of these newmembers range from M4.75 to M8, corresponding to masses of 0.2-0.03 $M_\odot$for ages of $\sim1$ Myr according to theoretical evolutionary models. We alsopresent optical spectroscopy of a candidate disk-bearing object in the vicinityof the Lupus 1 cloud, 2M 1541-3345, which Jayawardhana & Ivanov recentlyclassified as a young brown dwarf ($M\sim0.03$ $M_\odot$) with a spectral typeof M8. In contrast to their results, we measure an earlier spectral type ofM5.75$\pm$0.25 for this object, indicating that it is probably a low-mass star($M\sim0.1$ $M_\odot$). In fact, according to its gravity-sensitive absorptionlines and its luminosity, 2M 1541-3345 is older than members of the Lupusclouds ($\tau\sim1$ Myr) and instead is probably a more evolvedpre-main-sequence star that is not directly related to the current generationof star formation in Lupus.

A density CorrÃ¡di-Hajnal Theorem

  We find, for all sufficiently large $n$ and each $k$, the maximum number ofedges in an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain $k+1$ vertex-disjointtriangles.  This extends a result of Moon [Canad. J. Math. 20 (1968), 96-102] which is inturn an extension of Mantel's Theorem. Our result can also be viewed as adensity version of the Corradi-Hajnal Theorem.

Low-Mass Tertiary Companions to Spectroscopic Binaries I: Common Proper  Motion Survey for Wide Companions using 2MASS

  We report the first results of a multi-epoch search for wide (separationsgreater than a few tens of AU), low-mass tertiary companions of avolume-limited sample of 118 known spectroscopic binaries within 30 pc of theSun, using the 2MASS Point Source Catalog and follow-up observations with theKPNO and CTIO 4m telescopes. Note that this sample is not volume-complete butvolume-limited, and, thus, there is incompleteness in our reported companionrates. We are sensitive to common proper motion companions with separationsfrom roughly 200 AU to 10,000 AU (~10" -> ~10'). From 77 sources followed-up todate, we recover 11 previously known tertiaries, three previously knowncandidate tertiaries, of which two are spectroscopically confirmed and onerejected, and three new candidates, of which two are confirmed and onerejected. This yields an estimated wide tertiary fraction of 19.5^+5.2%_-3.7%.This observed fraction is consistent with predictions set out in star formationsimulations where the fraction of wide, low-mass companions to spectroscopicbinaries is >10%, and is roughly twice the wide companion rate of single stars.

Evaluating the Calorimeter Model with Broadband, Continuous Spectra of  Starburst Galaxies Observed with the Allen Telescope Array

  Although the relationship between the far-infrared and cm-wave radioluminosities of normal galaxies is one of the most striking correlations inastronomy, a solid understanding of its physical basis is lacking. In oneinterpretation, the "calorimeter model," rapid synchrotron cooling of cosmicray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship.Observed radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooledsynchrotron emission. In Thompson et al. (2006), a simple parameterized modelis presented to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might ariseeven in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionizationlosses and other cooling mechanisms. During the commissioning of the 42-elementAllen Telescope Array, we observed the starburst galaxies M82, NGC 253, and Arp220 at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7 GHz, obtaining unprecedented broadbandcontinuous radio spectra of these sources. We combine our observations withhigh-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermaland nonthermal components. The nonthermal components all steepen in the cm-waveregime and cannot be well-modeled as simple power laws. The model of Thompsonet al. is consistent with our M82 results when plausible parameters are chosen,and our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed modelparameters. The model is only marginally consistent with our NGC 253 data.Assuming the Thompson et al. model, a steep electron energy injection index ofp = -2.5 is ruled out in M82 and NGC 253 to >99% confidence. We describe indetail the observing procedures, calibration methods, analysis, and consistencychecks used for broadband spectral observations with the Allen Telescope Array.

Commensal observing with the Allen Telescope array: software command and  control

  The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a Large-Number-Small-Diameter radiotelescope array currently with 42 individual antennas and 5 independentback-end science systems (2 imaging FX correlators and 3 time domain beamformers) located at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCRO). The goal of the ATAis to run multiple back-ends simultaneously, supporting multiple scienceprojects commensally. The primary software control systems are based on acombination of Java, JRuby and Ruby on Rails. The primary control API issimplified to provide easy integration with new back-end systems while thelower layers of the software stack are handled by a master observing system.Scheduling observations for the ATA is based on finding a union between thescience needs of multiple projects and automatically determining an efficientpath to operating the various sub-components to meet those needs. Whencompleted, the ATA is expected to be a world-class radio telescope, combiningdedicated SETI projects with numerous radio astronomy science projects.

The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes, I. HI Observations of Edge-on Galaxies

  We present neutral hydrogen observations for a sample of eight nearby,late-type, edge-on galaxies. All of the galaxies have been well resolved in theradial direction, while six have also been well resolved in the verticaldirection. We find that each of the galaxies has approximately the same maximumsurface brightness temperature throughout its disc. We argue thatself-absorption is the main cause of this phenomenon and that subsequentdecompositions will require a treatment of this.

Turan numbers for bipartite graphs plus an odd cycle

  For an odd integer $k$, let $\mathcal{C}_k = \{C_3,C_5,...,C_k\}$ denote thefamily of all odd cycles of length at most $k$ and let $\mathcal{C}$ denote thefamily of all odd cycles. Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits \cite{ESi1} conjectured thatfor every family $\mathcal{F}$ of bipartite graphs, there exists $k$ such that$\ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}_k} \sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup\mathcal{C}}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. This conjecture was proved byErd\H{o}s and Simonovits when $\mathcal{F} = \{C_4\}$, and for certain familiesof even cycles in \cite{KSV}. In this paper, we give a general approach to theconjecture using Scott's sparse regularity lemma. Our approach proves theconjecture for complete bipartite graphs $K_{2,t}$ and $K_{3,3}$: we obtainmore strongly that for any odd $k \geq 5$, \[ \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \{C_k\}}\sim \ex{n}{\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{C}}\] and we show further that theextremal graphs can be made bipartite by deleting very few edges. In contrast,this formula does not extend to triangles -- the case $k = 3$ -- and we give analgebraic construction for odd $t \geq 3$ of $K_{2,t}$-free $C_3$-free graphswith substantially more edges than an extremal $K_{2,t}$-free bipartite graphon $n$ vertices. Our general approach to the Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits conjecture iseffective based on some reasonable assumptions on the maximum number of edgesin an $m$ by $n$ bipartite $\mathcal{F}$-free graph.

Luminosity Functions of Young Clusters: Modeling the Substellar Mass  Regime

  We predict near-infrared luminosity functions of young (5 Myr to 1 Gyr) starclusters by combining evolutionary models of very low-mass ($1 M_J$ to $0.15M_{\odot}$) dwarfs with empirical bolometric corrections. We identify severalcharacteristic features in our results. These can be attributed to threecauses: (1) deuterium burning in the most massive substellar objects; (2)methane absorption in bodies with $T_{eff}$ less than 1300 K, the temperatureof the L/T transition; and (3) the formation of dust clouds and the rainout ofdust at roughly the same effective temperature as methane formation. Accuratereconstruction of the substellar mass function from luminosity functionobservations requires that these phenomena are taken into account. At present,few observational studies extend to sufficient sensitivities to allow detectionof these effects. However, the luminosity function of the young open cluster IC2391 shows a clear peak at $M_I \sim 14$ which we attribute to the result ofdeuterium burning in substellar objects. The location of this feature is astrong function of age, and we estimate an age of 35 Myr for IC 2391. This issignificantly younger than the 53 Myr derived from the location of the lithiumdepletion boundary but agrees with the main sequence turnoff age. We considerthe implications of this result and our multi-band luminosity functions forfuture observational studies. All predicted luminosity function features are,or will be, accessible to observations using new wide-field IR imagers and theSpace Infrared Telescope Facility.

Tight cycles and regular slices in dense hypergraphs

  We study properties of random subcomplexes of partitions returned by (asuitable form of) the Strong Hypergraph Regularity Lemma, which we call regularslices. We argue that these subcomplexes capture many important structuralproperties of the original hypergraph. Accordingly we advocate their use inextremal hypergraph theory, and explain how they can lead to considerablesimplifications in existing proofs in this field. We also use them forestablishing the following two new results.  Firstly, we prove a hypergraph extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem: forevery $\delta>0$ every sufficiently large $k$-uniform hypergraph with at least$(\alpha+\delta)\binom{n}{k}$ edges contains a tight cycle of length $\alpha n$for each $\alpha\in[0,1]$.  Secondly, we find (asymptotically) the minimum codegree requirement for a$k$-uniform $k$-partite hypergraph, each of whose parts has $n$ vertices, tocontain a tight cycle of length $\alpha kn$, for each $0<\alpha<1$.

Two-Point Green's Function in PT-Symmetric Theories

  The Hamiltonian $H={1\over2} p^2+{1\over2}m^2x^2+gx^2(ix)^\delta$ with$\delta,g\geq0$ is non-Hermitian, but the energy levels are real and positiveas a consequence of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry. The quantum mechanical theorydescribed by $H$ is treated as a one-dimensional Euclidean quantum fieldtheory. The two-point Green's function for this theory is investigated usingperturbative and numerical techniques. The K\"allen-Lehmann representation forthe Green's function is constructed, and it is shown that by virtue of ${\calPT}$ symmetry the Green's function is entirely real. While the wave-functionrenormalization constant $Z$ cannot be interpreted as a conventionalprobability, it still obeys a normalization determined by the commutationrelations of the field. This provides strong evidence that the eigenfunctionsof the Hamiltonian are complete.

The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes II. The Galactus HI Modelling & Fitting  Tool

  We present a new HI modelling tool called \textsc{Galactus}. The program hasbeen designed to perform automated fits of disc-galaxy models to observations.It includes a treatment for the self-absorption of the gas. The software hasbeen released into the public domain. We describe the design philosophy andinner workings of the program. After this, we model the face-on galaxy NGC2403,using both self-absorption and optically thin models, showing thatself-absorption occurs even in face-on galaxies. It is shown that the maximumsurface brightness plateaus seen in Paper I of this series are indeed signs ofself-absorption. The apparent HI mass of an edge-on galaxy can be drasticallylower compared to that same galaxy seen face-on. The Tully-Fisher relation isfound to be relatively free from self-absorption issues.

The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes III. Kinematics and Structure of the HI  disc

  We present a new strategy for fitting the structure and kinematics of the HIin edge-on galaxies using a fit to the terminal-velocity channel maps of a HIdata cube. The strategy can deal with self-absorbing HI gas and the presence ofwarps. The method is first tested on a series of models. We demonstrate thatfitting optically thin models to real galaxies will lead to an overestimationof the thickness and velocity dispersion, and to a serious underestimation ofthe HI face-on column densities. We subsequently fit both self-absorption andoptically thin models to the HI data of six edge-on galaxies. In three of thesewe have also measured the velocity dispersion. On average 27 \pm 6 % of thetotal HI mass of edge-on galaxies is hidden by self-absorption. This impliesthat the HI mass, thickness and velocity dispersion of galaxies is typicallyunderestimated in the literature.

Workspace Aware Online Grasp Planning

  This work provides a framework for a workspace aware online grasp planner.This framework greatly improves the performance of standard online graspplanning algorithms by incorporating a notion of reachability into the onlinegrasp planning process. Offline, a database of hundreds of thousands of uniqueend-effector poses were queried for feasability. At runtime, our grasp planneruses this database to bias the hand towards reachable end-effectorconfigurations.  The bias keeps the grasp planner in accessible regions of the planning sceneso that the resulting grasps are tailored to the situation at hand. Thisresults in a higher percentage of reachable grasps, a higher percentage ofsuccessful grasp executions, and a reduced planning time. We also presentexperimental results using simulated and real environments.

Greedy low-rank algorithm for spatial connectome regression

  We study a smooth matrix regression problem formulated to recover brainconnectivity from data. The problem is set up as a general algebraic linearmatrix equation of high dimension, and the desired solution is approximated bya low-rank factorization. This factorization is computed iteratively by anefficient greedy low-rank algorithm that exploits important properties of theoriginal matrix equation, such as sparsity and positive definiteness. Theperformance of the method is evaluated on three test cases: a toy artificialdataset and two cortical problems employing data from the Allen Mouse BrainConnectivity Atlas. We find numerically that the method is significantly fasterthan previous gradient-based methods and converges to the full rank solution asthe rank increases. This speedup allows for the estimation of increasinglylarge-scale connectomes as these data become available from tracingexperiments.

Pixel-Attentive Policy Gradient for Multi-Fingered Grasping in Cluttered  Scenes

  Recent advances in on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods enabledlearning agents in virtual environments to master complex tasks withhigh-dimensional and continuous observation and action spaces. However,leveraging this family of algorithms in multi-fingered robotic grasping remainsa challenge due to large sim-to-real fidelity gaps and the high samplecomplexity of on-policy RL algorithms. This work aims to bridge these gaps byfirst reinforcement-learning a multi-fingered robotic grasping policy insimulation that operates in the pixel space of the input: a single depth image.Using a mapping from pixel space to Cartesian space according to the depth map,this method transfers to the real world with high fidelity and introduces anovel attention mechanism that substantially improves grasp success rate incluttered environments. Finally, the direct-generative nature of this methodallows learning of multi-fingered grasps that have flexible end-effectorpositions, orientations and rotations, as well as all degrees of freedom of thehand.

The Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey -- A  700-Square-Degree, Multi-Epoch Radio Dataset -- II: Individual Epoch  Transient Statistics

  We present our second paper on the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeterSurvey (ATATS), a multi-epoch, ~700 sq. deg. radio image and catalog at 1.4GHz. The survey is designed to detect rare, bright transients as well as tocommission the ATA's wide-field survey capabilities. ATATS explores thechallenges of multi-epoch transient and variable source surveys in the domainof dynamic range limits and changing (u,v) coverage.  Here we present images made using data from the individual epochs, as well asa revised image combining data from all ATATS epochs. The combined image hasRMS noise 3.96 mJy / beam, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. Thecatalog, generated using a false detection rate algorithm, contains 4984sources, and is >90% complete to 37.9 mJy. The catalogs generated from snapshotimages of the individual epochs contain between 1170 and 2019 sources over the564 sq. deg. area in common to all epochs. The 90% completeness limits of thesingle epoch catalogs range from 98.6 to 232 mJy.  We compare the catalog generated from the combined image to those fromindividual epochs, and from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), a legacy survey atthe same frequency. We are able to place new constraints on the transientpopulation: fewer than 6e-4 transients / sq. deg., for transients brighter than350 mJy with characteristic timescales of minutes to days. This strongly rulesout an astronomical origin for the ~1 Jy sources reported by Matsumura et al.(2009), based on their stated rate of 3.1e-3 / sq. deg.

The Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey - A  690-Square-Degree, 12-Epoch Radio Dataset - I: Catalog and Long-Duration  Transient Statistics

  We present the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter Survey (ATATS), amulti-epoch (12 visits), 690 square degree radio image and catalog at 1.4GHz.The survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as toverify the capabilities of the ATA to form large mosaics. The combined imageusing data from all 12 ATATS epochs has RMS noise sigma = 3.94mJy / beam anddynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. It contains 4408sources to a limiting sensitivity of S = 20 mJy / beam. We compare the cataloggenerated from this 12-epoch combined image to the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS),a legacy survey at the same frequency, and find that we can measure sourcepositions to better than ~20 arcsec. For sources above the ATATS completenesslimit, the median flux density is 97% of the median value for matched NVSSsources, indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration. We examine theeffects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution betweenATATS and NVSS on our ability to compare flux densities. We detect notransients at flux densities greater than 40 mJy in comparison with NVSS, andplace a 2-sigma upper limit on the transient rate for such sources of 0.004 persquare degree. These results suggest that the > 1 Jy transients reported byMatsumura et al. (2009) may not be true transients, but rather variable sourcesat their flux density threshold.

The Allen Telescope Array Pi GHz Sky Survey I. Survey Description and  Static Catalog Results for the Bootes Field

  The Pi GHz Sky Survey (PiGSS) is a key project of the Allen Telescope Array.PiGSS is a 3.1 GHz survey of radio continuum emission in the extragalactic skywith an emphasis on synoptic observations that measure the static andtime-variable properties of the sky. During the 2.5-year campaign, PiGSS willtwice observe ~250,000 radio sources in the 10,000 deg^2 region of the sky withb > 30 deg to an rms sensitivity of ~1 mJy. Additionally, sub-regions of thesky will be observed multiple times to characterize variability on time scalesof days to years. We present here observations of a 10 deg^2 region in theBootes constellation overlapping the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey field. ThePiGSS image was constructed from 75 daily observations distributed over a4-month period and has an rms flux density between 200 and 250 microJy. Thisrepresents a deeper image by a factor of 4 to 8 than we will achieve over theentire 10,000 deg^2. We provide flux densities, source sizes, and spectralindices for the 425 sources detected in the image. We identify ~100$ new flatspectrum radio sources; we project that when completed PiGSS will identify 10^4flat spectrum sources. We identify one source that is a possible transientradio source. This survey provides new limits on faint radio transients andvariables with characteristic durations of months.

Primary Beam and Dish Surface Characterization at the Allen Telescope  Array by Radio Holography

  The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a cm-wave interferometer in California,comprising 42 antenna elements with 6-m diameter dishes. We characterize theantenna optical accuracy using two-antenna interferometry and radio holography.The distortion of each telescope relative to the average is small, with RMSdifferences of 1 percent of beam peak value. Holography provides images of dishillumination pattern, allowing characterization of as-built mirror surfaces.The ATA dishes can experience mm-scale distortions across -2 meter lengths dueto mounting stresses or solar radiation. Experimental RMS errors are 0.7 mm atnight and 3 mm under worst case solar illumination. For frequencies 4, 10, and15 GHz, the nighttime values indicate sensitivity losses of 1, 10 and 20percent, respectively. The ATA.s exceptional wide-bandwidth permitsobservations over a continuous range 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, and future retrofits mayincrease this range to 15 GHz. Beam patterns show a slowly varying focusfrequency dependence. We probe the antenna optical gain and beam patternstability as a function of focus and observation frequency, concluding that ATAcan produce high fidelity images over a decade of simultaneous observationfrequencies. In the day, the antenna sensitivity and pointing accuracy areaffected. We find that at frequencies greater than 5 GHz, daytime observationsgreater than 5 GHz will suffer some sensitivity loss and it may be necessary tomake antenna pointing corrections on a 1 to 2 hourly basis.

ASGARD: A Large Survey for Slow Galactic Radio Transients. I. Overview  and First Results

  Searches for slow radio transients and variables have generally focused onextragalactic populations, and the basic parameters of Galactic populationsremain poorly characterized. We present a large 3 GHz survey performed with theAllen Telescope Array (ATA) that aims to improve this situation: ASGARD, theATA Survey of Galactic Radio Dynamism. ASGARD observations spanned 2 years withweekly visits to 23 deg^2 in two fields in the Galactic Plane, totaling 900 hrof integration time on science fields and making it significantly larger thanprevious efforts. The typical blind unresolved source detection limit was 10mJy. We describe the observations and data analysis techniques in detail,demonstrating our ability to create accurate wide-field images whileeffectively modeling and subtracting large-scale radio emission, allowingstandard transient-and-variability analysis techniques to be used. We presentearly results from the analysis of two pointings: one centered on themicroquasar Cygnus X-3 and one overlapping the Kepler field of view (l =76{\deg}, b = +13.5{\deg}). Our results include images, catalog statistics,completeness functions, variability measurements, and a transient search. Outof 134 sources detected in these pointings, the only compellingly variable oneis Cygnus X-3, and no transients are detected. We estimate number counts forpotential Galactic radio transients and compare our current limits to previouswork and our projection for the fully-analyzed ASGARD dataset.

Grains in Photo-Ionized Environments

  Ever since the pioneering study of Spitzer, it has been widely recognizedthat grains play an important role in the heating and cooling of photo-ionizedenvironments. This includes the diffuse ISM, as well as H II regions, planetarynebulae, and photo-dissociation regions.  A detailed code is necessary to model grains in a photo-ionized medium sincethe interactions of grains with their environment include a host ofmicrophysical processes, and their importance can only be judged by performinga complete simulation. In this paper we will use the spectral synthesis codeCloudy for this purpose. A comprehensive upgrade of the grain model has beenrecently incorporated in Cloudy, and certain aspects of this upgrade will bediscussed. Special emphasis will be on the new grain charge model. We willconsider in detail the physics of grains in both ionized and neutralenvironments, and will present a calculation of photo-electric heating andcollisional cooling rates for a range of physical conditions and grainmaterials and for a range of grain sizes (including a realistic sizedistribution). We conclude with a brief discussion of the problems currentlyhampering progress in this field. The new grain model will be used to model thesilicate emission in the Ney-Allen nebula, and will help us better understandthe nature of the grains in that part of the Orion complex.

The Spitzer c2d survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds. V.  Chamaeleon II Observed with IRAC

  We present IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron) observations of theChamaeleon II molecular cloud. The observed area covers about 1 square degreedefined by $A_V >2$. Analysis of the data in the 2005 c2d catalogs reveals asmall number of sources (40) with properties similar to those of youngstellaror substellar objects (YSOs). The surface density of these YSOcandidates is low, and contamination by background galaxies appears to besubstantial, especially for sources classified as Class I or flat SED. Wediscuss this problem in some detail and conclude that very few of the candidateYSOs in early evolutionary stages are actually in the Cha II cloud. Using arefined set of criteria, we define a smaller, but more reliable, set of 24 YSOcandidates.

The Shape of Dark Matter Haloes, V. Analysis of observations of edge-on  galaxies

  In the previous papers in this series, we have measured the stellar and \hicontent in a sample of edge-on galaxies. In the present paper, we perform asimultaneous rotation curve and vertical force field gradient decomposition forfive of these edge-on galaxies. The rotation curve decomposition provides ameasure of the radial dark matter potential, while the vertical force fieldgradient provide a measure of the vertical dark matter potential. We fit darkmatter halo models to these potentials. Using our \hi self-absorption results,we find that a typical dark matter halo has a less dense core($0.094\pm0.230$\,M$_\odot$/pc$^3$) compared to an optically thin \hi model($0.150\pm0.124$\,M$_\odot$/pc$^3$). The HI self-absorption dark matter halohas a longer scale length $R_c$ of $1.42\pm 3.48$\,kpc, versus $1.10\pm1.81$\,kpc for the optically thin HI model. The median halo shape is spherical,at $q=1.0\pm0.6$ (self-absorbing \hi), while it is prolate at $q=1.5\pm0.6$ forthe optically thin. Our best results were obtained for ESO\,274-G001 andUGC\,7321, for which we were able to measure the velocity dispersion in PaperIII. These two galaxies have drastically different halo shapes, with one oblateand one strongly prolate. Overall, we find that the many assumptions requiredmake this type of analysis susceptible to errors.

Analysis of large-scale anisotropy of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in  HiRes data

  Stereo data collected by the HiRes experiment over a six year period areexamined for large-scale anisotropy related to the inhomogeneous distributionof matter in the nearby Universe. We consider the generic case of smallcosmic-ray deflections and a large number of sources tracing the matterdistribution. In this matter tracer model the expected cosmic ray flux dependsessentially on a single free parameter, the typical deflection angle theta. Wefind that the HiRes data with threshold energies of 40 EeV and 57 EeV areincompatible with the matter tracer model at a 95% confidence level unlesstheta is larger than 10 degrees and are compatible with an isotropic flux. Thedata set above 10 EeV is compatible with both the matter tracer model and anisotropic flux.

The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds: VII.  Ophiuchus Observed with MIPS

  We present maps of 14.4 deg^2 of the Ophiuchus dark clouds observed by theSpitzer Space Telescope Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). Thesehigh quality maps depict both numerous point sources as well as extended dustemission within the star-forming and non-star-forming portions of these clouds.Using PSF-fitting photometry, we detect 5779 sources at 24 um and 81 sources at70 um at the 10 sigma level of significance. Three hundred twenty-threecandidate young stellar objects (YSOs) were identified according to theirpositions on the MIPS/2MASS K versus K$-$[24] color-magnitude diagrams ascompared to 24 um detections in the SWIRE extragalactic survey. We find thatmore than half of the YSO candidates, and almost all the ones with protostellarClass I spectral energy distributions, are confined to the known cluster andaggregates.

Development of the (d,n) proton-transfer reaction in inverse kinematics  for structure studies

  Transfer reactions have provided exciting opportunities to study thestructure of exotic nuclei and are often used to inform studies relating tonucleosynthesis and applications. In order to benefit from these reactions andtheir application to rare ion beams (RIBs) it is necessary to develop the toolsand techniques to perform and analyze the data from reactions performed ininverse kinematics, that is with targets of light nuclei and heavier beams. Weare continuing to expand the transfer reaction toolbox in preparation for thenext generation of facilities, such as the Facility for Rare Ion Beams (FRIB),which is scheduled for completion in 2022. An important step in this process isto perform the (d,n) reaction in inverse kinematics, with analyses that includeQ-value spectra and differential cross sections. In this way, proton-transferreactions can be placed on the same level as the more commonly usedneutron-transfer reactions, such as (d,p), (9Be,8Be), and (13C,12C). Here wepresent an overview of the techniques used in (d,p) and (d,n), and some recentdata from (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics using stable beams of 12C and16O.

The 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (2SLAQ) Luminous Red Galaxy Survey

  We present a spectroscopic survey of almost 15,000 candidateintermediate-redshift Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) brighter than i=19.8,observed with 2dF on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The targets were selectedphotometrically from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and lie along twonarrow equatorial strips covering 180 sq deg. Reliable redshifts were obtainedfor 92% of the targets and the selection is very efficient: over 90% haveredshifts between 0.45 and 0.8. More than 80% of the ~11,000 red galaxies havepure absorption-line spectra consistent with a passively-evolving old stellarpopulation. The redshift, photometric and spatial distributions of the LRGs aredescribed. The 2SLAQ data will be released publicly from mid-2006, providing apowerful resource for observational cosmology and the study of galaxyevolution.

Mass Transport Processes and their Roles in the Formation, Structure,  and Evolution of Stars and Stellar Systems

  We summarize some of the compelling new scientific opportunities forunderstanding stars and stellar systems that can be enabled by sub-mas angularresolution, UV/Optical spectral imaging observations, which can reveal thedetails of the many dynamic processes (e.g., variable magnetic fields,accretion, convection, shocks, pulsations, winds, and jets) that affect theirformation, structure, and evolution. These observations can only be provided bylong-baseline interferometers or sparse aperture telescopes in space, since theaperture diameters required are in excess of 500 m - a regime in whichmonolithic or segmented designs are not and will not be feasible - and sincethey require observations at wavelengths (UV) not accessible from the ground.Two mission concepts which could provide these invaluable observations areNASA's Stellar Imager (SI; http://hires.gsfc.nasa.gov/si/) interferometer andESA's Luciola sparse aperture hypertelescope, which each could resolve hundredsof stars and stellar systems. These observatories will also open an immense newdiscovery space for astrophysical research in general and, in particular, forActive Galactic Nuclei (Kraemer et al. Decadal Survey Science Whitepaper). Thetechnology developments needed for these missions are challenging, buteminently feasible (Carpenter et al. Decadal Survey Technology Whitepaper) witha reasonable investment over the next decade to enable flight in the 2025+timeframe. That investment would enable tremendous gains in our understandingof the individual stars and stellar systems that are the building blocks of ourUniverse and which serve as the hosts for life throughout the Cosmos.

Overview of the Kepler Science Processing Pipeline

  The Kepler Mission Science Operations Center (SOC) performs several criticalfunctions including managing the ~156,000 target stars, associated targettables, science data compression tables and parameters, as well as processingthe raw photometric data downlinked from the spacecraft each month. The rawdata are first calibrated at the pixel level to correct for bias, smear inducedby a shutterless readout, and other detector and electronic effects. Abackground sky flux is estimated from ~4500 pixels on each of the 84 CCDreadout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimalaperture for each star. Ancillary engineering data and diagnostic informationextracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in theflux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching forsignatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter.Stars with signatures exceeding 7.1 sigma are subjected to a suite ofstatistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion toreject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. Physicalparameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature,and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residuallight curve. The pipeline is operational, finding planetary signatures andproviding robust eliminations of false positives.

Primary Beam Shape Calibration from Mosaicked, Interferometric  Observations

  Image quality in mosaicked observations from interferometric radio telescopesis strongly dependent on the accuracy with which the antenna primary beam iscalibrated. The next generation of radio telescope arrays such as the AllenTelescope Array (ATA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) have key sciencegoals that involve making large mosaicked observations filled with bright pointsources. We present a new method for calibrating the shape of the telescope'smean primary beam that uses the multiple redundant observations of these brightsources in the mosaic. The method has an analytical solution for simpleGaussian beam shapes but can also be applied to more complex beam shapesthrough $\chi^2$ minimization. One major benefit of this simple, conceptuallyclean method is that it makes use of the science data for calibration purposes,thus saving telescope time and improving accuracy through simultaneouscalibration and observation. We apply the method both to 1.43 GHz data takenduring the ATA Twenty Centimeter Survey (ATATS) and to 3.14 GHz data takenduring the ATA's Pi Gigahertz Sky Survey (PiGSS). We find that the beam'scalculated full width at half maximum (FWHM) values are consistent with thetheoretical values, the values measured by several independent methods, and thevalues from the simulation we use to demonstrate the effectiveness of ourmethod on data from future telescopes such as the expanded ATA and the SKA.These results are preliminary, and can be expanded upon by fitting more complexbeam shapes. We also investigate, by way of a simulation, the dependence of theaccuracy of the telescope's FWHM on antenna number. We find that theuncertainty returned by our fitting method is inversely proportional to thenumber of antennas in the array.

Ramsey-goodness -- and otherwise

  A celebrated result of Chv\'atal, R\"odl, Szemer\'edi and Trotter states (inslightly weakened form) that, for every natural number $\Delta$, there is aconstant $r_\Delta$ such that, for any connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ withmaximum degree $\Delta$, the Ramsey number $R(G,G)$ is at most $r_\Delta n$,provided $n$ is sufficiently large. In 1987, Burr made a strong conjectureimplying that one may take $r_\Delta = \Delta$. However, Graham, R\"odl andRuci\'nski showed, by taking $G$ to be a suitable expander graph, thatnecessarily $r_\Delta > 2^{c\Delta}$ for some constant $c>0$. We show that theuse of expanders is essential: if we impose the additional restriction that thebandwidth of $G$ be at most some function $\beta (n) = o(n)$, then $R(G,G) \le(2\chi(G)+4)n\leq (2\Delta+6)n$, i.e., $r_\Delta = 2\Delta +6$ suffices. On theother hand, we show that Burr's conjecture itself fails even for $P_n^k$, the$k$th power of a path $P_n$. Brandt showed that for any $c$, if $\Delta$ issufficiently large, there are connected $n$-vertex graphs $G$ with$\Delta(G)\leq\Delta$ but $R(G,K_3)>cn$. We show that, given $\Delta$ and $H$,there are $\beta>0$ and $n_0$ such that, if $G$ is a connected graph on $n\gen_0$ vertices with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and bandwidth at most $\betan$, then we have $R(G,H)=(\chi(H)-1)(n-1)+\sigma(H)$, where $\sigma(H)$ is thesmallest size of any part in any $\chi(H)$-partition of $H$. We also show thatthe same conclusion holds without any restriction on the maximum degree of $G$if the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $\epsilon(H) \log n/\log\log n$.

The Allen Telescope Array Pi GHz Sky Survey II. Daily and Monthly  Monitoring for Transients and Variability in the Bootes Field

  We present results from daily radio continuum observations of the Bootesfield as part of the Pi GHz Sky Survey (PiGSS). These results are part of asystematic and unbiased campaign to characterize variable and transient sourcesin the radio sky. The observations include 78 individual epochs distributedover 5 months at a radio frequency of 3.1 GHz with a median RMS image noise ineach epoch of 2.8 mJy. We produce 5 monthly images with a median RMS of 0.6mJy. No transient radio sources are detected in the daily or monthly images. At15 mJy, we set an upper limit (2 sigma) to the surface density of 1-day radiotransients at 0.025 deg^-2. At 5 mJy, we set an upper limit (2\sigma) to thesurface density of 1-month radio transients at 0.18 deg^-2. We also producelight curves for 425 sources and explore the variability properties of thesesources. Approximately 20% of the sources exhibit some variability on daily andmonthly time scales. The maximum RMS fractional modulations on the 1 day and 1month time scales for sources brighter than 10 mJy are 2 and 0.5, respectively.The probability of a daily fluctuation for all sources and all epochs by afactor of 10 is less than 10^-4. We compare the radio to mid-infraredvariability for sources in the field and find no correlation. Finally, we applythe statistics of transient and variable populations to constrain models for avariety of source classes.

Search for Anisotropy of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays with the  Telescope Array Experiment

  We study the anisotropy of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) eventscollected by the Telescope Array (TA) detector in the first 40 months ofoperation. Following earlier studies, we examine event sets with energythresholds of 10 EeV, 40 EeV, and 57 EeV. We find that the distributions of theevents in right ascension and declination are compatible with an isotropicdistribution in all three sets. We then compare with previously reportedclustering of the UHECR events at small angular scales. No significantclustering is found in the TA data. We then check the events with E>57 EeV forcorrelations with nearby active galactic nuclei. No significant correlation isfound. Finally, we examine all three sets for correlations with the large-scalestructure of the Universe. We find that the two higher-energy sets arecompatible with both an isotropic distribution and the hypothesis that UHECRsources follow the matter distribution of the Universe (the LSS hypothesis),while the event set with E>10 EeV is compatible with isotropy and is notcompatible with the LSS hypothesis at 95% CL unless large deflection angles arealso assumed. We show that accounting for UHECR deflections in a realisticmodel of the Galactic magnetic field can make this set compatible with the LSShypothesis.

The Astropy Problem

  The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org) is, in its own words, "a communityeffort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and fosterinteroperability between Python astronomy packages." For five years thisproject has been managed, written, and operated as a grassroots,self-organized, almost entirely volunteer effort while the software is used bythe majority of the astronomical community. Despite this, the project hasalways been and remains to this day effectively unfunded. Further, contributorsreceive little or no formal recognition for creating and supporting what is nowcritical software. This paper explores the problem in detail, outlines possiblesolutions to correct this, and presents a few suggestions on how to address thesustainability of general purpose astronomical software.

The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds. IV. Lupus  Observed with MIPS

  We present maps of 7.78 square degrees of the Lupus molecular cloud complexat 24, 70, and $160\:\mu$m. They were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope'sMultiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) instrument as part of theSpitzer Legacy Program, ``From Molecular Cores to Planet-Forming Disks'' (c2d).The maps cover three separate regions in Lupus, denoted I, III, and IV. Wediscuss the c2d pipeline and how our data processing differs from it. Wecompare source counts in the three regions with two other data sets andpredicted star counts from the Wainscoat model. This comparison shows thecontribution from background galaxies in Lupus I. We also create two colormagnitude diagrams using the 2MASS and MIPS data. From these results, we canidentify background galaxies and distinguish them from probable young stellarobjects. The sources in our catalogs are classified based on their spectralenergy distribution (SED) from 2MASS and Spitzer wavelengths to create a sampleof young stellar object candidates. From 2MASS data, we create extinction mapsfor each region and note a strong corresponence between the extinction and the$160\:\mu$m emission. The masses we derived in each Lupus cloud from ourextinction maps are compared to masses estimated from $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$Oand found to be similar to our extinction masses in some regions, butsignificantly different in others. Finally, based on our color-magnitudediagrams, we selected 12 of our reddest candidate young stellar objects forindividual discussion. Five of the 12 appear to be newly-discovered YSOs.

Kepler Mission Design, Realized Photometric Performance, and Early  Science

  The Kepler Mission, launched on Mar 6, 2009 was designed with the explicitcapability to detect Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of solar-likestars using the transit photometry method. Results from just forty-three daysof data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five newtransiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbitalperiods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique,precise, extended and nearly continuous data set for a large number and varietyof stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show greatpromise. To fully understand the methodology, processes and eventually theresults from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimatelyled to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisitephotometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, wepresent variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf starsfrom red giants.

Discovery and Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect of Exoplanet Kepler-8b

  We report the discovery and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect of Kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the NASA Kepler Mission. Kepler photometry andKeck-HIRES radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis F8IV subgiant host star. The planet has a radius RP = 1.419 RJ and a mass,MP = 0.60 MJ, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. The orbital period is P = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 AU. The star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (V = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise Doppler measurements. The velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. We securely detect the Rossiter-McLaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. We measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. Rossiter-McLaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from Kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

Accelerating infall and rotational spin-up in the hot molecular core  G31.41+0.31

  As part of our effort to search for circumstellar disks around high-massstellar objects, we observed the well-known core G31.41+0.31 with ALMA at 1.4mm with an angular resolution of~0.22" (~1700 au). The dust continuum emissionhas been resolved into two cores namely Main and NE. The Main core, which hasthe stronger emission and is the more chemically rich, has a diameter of ~5300au, and is associated with two free-free continuum sources. The Main core looksfeatureless and homogeneous in dust continuum emission and does not present anyhint of fragmentation. Each transition of CH3CN and CH3OCHO, both ground andvibrationally excited, as well as those of CH3CN isotopologues, shows a clearvelocity gradient along the NE-SW direction, with velocity linearly increasingwith distance from the center, consistent with solid-body rotation. However,when comparing the velocity field of transitions with different upper levelenergies, the rotation velocity increases with increasing energy of thetransition, which suggests that the rotation speeds up towards the center.Spectral lines towards the dust continuum peak show an inverse P-Cygni profilethat supports the existence of infall in the core. The infall velocityincreases with the energy of the transition suggesting that the infall isaccelerating towards the center of the core, consistent with gravitationalcollapse. Despite the monolithic appearance of the Main core, the presence ofred-shifted absorption, the existence of two embedded free-free sources at thecenter, and the rotational spin-up are consistent with an unstable coreundergoing fragmentation with infall and differential rotation due toconservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the most likely explanation forthe monolithic morphology is that the large opacity of the dust emissionprevents the detection of any inhomogeneity in the core.

Chasing discs around O-type (proto)stars - ALMA evidence for an SiO disc  and disc wind from G17.64+0.16

  We present high angular resolution 0.2 arcsec continuum and molecularemission line Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observationsof G17.64+0.16 in Band 6 (220GHz) taken as part of a campaign in search ofcircumstellar discs around (proto)-O-stars. At a resolution of 400au the maincontinuum core is essentially unresolved and isolated from other strong andcompact emission peaks. At a resolution of 400au the main continuum core isessentially unresolved and isolated from other strong and compact emissionpeaks. We detect SiO (5-4) emission that is marginally resolved and elongatedin a direction perpendicular to the large-scale outflow seen in the 13CO (2-1)line using the main ALMA array in conjunction with the Atacama Compact Array(ACA). Morphologically, the SiO appears to represent a disc-like structure.Using parametric models we show that the position-velocity profile of the SiOis consistent with the Keplerian rotation of a disc around an object between10-30Mo in mass, only if there is also radial expansion from a separatestructure. The radial motion component can be interpreted as a disc wind fromthe disc surface. Models with a central stellar object mass between 20 and 30Moare the most consistent with the stellar luminosity (100000 Lo) and indicativeof an O-type star. The H30a millimetre recombination line (231.9GHz) is alsodetected, but spatially unresolved, and is indicative of a very compact, hot,ionised region co-spatial with the dust continuum core. Accounting for allobservables, we suggest that G17.64 is consistent with a O-type young stellarobject in the final stages of protostellar assembly, driving a wind, but thathas not yet developed into a compact HII region. The existance and detection ofthe disc in G17.64 is likely related to its isolated and possibly more evolvednature, traits which may underpin discs in similar sources.

Hitomi Observations of the LMC SNR N132D: Highly Redshifted X-ray  Emission from Iron Ejecta

  We present Hitomi observations of N132D, a young, X-ray bright, O-richcore-collapse supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Despite avery short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easilydetects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts ineach. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectralresolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission isdominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Feemission is highly redshifted at ~800 km/s compared to the local LMCinterstellar medium (ISM), with a 90% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if aweakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates(1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that theseejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S Kvelocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISMmaterial. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows theHe-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing theouter shell. The results also show that even with a very small number ofcounts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected inextended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the verylow SXS background of ~1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, suchresults are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similarinstruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imagingobservations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomiand will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray AstronomyRecovery Mission (XARM) and Athena.

First observations of speed of light tracks by a fluorescence detector  looking down on the atmosphere

  EUSO-Balloon is a pathfinder mission for the Extreme Universe SpaceObservatory onboard the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO). It was launchedon the moonless night of the 25$^{th}$ of August 2014 from Timmins, Canada. Theflight ended successfully after maintaining the target altitude of 38 km forfive hours. One part of the mission was a 2.5 hour underflight using ahelicopter equipped with three UV light sources (LED, xenon flasher and laser)to perform an inflight calibration and examine the detectors capability tomeasure tracks moving at the speed of light. We describe the helicopter lasersystem and details of the underflight as well as how the laser tracks wererecorded and found in the data. These are the first recorded laser tracksmeasured from a fluorescence detector looking down on the atmosphere. Finally,we present a first reconstruction of the direction of the laser tracks relativeto the detector.

Searches for Large-Scale Anisotropy in the Arrival Directions of Cosmic  Rays Detected above Energy of $10^{19}$ eV at the Pierre Auger Observatory  and the Telescope Array

  Spherical harmonic moments are well-suited for capturing anisotropy at anyscale in the flux of cosmic rays. An unambiguous measurement of the full set ofspherical harmonic coefficients requires full-sky coverage. This can beachieved by combining data from observatories located in both the northern andsouthern hemispheres. To this end, a joint analysis using data recorded at theTelescope Array and the Pierre Auger Observatory above $10^{19}$ eV ispresented in this work. The resulting multipolar expansion of the flux ofcosmic rays allows us to perform a series of anisotropy searches, and inparticular to report on the angular power spectrum of cosmic rays above$10^{19}$ eV. No significant deviation from isotropic expectations is foundthroughout the analyses performed. Upper limits on the amplitudes of the dipoleand quadrupole moments are derived as a function of the direction in the sky,varying between 7% and 13% for the dipole and between 7% and 10% for asymmetric quadrupole.

Hitomi constraints on the 3.5 keV line in the Perseus galaxy cluster

  High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Hitomi was expected to resolve theorigin of the faint unidentified E=3.5 keV emission line reported in severallow-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as galaxies andclusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomifirst-light observation of the Perseus cluster. The emission line expected forPerseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under thedark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data.However, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously highcompared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at thereported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertaintiesfor this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% significance for abroad dark-matter line and at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas. We do notfind anomalously high fluxes of the nearby faint K line or the Ar satelliteline that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. Wedo find a hint of a broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions ofSxvi (E=3.44 keV rest-frame) -- a possible signature of charge exchange in themolecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentified line.While its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely toexplain the MOS signal. A confirmation of this interesting feature has to waitfor a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.

Search for Thermal X-ray Features from the Crab nebula with Hitomi Soft  X-ray Spectrometer

  The Crab nebula originated from a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosionobserved in 1054 A.D. When viewed as a supernova remnant (SNR), it has ananomalously low observed ejecta mass and kinetic energy for an Fe-core collapseSN. Intensive searches were made for a massive shell that solves thisdiscrepancy, but none has been detected. An alternative idea is that the SN1054is an electron-capture (EC) explosion with a lower explosion energy by an orderof magnitude than Fe-core collapse SNe. In the X-rays, imaging searches wereperformed for the plasma emission from the shell in the Crab outskirts to set astringent upper limit to the X-ray emitting mass. However, the extremebrightness of the source hampers access to its vicinity. We thus employedspectroscopic technique using the X-ray micro-calorimeter onboard the Hitomisatellite. By exploiting its superb energy resolution, we set an upper limitfor emission or absorption features from yet undetected thermal plasma in the2-12 keV range. We also re-evaluated the existing Chandra and XMM-Newton data.By assembling these results, a new upper limit was obtained for the X-rayplasma mass of <~ 1Mo for a wide range of assumed shell radius, size, andplasma temperature both in and out of the collisional equilibrium. To comparewith the observation, we further performed hydrodynamic simulations of the CrabSNR for two SN models (Fe-core versus EC) under two SN environments (uniformISM versus progenitor wind). We found that the observed mass limit can becompatible with both SN models if the SN environment has a low density of <~0.03 cm-3 (Fe core) or <~ 0.1 cm-3 (EC) for the uniform density, or aprogenitor wind density somewhat less than that provided by a mass loss rate of10-5 Mo yr-1 at 20 km s-1 for the wind environment.

Measurements of resonant scattering in the Perseus cluster core with  Hitomi SXS

  Thanks to its high spectral resolution (~5 eV at 6 keV), the Soft X-raySpectrometer (SXS) on board Hitomi enables us to measure the detailed structureof spatially resolved emission lines from highly ionized ions in galaxyclusters for the first time. In this series of papers, using the SXS we havemeasured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperaturestructure of the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show thatwhen inferring physical properties from line emissivities in systems likePerseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken into account. Inthe Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He$\alpha$ line ($w$) - thestrongest line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line issuppressed by a factor ~1.3 in the inner ~30 kpc, compared to predictions foran optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases with the distance from thecenter. The $w$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from thesame ion. The observed distortions of the $w$ line flux, shape and distancedependence are all consistent with the expected effect of the resonantscattering in the Perseus core. By measuring the ratio of fluxes in opticallythick ($w$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He$\beta$, Ly$\alpha$) lines, andcomparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfersimulations, the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results areconsistent with the direct measurements of gas velocities from line broadeningdescribed elsewhere in this series, although the systematic and statisticaluncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions ofline emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-raymissions will enable RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on theamplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas motions.
