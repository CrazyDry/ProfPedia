Mathematics of CLIFFORD - A Maple package for Clifford and Grassmann  algebras

  CLIFFORD performs various computations in Grassmann and Clifford algebras. Itcan compute with quaternions, octonions, and matrices with entries in Cl(B) -the Clifford algebra of a vector space V endowed with an arbitrary bilinearform B. Two user-selectable algorithms for Clifford product are implemented:'cmulNUM' - based on Chevalley's recursive formula, and 'cmulRS' - based onnon-recursive Rota-Stein sausage. Grassmann and Clifford bases can be used.Properties of reversion in undotted and dotted wedge bases are discussed.

Grade free product formulae from Grassmann Hopf gebras

  In the traditional approaches to Clifford algebras, the Clifford product isevaluated by recursive application of the product of a one-vector (span of thegenerators) on homogeneous i.e. sums of decomposable (Grassmann), multivectorsand later extended by bilinearity. The Hestenesian 'dot' product, extending theone-vector scalar product, is even worse having exceptions for scalars and theneed for applying grade operators at various times. Moreover, the multivectorgrade is not a generic Clifford algebra concept. The situation becomes evenworse in geometric applications if a meet, join or contractions have to becalculated.  Starting from a naturally graded Grassmann Hopf gebra, we derive generalformulae for the products: meet and join, comeet and cojoin, left/rightcontraction, left/right cocontraction, Clifford and co-Clifford products. Allthese product formulae are valid for any grade and any inhomogeneousmultivector factors in Clifford algebras of any bilinear form, includingnon-symmetric and degenerated forms. We derive the three well known Chevalleyformulae as a specialization of our approach and will display co-Chevalleyformulae. The Rota--Stein cliffordization is shown to be the generalization ofChevalley deformation. Our product formulae are based on invariant theory andare not tied to representations/matrices and are highly computationallyeffective. The method is applicable to symplectic Clifford algebras too.

Fundaments of Quaternionic Clifford Analysis II: Splitting of Equations

  Quaternionic Clifford analysis is a recent new branch of Clifford analysis, ahigher dimensional function theory which refines harmonic analysis andgeneralizes to higher dimension the theory of holomorphic functions in thecomplex plane. So-called quaternionic monogenic functions satisfy a system offirst order linear differential equations expressed in terms of fourinterrelated Dirac operators. The conceptual significance of quaternionicClifford analysis is unraveled by showing that quaternionic monogenicity can becharacterized by means of generalized gradients in the sense of Stein andWeiss. At the same time, connections between quaternionic monogenic functionsand other branches of Clifford analysis, viz Hermitian monogenic and standardor Euclidean monogenic functions are established as well.

Plemelj Projection Operators over Domain Manifolds

  Plemelj projection operators are introduced for spaces of square integrablefunctions defined over the boundaries of a class of compact real n-dimensionalmanifolds lying in C^n. These manifolds posses many properties similar todomains in R^n, and are consequently called domain manifolds. The keyingredients used here are techniques from both real and complex Cliffordanalysis. Analogues of the Kerzman-Stein kernel and Szego projection operatorsar introduced, and their conformal covariance is described.

On the Hopf algebraic origin of Wick normal-ordering

  A combinatorial formula of G.-C. Rota and J.A. Stein is taken to perform Wickre-ordering in quantum field theory. Wick's theorem becomes a Hopf algebraicidentity called Cliffordization. The combinatorial method relying on Hopfalgebras is highly efficient in computations and yields closed algebraicexpressions.  AMS Subject Classifications 2000: 81R50; 16W30

Szeg$\ddot{o}$ projection and matrix Hilbert transform in Hermitean  Clifford analysis

  The simultaneous null solutions of the two complex Hermitean Dirac operatorsare focused on in Hermitean Clifford analysis, where the matrix Hilberttransform was presented and proved to satisfy the analogous properties of theHilbert transform in classical analysis and in orthogonal Clifford analysis.Under this setting we will introduce the Szeg$\ddot{o}$ projection operator forthe Hardy space of Hermitean monogenic functions defined on a bounded subdomainof even dimensional Euclidean space, establish the Kerzman-Stein formula whichclosely connects the Szeg$\ddot{o}$ projection operator with the Hardyprojection operator onto the Hardy space of Hermitean monogenic functionsdefined on a bounded subdomain of even dimensional Euclidean space, and get theSzeg$\ddot{o}$ projection operator in terms of the Hardy projection operatorand its adjoint. Further we will give the algebraic and geometriccharacterizations for the matrix Hilbert transform to be unitary in HermiteanClifford analysis.

Fourier Spectrum Characterizations of Clifford $H^{p}$ Spaces on  $\mathbf{R}^{n+1}_+$ for $1\leq p \leq \infty$

  This article studies the Fourier spectrum characterization of functions inthe Clifford algebra-valued Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbf R^{n+1}_+), 1\leq p\leq\infty.$ Namely, for $f\in L^p(\mathbf R^n)$, Clifford algebra-valued, $f$ isfurther the non-tangential boundary limit of some function in $H^p(\mathbfR^{n+1}_+),$ $1\leq p\leq \infty,$ if and only if $\hat{f}=\chi_+\hat{f},$where $\chi_+(\underline{\xi})=\frac{1}{2}(1+i\frac{\underline \xi}{|\underline\xi|}),$ where the Fourier transformation and the above relation are suitablyinterpreted (for some cases in the distribution sense). These results furtherdevelop the relevant context of Alan McIntosh. As a particular case of ourresults, the vector-valued Clifford Hardy space functions are identical withthe conjugate harmonic systems in the work of Stein and Weiss. The latterproved the corresponding results in terms of the single integral form for thecases $1\leq p<\infty.$

Hermitian Clifford Analysis and Its Connections with Representation  Theory

  This work reconsiders the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic Dirac operators ofHermitian Clifford analysis to determine whether or not they are the naturalgeneralization of the orthogonal Dirac operator to spaces with complexstructure. We argue the generalized gradient construction of Stein and Weissbased on representation theory of Lie groups is the natural way to constructsuch a Dirac-type operator because applied to a Riemannian spin manifold itprovides the Atiyah-Singer Dirac operator. This method, however, does not applyto these Hermitian Dirac operators because the representations of the unitarygroup used are not irreducible, causing problems in considering invarianceunder a group larger than U(n). This motivates either the development ofClifford analysis over a complex vector space with respect to a Hermitian innerproduct or the development of Dirac-type operators on Cauchy-Riemannstructures.

Harmonic, Monogenic and Hypermonogenic Functions on Some Conformally  Flat Manifolds in $R^n$ arising from Special Arithmetic Groups of the Vahlen  Group

  This paper focuses on the development of harmonic and Clifford analysistechniques in the context of some conformally flat manifolds that arise fromfactoring out a simply-connected domain from $R^n$ by special arithmeticsubgroups of the conformal group. Our discussion encompasses in particular theHopf manifold $S^1 \times S^{n-1}$, conformally flat cylinders and tori andsome conformally flat manifolds of genus $g \ge 2$, such as $k$-handled toriand polycylinders. This paper provides a continuation as well as an extensionof our previous two papers \cite{KraRyan1,KraRyan2}. In particular, weintroduce a Cauchy integral formula for hypermonogenic functions on cylinders,tori and on half of the Hopf manifold. These are solutions to the Dirac-Hodgeequation with respect to the hyperbolic metric. We further developgeneralizations of the Mittag-Leffler theorem and the Laurent expansion theoremfor cylindrical and toroidal monogenic functions. The study of Hardy spacedecompositions on the Hopf manifold is also continued. Kerzman-Stein operatorsare introduced. Explicit formulas for the Szeg\"o kernel, the Bergman kerneland the Poisson kernel of half the Hopf manifold are given.

An O(log log m)-competitive Algorithm for Online Machine Minimization

  This paper considers the online machine minimization problem, a basic realtime scheduling problem. The setting for this problem consists of n jobs thatarrive over time, where each job has a deadline by which it must be completed.The goal is to design an online scheduler that feasibly schedules the jobs on anearly minimal number of machines. An algorithm is c-machine optimal if thealgorithm will feasibly schedule a collection of jobs on cm machines if thereexists a feasible schedule on m machines. For over two decades the best knownresult was a O(log P)-machine optimal algorithm, where P is the ratio of themaximum to minimum job size. In a recent breakthrough, a O(log m)-machineoptimal algorithm was given. In this paper, we exponentially improve on thisrecent result by giving a O(log log m)-machine optimal algorithm.

Advance Service Reservations with Heterogeneous Customers

  We study a fundamental model of resource allocation in which a finite numberof resources must be assigned in an online manner to a heterogeneous stream ofcustomers. The customers arrive randomly over time according to knownstochastic processes. Each customer requires a specific amount of capacity andhas a specific preference for each of the resources, with some resources beingfeasible for the customer and some not. The system must find a feasibleassignment of each customer to a resource or must reject the customer. The aimis to maximize the total expected capacity utilization of the resources overthe horizon. This model has application in services, freight transportation,and online advertising. We present online algorithms with bounded competitiveratios relative to an optimal offline algorithm that knows all stochasticinformation. Our algorithms perform extremely well compared to commonheuristics, as demonstrated on a real data set from a large hospital system inNew York City.

Fully Dynamic Matching in Bipartite Graphs

  Maximum cardinality matching in bipartite graphs is an important andwell-studied problem. The fully dynamic version, in which edges are insertedand deleted over time has also been the subject of much attention. Existingalgorithms for dynamic matching (in general graphs) seem to fall into twogroups: there are fast (mostly randomized) algorithms that do not achieve abetter than 2-approximation, and there slow algorithms with $\O(\sqrt{m})$update time that achieve a better-than-2 approximation. Thus the obviousquestion is whether we can design an algorithm -- deterministic or randomized-- that achieves a tradeoff between these two: a $o(\sqrt{m})$ approximationand a better-than-2 approximation simultaneously. We answer this question inthe affirmative for bipartite graphs.  Our main result is a fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $3/2 + \eps$approximation in worst-case update time $O(m^{1/4}\eps^{/2.5})$. We also givestronger results for graphs whose arboricity is at most $\al$, achieving a $(1+\eps)$ approximation in worst-case time $O(\al (\al + \log n))$ for constant$\eps$. When the arboricity is constant, this bound is $O(\log n)$ and when thearboricity is polylogarithmic the update time is also polylogarithmic.  The most important technical developement is the use of an intermediate graphwe call an edge degree constrained subgraph (EDCS). This graph placesconstraints on the sum of the degrees of the endpoints of each edge: upperbounds for matched edges and lower bounds for unmatched edges. The maintechnical content of our paper involves showing both how to maintain an EDCSdynamically and that and EDCS always contains a sufficiently large matching. Wealso make use of graph orientations to help bound the amount of work doneduring each update.

Parallel Graph Connectivity in Log Diameter Rounds

  We study graph connectivity problem in MPC model. On an undirected graph with$n$ nodes and $m$ edges, $O(\log n)$ round connectivity algorithms have beenknown for over 35 years. However, no algorithms with better complexity boundswere known. In this work, we give fully scalable, faster algorithms for theconnectivity problem, by parameterizing the time complexity as a function ofthe diameter of the graph. Our main result is a $O(\log D \log\log_{m/n} n)$time connectivity algorithm for diameter-$D$ graphs, using $\Theta(m)$ totalmemory. If our algorithm can use more memory, it can terminate in fewer rounds,and there is no lower bound on the memory per processor.  We extend our results to related graph problems such as spanning forest,finding a DFS sequence, exact/approximate minimum spanning forest, andbottleneck spanning forest. We also show that achieving similar bounds forreachability in directed graphs would imply faster boolean matrixmultiplication algorithms.  We introduce several new algorithmic ideas. We describe a general techniquecalled double exponential speed problem size reduction which roughly means thatif we can use total memory $N$ to reduce a problem from size $n$ to $n/k$, for$k=(N/n)^{\Theta(1)}$ in one phase, then we can solve the problem in$O(\log\log_{N/n} n)$ phases. In order to achieve this fast reduction for graphconnectivity, we use a multistep algorithm. One key step is a carefullyconstructed truncated broadcasting scheme where each node broadcasts neighborsets to its neighbors in a way that limits the size of the resulting neighborsets. Another key step is random leader contraction, where we choose a smallerset of leaders than many previous works do.
