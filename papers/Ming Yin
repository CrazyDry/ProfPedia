Probing Hamiltonian field redefinition on the nontrivial conformal  algebra

  The compatibility between the conformal symmetry and the closure of conformalalgebras is discussed on the nonlinear sigma model. The present approach, abovethe basis of field redefinition employed in the Hamiltonian scheme, attemptsthe method of quantisation with intuitive picture. As a general field theoretictreatment, the consistency is ensured by means of the interesting featureswhich are observed in the historical studies for the gauge-invariant conformalsymmetry. The identification of conformal anomaly is also shown coincident withthe conventional one approached within the path-integral formulation.

Exploring Network Economics

  In this paper, we explore what \emph{network economics} is all about,focusing on the interesting topics brought about by the Internet. Our intent ismake this a brief survey, useful as an outline for a course on this topic, withan extended list of references. We try to make it as intuitive and readable aspossible. We also deliberately try to be critical at times, and hope ourinterpretation of the topic will lead to interests for further discussions bythose doing research in the same field.

The Finite-time Ruin Probabilities of a Bidimensional risk model with  Constant Interest Force and correlated Brownian Motions

  We follow some recent works to study bidimensional perturbed compound Poissonrisk models with constant interest force and correlated Brownian Motions.Several asymptotic formulae for three different type of ruin probabilities overa finite-time horizon are established.  Our approach appeals directly to very recent developments in the ruin theoryin the presence of heavy tails of unidimensional risk models and the dependencetheory of stochastic processes and random vectors.

Kernel Sparse Subspace Clustering on Symmetric Positive Definite  Manifolds

  Sparse subspace clustering (SSC), as one of the most successful subspaceclustering methods, has achieved notable clustering accuracy in computer visiontasks. However, SSC applies only to vector data in Euclidean space. As such,there is still no satisfactory approach to solve subspace clustering by ${\itself-expressive}$ principle for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matriceswhich is very useful in computer vision. In this paper, by embedding the SPDmatrices into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), a kernel subspaceclustering method is constructed on the SPD manifold through an appropriateLog-Euclidean kernel, termed as kernel sparse subspace clustering on the SPDRiemannian manifold (KSSCR). By exploiting the intrinsic Riemannian geometrywithin data, KSSCR can effectively characterize the geodesic distance betweenSPD matrices to uncover the underlying subspace structure. Experimental resultson two famous database demonstrate that the proposed method achieves betterclustering results than the state-of-the-art approaches.

Neighborhood Preserved Sparse Representation for Robust Classification  on Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices

  Due to its promising classification performance, sparse representation basedclassification(SRC) algorithm has attracted great attention in the past fewyears. However, the existing SRC type methods apply only to vector data inEuclidean space. As such, there is still no satisfactory approach to conductclassification task for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices which isvery useful in computer vision. To address this problem, in this paper, aneighborhood preserved kernel SRC method is proposed on SPD manifolds.Specifically, by embedding the SPD matrices into a Reproducing Kernel HilbertSpace (RKHS), the proposed method can perform classification on SPD manifoldsthrough an appropriate Log-Euclidean kernel. Through exploiting the geodesicdistance between SPD matrices, our method can effectively characterize theintrinsic local Riemannian geometry within data so as to well unravel theunderlying sub-manifold structure. Despite its simplicity, experimental resultson several famous database demonstrate that the proposed method achieves betterclassification results than the state-of-the-art approaches.

Unsupervised Word and Dependency Path Embeddings for Aspect Term  Extraction

  In this paper, we develop a novel approach to aspect term extraction based onunsupervised learning of distributed representations of words and dependencypaths. The basic idea is to connect two words (w1 and w2) with the dependencypath (r) between them in the embedding space. Specifically, our methodoptimizes the objective w1 + r = w2 in the low-dimensional space, where themulti-hop dependency paths are treated as a sequence of grammatical relationsand modeled by a recurrent neural network. Then, we design the embeddingfeatures that consider linear context and dependency context information, forthe conditional random field (CRF) based aspect term extraction. Experimentalresults on the SemEval datasets show that, (1) with only embedding features, wecan achieve state-of-the-art results; (2) our embedding method whichincorporates the syntactic information among words yields better performancethan other representative ones in aspect term extraction.

Low-rank Multi-view Clustering in Third-Order Tensor Space

  The plenty information from multiple views data as well as the complementaryinformation among different views are usually beneficial to various tasks,e.g., clustering, classification, de-noising. Multi-view subspace clustering isbased on the fact that the multi-view data are generated from a latentsubspace. To recover the underlying subspace structure, the success of thesparse and/or low-rank subspace clustering has been witnessed recently. Despitesome state-of-the-art subspace clustering approaches can numerically handlemulti-view data, by simultaneously exploring all possible pairwise correlationwithin views, the high order statistics is often disregarded which can only becaptured by simultaneously utilizing all views. As a consequence, theclustering performance for multi-view data is compromised. To address thisissue, in this paper, a novel multi-view clustering method is proposed by using\textit{t-product} in third-order tensor space. Based on the circularconvolution operation, multi-view data can be effectively represented by a\textit{t-linear} combination with sparse and low-rank penalty using"self-expressiveness". Our extensive experimental results on facial, object,digits image and text data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms thestate-of-the-art methods in terms of many criteria.

A New Look at the Sub-electron Controversy Of Milikan & Ehrenhaft

  The measurements of the electronic charge e, by Ehrenhaft and Millikan in theearly nineteen hundreds generated a bitter controversy between the orthodox andthe atomic points of views. Guided by the Pauli-Fermi neutrino model forbeta-decay in this paper we speculate that the introduction of a smallhypothetical force is adequate to account for most of the contentiousdifferences between the observations of Millikan and Ehrenhaft.

Light (anti-)nuclei production and flow in relativistic heavy-ion  collisions

  Using the coalescence model based on the phase-space distributions ofprotons, neutrons, Lambdas and their antiparticles from a multiphase transport(AMPT) model, we study the production of deuteron, triton, helium 3,hypertriton, hyperhelium 3 and their antinuclei in Pb+Pb collisions at$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The resulting transverse momentum spectra, ellipticflows and coalescence parameters for these nuclei are presented and comparedwith available experimental data. We also show the constituent number scaledelliptic flows of these nuclei and discuss their implications.

Entangling cavity modes in a double-cavity optomechanical system

  We study entanglement of the cavity modes in a double-cavity optomechanicalsystem in strong-coupling regime. The system consists of two optomechanicalsystems coupled by a single photon hopping between them. With the radiationpressure of the photon, entanglement of the cavity modes can be generated. Theconcurrence between the cavity modes is at least twice larger than that betweenthe mechanical modes. Moreover, when we change the ratio between couplingstrength and resonant frequency of mechanical modes, the entanglement in cavityand mechanical modes are influenced differently.

Propagating Profiles of a Chemotaxis Model with Degenerate Diffusion:  Initial Shrinking, Eventual Smoothness and Expanding

  We investigate the propagating profiles of a degenerate chemotaxis modeldescribing the bacteria chemotaxis and consumption of oxygen by aerobicbacteria, in particular, the effect of the initial attractant distribution onbacterial clustering. We prove that the compact support of solutions may shrinkif the signal concentration satisfies a special structure, and show the finitespeed propagating property without assuming the special structure on attractantconcentration, and obtain an explicit formula of the population spreading speedin terms of model parameters. The presented results suggest that bacterialcluster formation can be affected by chemotactic attractants anddensity-dependent dispersal.

One condition for solution uniqueness and robustness of both  l1-synthesis and l1-analysis minimizations

  The $\ell_1$-synthesis model and the $\ell_1$-analysis model recoverstructured signals from their undersampled measurements. The solution of formeris a sparse sum of dictionary atoms, and that of the latter makes sparsecorrelations with dictionary atoms. This paper addresses the question: when canwe trust these models to recover specific signals? We answer the question witha condition that is both necessary and sufficient to guarantee the recovery tobe unique and exact and, in presence of measurement noise, to be robust. Thecondition is one--for--all in the sense that it applies to both of the$\ell_1$-synthesis and $\ell_1$-analysis models, to both of their constrainedand unconstrained formulations, and to both the exact recovery and robustrecovery cases. Furthermore, a convex infinity--norm program is introduced fornumerically verifying the condition. A comprehensive comparison with relatedexisting conditions are included.

Proposal for quantum many-body simulation and torsional matter-wave  interferometry with a levitated nanodiamond

  Hybrid spin-mechanical systems have great potentials in sensing, macroscopicquantum mechanics, and quantum information science. In order to induce strongcoupling between an electron spin and the center-of-mass motion of a mechanicaloscillator, a large magnetic gradient is usually required, which is difficultto achieve. Here we show that strong coupling between the electron spin of anitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and the torsional vibration of an opticallylevitated nanodiamond can be achieved in a uniform magnetic field. Thanks tothe uniform magnetic field, multiple spins can strongly couple to the torsionalvibration at the same time. We propose to utilize this new coupling mechanismto realize the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model by an ensemble of NV centers ina levitated nanodiamond. The quantum phase transition in the LMG model andfinite number effects can be observed with this system. We also propose togenerate torsional superposition states and realize torsional matter-waveinterferometry with spin-torsional coupling.

Coordinate Friendly Structures, Algorithms and Applications

  This paper focuses on coordinate update methods, which are useful for solvingproblems involving large or high-dimensional datasets. They decompose a probleminto simple subproblems, where each updates one, or a small block of, variableswhile fixing others. These methods can deal with linear and nonlinear mappings,smooth and nonsmooth functions, as well as convex and nonconvex problems. Inaddition, they are easy to parallelize.  The great performance of coordinate update methods depends on solving simplesub-problems. To derive simple subproblems for several new classes ofapplications, this paper systematically studies coordinate-friendly operatorsthat perform low-cost coordinate updates.  Based on the discovered coordinate friendly operators, as well as operatorsplitting techniques, we obtain new coordinate update algorithms for a varietyof problems in machine learning, image processing, as well as sub-areas ofoptimization. Several problems are treated with coordinate update for the firsttime in history. The obtained algorithms are scalable to large instancesthrough parallel and even asynchronous computing. We present numerical examplesto illustrate how effective these algorithms are.

Universal driven critical dynamics across a quantum phase transition in  ferromagnetic spinor atomic Bose-Einstein condensates

  We study the equilibrium and dynamical properties of a ferromagnetic spinoratomic Bose-Einstein condensate. In the vicinity of the critical point for acontinuous quantum phase transition, universal behaviors are observed both inthe equilibrium state and in the dynamics when the quadratic Zeeman shift isswept linearly. Three distinct dynamical regions are identified for differentsweeping time scales ($\tau$), when compared to the time scale $\tau_{\rmKZ}\sim N^{(1+\nu z)/\nu d}$ decided by external driving in a system withfinite size $N$ ($\nu,z$ are critical exponents and $d$ the dimensionality).They are manifested by the excitation probability $\mathcal{P}$ and the excessheat density $\mathcal{Q}$. The adiabatic region of$\,\mathcal{P}\sim\mathcal{Q}\sim\tau^{-2}\,$ follows from the adiabaticperturbation theory when $\tau >\tau_{\rm KZ}$, while the non-adiabaticuniversal region of $\,\mathcal{P}\sim\mathcal{Q}\sim\tau^{-1}\,$ in thethermodynamic limit is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism when $\tau_{\rmKZ}>\tau >$ the time scale given by initial gap. The Kibble-Zurek scalinghypothesis is augmented with finite-size scaling in the latter region andseveral experimentally falsifiable features for the finite system we considerare predicted. The region of the fastest sweeping is found to be non-universaland far-from-equilibrium with $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ essentially beingconstants independent of $\tau$.

Universal Direct Proportionality: A New Analysis of Quantum Hall Effect

  We address the researchers studying the magneto-transport properties ofunconventional systems such as bulk samples and new materials or those workingin the soft quantum limit. We have developed a procedure for the analysis ofexperimental data, so as to increase the confidence level about the presence ofquantum hall effect in these data. It is shown that irrespective oftemperature, sample material and sign of the charge carriers, for both integerand fractional QHE's, an universal direct proportionality exists in thedimensionless variables B and R (defined in the text). This procedure does notpreassign, Landau level filling factor (f) but determines both f and carrierdensity in a statistically significant manner. We also find a naturaldefinition of the soft limit regime. Results of the analyses of several sets ofliterature and synthetic data are reported.

Quantum Hall Effect at 40 kelvin: Evidence of MacroscopicQuantization in  the Extreme Soft Limit

  Evidence of both fractional and integer quantum hall effects (QHE) in threedimensional bulk replica opal (250nm diameter) structures of non-crystallinecarbon are presented. In a remarkably soft quantum limit of ~ 40K temperatureand about one tesla of magnetic field clear hall steps, such as n= 2/3, 4/5, 1and others were observed to be coordinated with the minima of longitudinalmagneto-resistance. This behavior is indicative of macroscopic quantumphenomenon associated with electronic condensation into a strongly correlatedquantum liquid (QL). For other systems, such as very high mobility,two-dimensional, electron (hole)-gas or (TDEG) these effects typically ariseunder high magnetic fields (B) and at low temperatures (T), i.e., in theextreme quantum limit (B/T>1). Currently, QHE is applied as calibrationbenchmark, international resistance standard, and a characterization techniquefor semiconductor heterostructures. We believe that applications can bewidespread if the devices and the operating conditions were more accessible.

Experimental Indications of Electro-Gravity

  Recent results from our on going experimental investigation of the influenceof space dependant electric fields on the weight of test particles arereported. Test particles were gold coated metal spheres of same size but ofdifferent masses. Data collected from a number of runs over several yearscontinue to indicate an intriguing effect. For experimental parameters inquestion this effect is manifested as a ppm level sample mass dependent forceadditional to expected electrostatic forces. A force that is proportional tomass is the unique signature of gravity furthermore it is non-zero only whenthe field is applied; hence these observations may be further evidence insupport of electro-gravity.

Exact solution of mean geodesic distance for Vicsek fractals

  The Vicsek fractals are one of the most interesting classes of fractals andthe study of their structural properties is important. In this paper, the exactformula for the mean geodesic distance of Vicsek fractals is found. Thequantity is computed precisely through the recurrence relations derived fromthe self-similar structure of the fractals considered. The obtained exactsolution exhibits that the mean geodesic distance approximately increases as anexponential function of the number of nodes, with the exponent equal to thereciprocal of the fractal dimension. The closed-form solution is confirmed byextensive numerical calculations.

An efficient approach of controlling traffic congestion in scale-free  networks

  We propose and study a model of traffic in communication networks. Theunderlying network has a structure that is tunable between a scale-free growingnetwork with preferential attachments and a random growing network. To modelrealistic situations where different nodes in a network may have differentcapabilities, the message or packet creation and delivering rates at a node areassumed to depend on the degree of the node. Noting that congestions are morelikely to take place at the nodes with high degrees in networks with scale-freecharacter, an efficient approach of selectively enhancing themessage-processing capability of a small fraction (e.g. 3%) of the nodes isshown to perform just as good as enhancing the capability of all nodes. Theinterplay between the creation rate and the delivering rate in determiningnon-congested or congested traffic in a network is studied more numerically andanalytically.

Non-specular Reflective Optics

  Geometrically decorated two-dimensional (2D) discrete surfaces can be moreeffective than conventional smooth reflectors in managing wave radiation.Constructive non-specular wave scattering permits the scattering angle to beother than twice that of incidence and can result in gross violations of thelaw of reflection. Hence significant fraction of the phase space becomesaccessible. A wide range of novel reflective behaviors ensues; including thephenomenon of negative reflection were energy transport remains on the sameside of the normal. Also, at a critical incidence coherent superposition canforce both the transmitted and reflected waves to graze the scattering surfacethus synergistically reinforcing the diffractive process in a behaviorreminiscent of critical internal reflection of ray optics. We experimentallydemonstrate the concept with measurements on a one-dimensionally periodicsystem (grating) where the scattering angle is shown to be an inverse circularfunction of a function that depends on the diffractive index and the twoangles. Excellent agreement is found between experimental data and theory.

Electron-Lattice Systems in Weak Gravitation: The Schiff Dessler Problem

  The behavior of composite matter in external fields can be very revealing.The quantum mechanical problem of a material object (test mass) placed in auniform (weak) gravitational field, g, was considered by many authors startingwith Schiff [Phys. Rev. 151, 1067 (1966)]. Depending on the theoreticaltreatment opposing results of gravity induced (electric) field have beenreported. In the Schiff model [L.I. Schiff, PRB, 1, 4649 (1970)] the field ispredicted to be oriented anti-parallel (with reference to g). On the other handit is found to be parallel in the elastic lattice model [A. J. Dessler et al,Phys.Rev, 168, 737, (1968); Edward Teller, PNAS, 74, 2664 (1977)].Surprisingly, modern researchers have largely overlooked this interestingcontradiction. Here an experimental test is suggested. We also reason thatadvanced density functional type calculations can provide valuable guidance.

Do Quantum Systems Break The Equivalence Principle?

  Gravitational response of real objects is a fascinating topic. Einsteinformalized the Galileo-Newton ideas of equality of free falls into completephysical equivalence or the Principle of Equivalence [Albert Einstein, Themeaning of Relativity, 5 ed. Princeton, (1921)]. However, in this article wepoint out that in a gravitational field, g, the bulk response of anelectrically neutral but atomistic test mass is model dependant. Depending onthe particular quantum approximation scheme, opposing results for the gravityinduced (electric) polarization P have been reported. For instance, P is smalland oriented anti-parallel to g, if the deformations of the positive backgroundlattice is neglected But, it is about ~ 100,1000 times larger and opposite indirection in the elastic lattice approximation. Hence, the elastic modelcontradicts reports of polarization in accelerated metals [Richard C. Tolman &T.Dale Stewart, Phys Rev 28, 794 (1926); G. F. Moorhead & G. I. Opat, Class.Quant. Grav, 13, 3129 (1996)]. Surprisingly, the rigid system is consistentwith EP but the elastic system breaks EP. Here the historical literature issurveyed and some implications are outlined.

Detection of Solar and Lunar Tidal Forces via Non-resonant Oscillations  of A Pendulum

  The FFT power spectrum of time deflection data from a pendulum bob shows abroad structure in the micro-Hz regime is consistent with non-resonant responsedue to forced acceleration. Harmonic analyses of pass Butterworth filtered dataand the horizontal components of the theoretical tidal forces were compared. Weconclude that the observed diurnal and semi-diurnal oscillations with about 10micro-gal amplitude are due to solar and lunar tides. Our results presentedhere clearly indicate that under the appropriate conditions the horizontalforces are also present and have to be accounted for and provide usefulinformation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported detectionof the horizontal tides with a pendulum.

Optimal Power Allocation for OFDM-Based Wire-Tap Channels with  Arbitrarily Distributed Inputs

  In this paper, we investigate power allocation that maximizes the secrecyrate of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems underarbitrarily distributed inputs. Considering commonly assumed Gaussian inputsare unrealistic, we focus on secrecy systems with more practical discretedistributed inputs, such as PSK, QAM, etc. While the secrecy rate achieved byGaussian distributed inputs is concave with respect to the transmit power, wehave found and rigorously proved that the secrecy rate is non-concave under anydiscrete inputs. Hence, traditional convex optimization methods are notapplicable any more. To address this non-concave power allocation problem, wepropose an efficient algorithm. Its gap from optimality vanishes asymptoticallyat the rate of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, and its complexity grows in the order of O(N),where $N$ is the number of sub-carriers. Numerical results are provided toillustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Quantization of the Atom plus Attempting to Answer Heilbron & Kuhn

  The idea of atoms is old but X-rays provided the first probe into thephysical atom. Photographs of X-ray scattering from crystals -Laue spots- werethe first visual proof for the physical existence of atoms arranged in aperfect geometric pattern. Thereby conclusively established the stability andphysical reality of atoms. The Braggs developed Laue technique to study atoms.Moseley applied (Bragg) X-ray spectroscopy to determine the nuclear chargenumber of Rutherford atom. We argue that Bohr also at Manchester andcontemporary of Moseley likely was inspired by Laue discovery to get busy withthe mechanics of the nuclear atom. Roentgens discovery was awarded the firstNobel prize ever in 1901, Laue was honored in 1914, the Braggs in 1915, makingLawrence Bragg then at 25 the youngest ever. Eleven of the cited authors (Bohrhimself included) in the trilogy (but not Nicholson the most cited), were laterrecognized by ten Noble prize awards, seven Laureates in physics and four inchemistry. The ensuing synergy between science and Nobel honors has beencritical.

Optical Monitoring of the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 4151 and Possible  Periodicities in the Historical Light Curve

  We report B, V, and R band CCD photometry of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151obtained with the 1.0-m telescope at Weihai Observatory of Shandong Universityand the 1.56-m telescope at Shanghai Astronomical Observatory from 2005December to 2013 February. Combining all available data from literature, wehave constructed a historical light curve from 1910 to 2013 to study theperiodicity of the source using three different methods (the Jurkevich method,the Lomb-Scargle periodogram method and the Discrete Correlation Functionmethod). We find possible periods of P_1=4\pm0.1, P_2=7.5\pm0.3 andP_3=15.9\pm0.3 yr.

Observation of Piezoelectricity in Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide

  Piezoelectricity offers precise and robust conversion between electricity andmechanical force. Here we report the first experimental evidence ofpiezoelectricity in a single layer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) crystal as aresult of inversion symmetry breaking of the atomic structure, with measuredpiezoelectric coefficient e11 = 2.9e-10 C/m. Through the angular dependence ofelectro-mechanical coupling, we uniquely determined the two-dimensional (2D)crystal orientation. We observed that only MoS2 membranes with odd number oflayers exhibited piezoelectricity, in sharp contrast to the conventionalmaterials. The piezoelectricity discovered in single molecular membranepromises scaling down of nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) to singleatomic unit cell - the ultimate material limit.

Representing data by sparse combination of contextual data points for  classification

  In this paper, we study the problem of using contextual da- ta points of adata point for its classification problem. We propose to represent a data pointas the sparse linear reconstruction of its context, and learn the sparsecontext to gather with a linear classifier in a su- pervised way to increaseits discriminative ability. We proposed a novel formulation for contextlearning, by modeling the learning of context reconstruction coefficients andclassifier in a unified objective. In this objective, the reconstruction erroris minimized and the coefficient spar- sity is encouraged. Moreover, the hingeloss of the classifier is minimized and the complexity of the classifier isreduced. This objective is opti- mized by an alternative strategy in aniterative algorithm. Experiments on three benchmark data set show its advantageover state-of-the-art context-based data representation and classificationmethods.

Supervised learning of sparse context reconstruction coefficients for  data representation and classification

  Context of data points, which is usually defined as the other data points ina data set, has been found to play important roles in data representation andclassification. In this paper, we study the problem of using context of a datapoint for its classification problem. Our work is inspired by the observationthat actually only very few data points are critical in the context of a datapoint for its representation and classification. We propose to represent a datapoint as the sparse linear combination of its context, and learn the sparsecontext in a supervised way to increase its discriminative ability. To thisend, we proposed a novel formulation for context learning, by modeling thelearning of context parameter and classifier in a unified objective, andoptimizing it with an alternative strategy in an iterative algorithm.Experiments on three benchmark data set show its advantage overstate-of-the-art context-based data representation and classification methods.

Elliptic flows of light nuclei

  Using the coalescence model based on nucleons from a blast-wave model withits parameters fitted to the measured proton transverse momentum spectrum andelliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider,we study the elliptic flows of light nuclei in these collisions. We find thatto describe the measured elliptic flows of deuterons (anti-deuterons) andtritons (helium-3) requires that the emission source for nucleons of hightransverse momentum is more elongated along the reaction plane than in theperpendicular direction. Our results thus suggest that the elliptic flows oflight nuclei can be used to study the nucleon emission source in relativisticheavy ion collisions.

Scattering, weak localization and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in high  carrier density AlInN/GaN heterostructures

  We provide the first observation of weak localization in high carrier densitytwo-dimensional electron gas in AlInN/GaN heterostructures; at low temperaturesand low fields the conductivity increases with increasing magnetic field. Weaklocalization is further confirmed by the lnT dependence of the zero-fieldconductivity and angle dependence of magnetoresistance. The inelasticscattering rate is linearly proportional to temperature, demonstrating thatelectron-electron scattering is the principal phase breaking mechanism.Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at high magnetic fields are also observed.From the temperature dependent amplitude of SdH oscillation and Dingle plot,the effective mass of electron is extracted to be 0.2327me; in addition thequantum lifetime is smaller than transport time from Hall measurement,indicating small angle scattering such as from remote ionized impurities isdominant. Above 20 K, the scattering changes from acoustic phonon to opticalphonon scattering, resulting in a rapid decrease in carrier mobility withincreasing temperature.

Early and late stage profiles for a new chemotaxis model with  density-dependent jump probability and quorum-sensing mechanisms

  In this paper, we derive a new chemotaxis model with degenerate diffusion anddensity-dependent chemotactic sensitivity, and we provide a more realisticdescription of cell migration process for its early and late stages. Differentfrom the existing studies focusing on the case of non-degenerate diffusion, thenew model with degenerate diffusion causes us some essential difficulty on theboundedness estimates and the propagation behavior of its compact support. Inthe presence of logistic damping, for the early stage before tumour cellsspread to the whole body, we first estimate the expanding speed of tumourregion as $O(t^{\beta})$ for $0<\beta<\frac{1}{2}$. Then, for the late stage ofcell migration, we further prove that the asymptotic profile of the originalsystem is just its corresponding steady state. The global convergence of theoriginal weak solution to the steady state with exponential rate $O(e^{-ct})$for some $c>0$ is also obtained.

Question Generation from SQL Queries Improves Neural Semantic Parsing

  We study how to learn a semantic parser of state-of-the-art accuracy withless supervised training data. We conduct our study on WikiSQL, the largesthand-annotated semantic parsing dataset to date. First, we demonstrate thatquestion generation is an effective method that empowers us to learn astate-of-the-art neural network based semantic parser with thirty percent ofthe supervised training data. Second, we show that applying question generationto the full supervised training data further improves the state-of-the-artmodel. In addition, we observe that there is a logarithmic relationship betweenthe accuracy of a semantic parser and the amount of training data.

Improving Question Answering by Commonsense-Based Pre-Training

  Although neural network approaches achieve remarkable success on a variety ofNLP tasks, many of them struggle to answer questions that require commonsenseknowledge. We believe the main reason is the lack of commonsense\mbox{connections} between concepts. To remedy this, we provide a simple andeffective method that leverages external commonsense knowledge base such asConceptNet. We pre-train direct and indirect relational functions betweenconcepts, and show that these pre-trained functions could be easily added toexisting neural network models. Results show that incorporatingcommonsense-based function improves the baseline on three question answeringtasks that require commonsense reasoning. Further analysis shows that oursystem \mbox{discovers} and leverages useful evidence from an externalcommonsense knowledge base, which is missing in existing neural network modelsand help derive the correct answer.

Theoretical and numerical studies on global stability of traveling waves  with oscillations for time-delayed nonlocal dispersion equations

  This paper is concerned with the global stability of non-critical/criticaltraveling waves with oscillations for time-delayed nonlocal dispersionequations. We first theoretically prove that all traveling waves, especiallythe critical oscillatory traveling waves, are globally stable in a certainweighted space, where the convergence rates to the non-critical oscillatorytraveling waves are time-exponential, and the convergence to the criticaloscillatory traveling waves are time-algebraic. Both of the rates are optimal.The approach adopted is the weighted energy method with the fundamentalsolution theory for time-delayed equations. Secondly, we carry out numericalcomputations in different cases, which also confirm our theoretical results.Because of oscillations of the solutions and nonlocality of the equation, thenumerical results obtained by the regular finite difference scheme are notstable, even worse to be blow-up. In order to overcome these obstacles, wepropose a new finite difference scheme by adding artificial viscosities to bothsides of the equation, and obtain the desired numerical results.

Working in Pairs: Understanding the Effects of Worker Interactions in  Crowdwork

  Crowdsourcing has gained popularity as a tool to harness human brain power tohelp solve problems that are difficult for computers. Previous work incrowdsourcing often assumes that workers complete crowdwork independently. Inthis paper, we relax the independent property of crowdwork and explore howintroducing direct, synchronous, and free-style interactions between workerswould affect crowdwork. In particular, motivated by the concept of peerinstruction in educational settings, we study the effects of peer communicationin crowdsourcing environments. In the crowdsourcing setting with peercommunication, pairs of workers are asked to complete the same task together byfirst generating their initial answers to the task independently and thenfreely discussing the tasks with each other and updating their answers afterthe discussion. We experimentally examine the effects of peer communication incrowdwork on various common types of tasks on crowdsourcing platforms,including image labeling, optical character recognition (OCR), audiotranscription, and nutrition analysis. Our experiment results show that thework quality is significantly improved in tasks with peer communicationcompared to tasks where workers complete the work independently. However,participating in tasks with peer communication has limited effects oninfluencing worker's independent performance in tasks of the same type in thefuture.

Experimental Demonstration of 503.61-Gbit/s DMT over 10-km 7-Core Fiber  with 1.5-μm SM-VCSEL for Optical Interconnects

  We experimentally demonstrate a net-rate 503.61-Gbit/s discrete multitone(DMT) transmission over 10-km 7-core fiber with 1.5-\mu m single mode VCSEL,where low-complexity kernelrecursive-least-squares algorithm is employed fornonlinear channel equalization.

Self Equivalence of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers

  The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADM or ADMM) breaks acomplex optimization problem into much simpler subproblems. The ADM algorithmsare typically short and easy to implement yet exhibit (nearly) state-of-the-artperformance for large-scale optimization problems.  To apply ADM, we first formulate a given problem into the "ADM-ready" form,so the final algorithm depends on the formulation. A problem like$\mbox{minimize}_\mathbf{x} u(\mathbf{x}) + v(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{x})$ has sixdifferent "ADM-ready" formulations. They can be in the primal or dual forms,and they differ by how dummy variables are introduced. To each "ADM-ready"formulation, ADM can be applied in two different orders depending on how theprimal variables are updated. Finally, we get twelve different ADM algorithms!How do they compare to each other? Which algorithm should one choose?  In this paper, we show that many of the different ways of applying ADM areequivalent. Specifically, we show that ADM applied to a primal formulation isequivalent to ADM applied to its Lagrange dual; ADM is equivalent to aprimal-dual algorithm applied to the saddle-point formulation of the sameproblem. These results are surprising since the primal and dual variables inADM are seemingly treated very differently, and some previous work exhibitpreferences in one over the other on specific problems. In addition, when oneof the two objective functions is quadratic, possibly subject to an affineconstraint, we show that swapping the update order of the two primal variablesin ADM gives the same algorithm. These results identify the few truly differentADM algorithms for a problem, which generally have different forms ofsubproblems from which it is easy to pick one with the most computationallyfriendly subproblems.

Satellite-Based Entanglement Distribution Over 1200 kilometers

  Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential both for foundationaltests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss,however, the previously achieved distance was limited to ~100 km. Here, wedemonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to twolocations separated by 1203 km on the Earth, through satellite-to-groundtwo-downlink with a sum of length varies from 1600 km to 2400 km. We observe asurvival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by2.37+/-0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effectivelink efficiency at 1200 km in this work is over 12 orders of magnitude higherthan the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through the bestcommercial telecommunication fibers with a loss of 0.16 dB/km.

An analysis of the X-ray emission from the supernova remnant 3C397

  The ASCA SIS and the ROSAT PSPC spectral data of the SNR 3C397 are analysedwith a two-component non-equilibrium ionization model. Besides, the ASCA SIS0and SIS1 spectra are also fitted simultaneously in an equilibrium case. Theresulting values of the hydrogen column density yield a distance of $\sim8\kpc$to 3C397. It is found that the hard X-ray emission, containing S and FeK$\alpha$ lines, arises primarily from the hot component, while most of thesoft emission, composed mainly of Mg, Si, Fe L lines, and continuum, isproduced by the cool component. The emission measures suggest that the remnantevolves in a cloudy medium and imply that the supernova progenitor might not bea massive early-type star. The cool component is approaching ionizationequilibrium. The ages estimated from the ionization parameters and dynamics areall much greater than the previous determination. We restore the X-ray mapsusing the ASCA SIS data and compare them with the ROSAT HRI and the NRAO VLASky Survey (NVSS) 20 cm maps. The morphology with two bright concentrationssuggests a bipolar remnant encountering a denser medium in the west.

Influences of degree inhomogeneity on average path length and random  walks in disassortative scale-free networks

  Various real-life networks exhibit degree correlations and heterogeneousstructure, with the latter being characterized by power-law degree distribution$P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$, where the degree exponent $\gamma$ describes the extentof heterogeneity. In this paper, we study analytically the average path length(APL) of and random walks (RWs) on a family of deterministic networks,recursive scale-free trees (RSFTs), with negative degree correlations andvarious $\gamma \in (2,1+\frac{\ln 3}{\ln 2}]$, with an aim to explore theimpacts of structure heterogeneity on APL and RWs. We show that the degreeexponent $\gamma$ has no effect on APL $d$ of RSFTs: In the full range of$\gamma$, $d$ behaves as a logarithmic scaling with the number of network nodes$N$ (i.e. $d \sim \ln N$), which is in sharp contrast to the well-known doublelogarithmic scaling ($d \sim \ln \ln N$) previously obtained for uncorrelatedscale-free networks with $2 \leq \gamma <3$. In addition, we present that somescaling efficiency exponents of random walks are reliant on degree exponent$\gamma$.

Tunable magnetic exchange interactions in manganese-doped inverted  core/shell ZnSe/CdSe nanocrystals

  Magnetic doping of semiconductor nanostructures is actively pursued forapplications in magnetic memory and spin-based electronics. Central to theseefforts is a drive to control the interaction strength between carriers(electrons and holes) and the embedded magnetic atoms. In this respect,colloidal nanocrystal heterostructures provide great flexibility viagrowth-controlled `engineering' of electron and hole wavefunctions withinindividual nanocrystals. Here we demonstrate a widely tunable magnetic sp-dexchange interaction between electron-hole excitations (excitons) andparamagnetic manganese ions using `inverted' core-shell nanocrystals composedof Mn-doped ZnSe cores overcoated with undoped shells of narrower-gap CdSe.Magnetic circular dichroism studies reveal giant Zeeman spin splittings of theband-edge exciton that, surprisingly, are tunable in both magnitude and sign.Effective exciton g-factors are controllably tuned from -200 to +30 solely byincreasing the CdSe shell thickness, demonstrating that strong quantumconfinement and wavefunction engineering in heterostructured nanocrystalmaterials can be utilized to manipulate carrier-Mn wavefunction overlap and thesp-d exchange parameters themselves.

Tidal Accelerometry: Exploring the Cosmos Via Gravitational Correlations

  Newtonian gravitation is non-radiative but is extremely pervasive andpenetrates equally into every media because it cannot be shielded. The extraterrestrial fgravity is responsible for earth's trajectory. However itscorrelation or geodesic deviation is manifested as semi-diurnal and diurnaltides. Tidal signals, A(t) are temporal modulations in the field differentialwhich can be observed in a wide variety of natural and laboratory situations.A(t) is a quasi-static, low frequency signal which arises from the relativechanges in positions of the detector and source and is not part of theelectromagnetic spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to recognize theimportance of tides in astrometry and attempetd to estimate lunar mass fromocean tides. By a case study we show, how the systematics of the gravitationalcorrelation can be used for calibration and de-trending which can significantlyincrease the confidence level of high precision experiments. A(t) can also beused to determine the distribution of celestial masses independently of the"1-2-3" law. Guided by modern advances in gravity wave detectors we argue thatit is important to develop high precision accelerometry. With a resolution ofabout a nano-m it will be possible to determine solar system masses and detectthe SMBH at the center of our galaxy. Observations of the gravitationalcorrelation can potentially open up yet to be explored vistas of the cosmos.

Power Allocation and Time-Domain Artificial Noise Design for Wiretap  OFDM with Discrete Inputs

  Optimal power allocation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM) wiretap channels with Gaussian channel inputs has already been studiedin some previous works from an information theoretical viewpoint. However,these results are not sufficient for practical system design. One reason isthat discrete channel inputs, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)signals, instead of Gaussian channel inputs, are deployed in current practicalwireless systems to maintain moderate peak transmission power and receivercomplexity. In this paper, we investigate the power allocation and artificialnoise design for OFDM wiretap channels with discrete channel inputs. We firstprove that the secrecy rate function for discrete channel inputs is nonconcavewith respect to the transmission power. To resolve the corresponding nonconvexsecrecy rate maximization problem, we develop a low-complexity power allocationalgorithm, which yields a duality gap diminishing in the order ofO(1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of subcarriers of OFDM. We then show thatindependent frequency-domain artificial noise cannot improve the secrecy rateof single-antenna wiretap channels. Towards this end, we propose a noveltime-domain artificial noise design which exploits temporal degrees of freedomprovided by the cyclic prefix of OFDM systems {to jam the eavesdropper andboost the secrecy rate even with a single antenna at the transmitter}.Numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposeddesign schemes.

Landmark-matching Transformation with Large Deformation via  n-dimensional Quasi-conformal Maps

  We propose a new method to obtain landmark-matching transformations betweenn-dimensional Euclidean spaces with large deformations. Given a set of featurecorrespondences, our algorithm searches for an optimal folding-free mappingthat satisfies the prescribed landmark constraints. The standard conformalitydistortion defined for mappings between 2-dimensional spaces is firstgeneralized to the $n$-dimensional conformality distortion $K(f)$ for a mapping$f$ between $n$-dimensional Euclidean spaces $(n \geq 3)$. We then propose avariational model involving $K(f)$ to tackle the landmark-matching problem inhigher dimensional spaces. The generalized conformality term $K(f)$ enforcesthe bijectivity of the optimized mapping and minimizes its local geometricdistortions even with large deformations. Another challenge is the highcomputational cost of the proposed model. To tackle this, we have also proposeda numerical method to solve the optimization problem more efficiently.Alternating direction method with multiplier (ADMM) is applied to split theoptimization problem into two subproblems. Preconditioned conjugate gradientmethod with multi-grid preconditioner is applied to solve one of thesub-problems, while a fixed-point iteration is proposed to solve anothersubproblem. Experiments have been carried out on both synthetic examples andlung CT images to compute the diffeomorphic landmark-matching transformationwith different landmark constraints. Results show the efficacy of our proposedmodel to obtain a folding-free landmark-matching transformation between$n$-dimensional spaces with large deformations.

ARock: an Algorithmic Framework for Asynchronous Parallel Coordinate  Updates

  Finding a fixed point to a nonexpansive operator, i.e., $x^*=Tx^*$, abstractsmany problems in numerical linear algebra, optimization, and other areas ofscientific computing. To solve fixed-point problems, we propose ARock, analgorithmic framework in which multiple agents (machines, processors, or cores)update $x$ in an asynchronous parallel fashion. Asynchrony is crucial toparallel computing since it reduces synchronization wait, relaxes communicationbottleneck, and thus speeds up computing significantly. At each step of ARock,an agent updates a randomly selected coordinate $x_i$ based on possiblyout-of-date information on $x$. The agents share $x$ through either globalmemory or communication. If writing $x_i$ is atomic, the agents can read andwrite $x$ without memory locks.  Theoretically, we show that if the nonexpansive operator $T$ has a fixedpoint, then with probability one, ARock generates a sequence that converges toa fixed points of $T$. Our conditions on $T$ and step sizes are weaker thancomparable work. Linear convergence is also obtained.  We propose special cases of ARock for linear systems, convex optimization,machine learning, as well as distributed and decentralized consensus problems.Numerical experiments of solving sparse logistic regression problems arepresented.

On the Convergence of Asynchronous Parallel Iteration with Unbounded  Delays

  Recent years have witnessed the surge of asynchronous parallel(async-parallel) iterative algorithms due to problems involving verylarge-scale data and a large number of decision variables. Because ofasynchrony, the iterates are computed with outdated information, and the age ofthe outdated information, which we call delay, is the number of times it hasbeen updated since its creation. Almost all recent works prove convergenceunder the assumption of a finite maximum delay and set their stepsizeparameters accordingly. However, the maximum delay is practically unknown.  This paper presents convergence analysis of an async-parallel method from aprobabilistic viewpoint, and it allows for large unbounded delays. An explicitformula of stepsize that guarantees convergence is given depending on delays'statistics. With $p+1$ identical processors, we empirically measured thatdelays closely follow the Poisson distribution with parameter $p$, matching ourtheoretical model, and thus the stepsize can be set accordingly. Simulations onboth convex and nonconvex optimization problems demonstrate the validness ofour analysis and also show that the existing maximum-delay induced stepsize istoo conservative, often slowing down the convergence of the algorithm.

High-resolution and Fully-programmable Microwave-shaper

  We here propose and demonstrate a point-by-point programmable broadbandmicrowave spectrum processor with high-resolution up to tens of MHz. We achievethis by bandwidth-minified mapping a programmable optical spectrum processor,which has much larger bandwidth and lower frequency resolution, to a microwaveone, and make sure the mapping is a similarity transformation. As a comparison,the traditional optical-to-microwave mapping based on super-heterodyne isbandwidth-preserved and identical. Here the optical spectrum processor isfirstly sliced by a high-quality-factor optical resonator, which has periodictransmission peak with MHz-level bandwidth, and then is mapped to microwavedomain by optical-frequency-comb-assisted multi-heterodyne. We demonstrate thehigh frequency resolution and full function reconfigurability experimentally.In a numerical example, we show that the group delay variation of opticalspectrum processor could be greatly enlarged after mapping. The resolutionimprovement and group delay magnification distinguish our proposalsignificantly from previous spectrum mapping from optics to microwave.

Arago Optics: Maximal Confinement of Traveling Waves

  Optics is limited in the 'ray-approximation'-inclusion of wave propertiesresult in additional phenomena and applications; interferometers anddiffraction gratings are two manifestations of such non-geometric, physicaloptics. Incidentally, the most precise measurement ever, at one part per 10^21in the (2017) Nobel winning discovery of gravitational waves was achieved withan interferometer. Amendments to the properties of the medium promise negativerefractive index meta-materials, perfect imaging, light cloaking, and otherultra-natural marvels. Attention to photon phase, correlations, statistics andwavelength independent phase shifts result in singular optics, quantum opticsand anholonomy. Here we present another possibility, namely 'Arago-optics' tomaximize the efficacy of a device by strategically deploying the key qualitiesalong its perimeter. For instance, in conventional sources, waves are generatedwith maximum intensity at the core; whereas in an Arago-source, intensity isminimal or zero at the center, but highest on villus stretches at the margins.We reason that for a given size and energy output, this radiation profile,produces the highest concentration of energy at the focus, with the maximalconfinement of the wave packet. Likewise, the utmost detector resolution isattained when sensitivity is highest on the perimeter and less at the center.This concept holds beyond ultra-focus and Gaussian beams, but generally appliesto beams of 'waves' that show constructive and destructive interference. Theidea is particularly well suited for a fresh integration of geometry andtopology with electronics and materials into real-time wave engineering.
