Learning Interpretable Musical Compositional Rules and Traces

  Throughout music history, theorists have identified and documentedinterpretable rules that capture the decisions of composers. This paper asks,"Can a machine behave like a music theorist?" It presents MUS-ROVER, aself-learning system for automatically discovering rules from symbolic music.MUS-ROVER performs feature learning via $n$-gram models to extractcompositional rules --- statistical patterns over the resulting features. Weevaluate MUS-ROVER on Bach's (SATB) chorales, demonstrating that it can recoverknown rules, as well as identify new, characteristic patterns for furtherstudy. We discuss how the extracted rules can be used in both machine and humancomposition.

Learning Type-Aware Embeddings for Fashion Compatibility

  Outfits in online fashion data are composed of items of many different types(e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with oneanother. A representation for building outfits requires a method that can learnboth notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) andcompatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in anoutfit). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding thatrespects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity andcompatibility in an end-to-end model. To evaluate the learned representation,we crawled 68,306 outfits created by users on the Polyvore website. Ourapproach obtains 3-5% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outfitcompatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as wellas an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of usefulqueries.
