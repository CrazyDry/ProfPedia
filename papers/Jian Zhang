Two-dimensional photonic crystal polarizer

  A novel polarizer made from two-dimensional photonic bandgap materials wasdemonstrated theoretically. This polarizer is fundamentally different from theconventinal ones. It can function in a wide frequency range with highperformance and the size can be made very compact, which renders it useful as amicropolarizer in microoptics.

Emergent Geometry of Matrix Models with Even Couplings

  We show that to the modified GUE partition function with even couplingintroduced by Dubrovin, Liu, Yang and Zhang, one can associate $n$-pointcorrelation functions in arbitrary genera which satisfy Eynard-Orantintopological recursions. Furthermore, these $n$-point functions are related tointersection numbers on the Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces.

Oscillatory Magneto-Thermopower and Resonant Phonon Drag in a  High-Mobility 2D Electron Gas

  Experimental and theoretical evidence is presented for new low-magnetic-field($B<5$ kG) 1/B-oscillations in the thermoelectric power of a high-mobilityGaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional (2D) electron gas. The oscillations result frominter-Landau-Level resonances of acoustic phonons carrying a momentum equal totwice the Fermi wavenumber at $B = 0$. Numerical calculations show that both 3Dand 2D phonons can contribute to this effect.

Semiquantum key distribution using entangled states

  Recently, Boyer et al. presented a novel semiquantum key distributionprotocol [M. Boyer, D. Kenigsberg, and T. Mor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 140501(2007)], by using four quantum states, each of which is randomly prepared by Zbasis or X basis. Here we present a semiquantum key distribution protocol byusing entangled states in which quantum Alice shares a secret key withclassical Bob. We also show the protocol is secure against eavesdropping.

Parallel SGD: When does averaging help?

  Consider a number of workers running SGD independently on the same pool ofdata and averaging the models every once in a while -- a common but not wellunderstood practice. We study model averaging as a variance-reducing mechanismand describe two ways in which the frequency of averaging affects convergence.For convex objectives, we show the benefit of frequent averaging depends on thegradient variance envelope. For non-convex objectives, we illustrate that thisbenefit depends on the presence of multiple globally optimal points. Wecomplement our findings with multicore experiments on both synthetic and realdata.

Combinatorial construction of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules for  $\mathfrak{gl}_n$

  We propose a new effective method of constructing explicitly Gelfand -Tsetlinmodules for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$. We obtain a large family of simple modules thathave a basis consisting of Gelfand-Tsetlin tableaux, the action of the Liealgebra is given by the Gelfand-Tsetlin formulas and with all Gelfand-Tsetlinmultiplicities equal $1$. As an application of our construction we provenecessary and sufficient condition for the Gelfand and Graev's continuationconstruction to define a module which was conjectured by Lemire and Patera.

Geometric modeling of aerosol surface roughness and numerical simulation  of its impact on aerosol optical properties

  A stochastic method is introduced for geometric modeling aerosol surfaceroughness with random field and discrete differential geometry theory. Opticalscattering properties are computed for randomly oriented spheroidal particleswith uniformly random surface roughness. Invariant imbedding T-Matrix andgeometric optics method are applied to compute light scattering properties ofaerosol particles covered from Rayleigh to geometric optics region. Wesimulatied scattering phase matrix of model particles, better performace isobtained than smooth particles. We aslo introduce introduce entropy andrelative entropy as measures to distinguish the optical scattering similaritiesbetween different particles.

Irreducible subquotients of generic gelfand-tsetlin modules over  uq(gl(n))

  We provide a classification and explicit bases of tableaux of all irreduciblesubquotients of generic Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over Uq(gl(n)) where qdifferent 1 and -1.

Multiparameter quantum Pfaffians

  The multiparameter quantum Pfaffian of the $(p, \lambda)$-quantum group isintroduced and studied together with the quantum determinant, and an identityrelating the two invariants is given. Generalization to the multiparameterhyper-Pfaffian and relationship with the quantum minors are also considered.

Generalized Verma modules over U_q(sl_n(C))

  We construct realizations of quantum generalized Verma modules forU_q(sl_n(C)) by quan- tum differential operators. Taking the classical limit q! 1 provides a realization of classical generalized Verma modules for sl_n(C)by differential operators.

Quantum discord and its asymptotic behaviors in a time-dependent XY spin  chain

  We study the dynamics and the asymptotic behaviors of quantum discord in aone-dimensional XY model coupled through time-dependent nearest-neighborinteractions and in the presence of a time-dependent magnetic field. We findthat the time evolution of the nearest-neighbor quantum discord in this systemshows non-ergodic behaviors but is asymptotic to its steady value at thelong-time limit. The zero-temperature asymptotic behaviors of quantum discordis only determined by the ratio between the coupling parameter and magneticfield, whereas the finite-temperature asymptotic behaviors determined by bothof them. These asymptotic behaviors are sensitive not only to the initialvalues of the coupling parameter and magnetic field, but also to the finalvalues. It is interesting to note that quantum discords are more robust thanentanglement against the effect of temperature. We also find particularparameter regimes, where the nearest-neighbor quantum discord is enhancedsignificantly.

Transverse electric current induced by optically injected spin current  in cross-shaped InGaAs/InAlAs system

  We examine electric response of a linearly polarized light normally shed on across-shaped quasi 2-dimensional InGaAs/InAlAs system with structure inversionasymmetry. The photo-excited conduction electrons carry a pure spin currentwith in-plane spin polarization due to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Weuse Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism to show that this spin current induces twoinward or outward transverse charge currents, which are observable inexperiments. This effect may serve as an experimental probe of certain types ofspin current.

Magnetophoresis of nonmagnetic particles in ferrofluids

  Ferrofluids containing nonmagnetic particles are called inverse ferrofluids.On the basis of the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation and the Maxwell-Garnett theory,we theoretically investigate the magnetophoretic force exerting on thenonmagnetic particles in inverse ferrofluids due to the presence of anonuniform magnetic field, by taking into account the structural transition andlong-range interaction. We numerically demonstrate that the force can beadjusted by choosing appropriate lattices, volume fractions, geometric shapes,and conductivities of the nonmagnetic particles, as well as frequencies ofexternal magnetic fields.

Experimental Test of the Kochen-Specker Theorem for Single Qubits using  Positive Operator-Valued Measures

  We present an experimental scheme for the implementation of arbitrarygeneralized measurements, represented by positive-operator valued measures, onthe polarization of single photons, using linear optical devices. Further, weexperimentally test a Kochen-Specker theorem for single qubits using positiveoperator-valued measures. Our experimental results for the first time disprovenon-contextual hidden-variable theories, even for single qubits.

Numerical simulation of Bell inequality's violation using optical  transverse modes in multimode waveguides

  We numerically demonstrate that "mode-entangled states" based on thetransverse modes of classical optical fields in multimode waveguides violateBell's inequality. Numerically simulating the correlation measurement scheme ofBell's inequality, we obtain the normalized correlation functions of theintensity fluctuations for the two entangled classical fields. By using thecorrelation functions, the maximum violations of Bell's inequality areobtained. This implies that the two classical fields in the mode-entangledstates, although spatially separated, present a nonlocal correlation.

Quantum secure direct communication without using perfect quantum  channel

  Most of the quantum secure direct communication protocol needs apre-established secure quantum channel. Only after insuring the security ofquantum channel, could the sender encode the secret message and send them tothe receiver through the secure channel. In this paper, we present a quantumsecure direct communication protocol using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs. It isnot necessary for the present protocol to insure the security of quantumchannel before transmitting the secret message. In the present protocol, allEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs are used to transmit the secret message exceptthose chosen for eavesdropping check.

Quantum signature scheme with single photons

  Quantum digital signature combines quantum theory with classical digitalsignature. The main goal of this field is to take advantage of quantum effectsto provide unconditionally secure signature. We present a quantum signaturescheme with message recovery without using entangle effect. The most importantproperty of the proposed scheme is that it is not necessary for the scheme touse Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The present scheme utilizes singlephotons to achieve the aim of signature and verification. The security of thescheme relies on the quantum one-time pad and quantum key distribution. Theefficiency analysis shows that the proposed scheme is an efficient scheme.

Quantum secure direct communication based on order rearrangement of  single photons

  Based on the ideal of order rearrangement and block transmission of photons,we present a quantum secure direct communication scheme using single photons.The security of the present scheme is ensured by quantum no-cloning theory andthe secret transmitting order of photons. The present scheme is efficient inthat all of the polarized photons are used to transmit the sender's secretmessage except those chosen for eavesdropping check. We also generalize thisscheme to a multiparty controlled quantum secret direct communication schemewhich the sender's secret message can only be recovered by the receiver underthe permission of all the controllers.

Quantum secure direct communication with pure entangled states

  We present a quantum secure direct communication protocol where the channelsare not maximally entangled states. The communication parties utilize decoyphotons to check eavesdropping. After ensuring the security of the quantumchannel, the sender encodes the secret message and transmits it to the receiverby using Controlled-NOT operation and von Neumann measurement. The protocol issimple and realizable with present technology. We also show the protocol issecure for noisy quantum channel.

Holographic bound and protein linguistics

  The holographic bound in physics constrains the complexity of life. Thefinite storage capability of information in the observable universe requiresthe protein linguistics in the evolution of life. We find that the evolution ofgenetic code determines the variance of amino acid frequencies and genomic GCcontent among species. The elegant linguistic mechanism is confirmed by theexperimental observations based on all known entire proteomes.

The holographic principle and the language of genes

  We show that the holographic principle in quantum gravity imposes a strongconstraint on life. The degrees of freedom of an organism can be estimatedaccording to the theory of Boolean networks, which is constrained by theentropy bound. Hence we can explain the languages in protein sequences or inDNA sequences. The overall evolution of biological complexity can beillustrated. And some general properties of protein length distributions can beexplained by a linguistic mechanism.

Prediction of genomic properties and classification of life by protein  length distributions

  Much evolutionary information is stored in the fluctuations of protein lengthdistributions. The genome size and non-coding DNA content can be calculatedbased only on the protein length distributions. So there is intrinsicrelationship between the coding DNA size and non-coding DNA size. According tothe correlations and quasi-periodicity of protein length distributions, we canclassify life into three domains. Strong evidences are found to support theorder in the structures of protein length distributions.

Quantum Quasi-Shuffle Algebras

  We establish some properties of quantum quasi-shuffle algebras. They includethe necessary and sufficient condition for the construction of the quantumquasi-shuffle product, the universal property, and the commutativity condition.As an application, we use the quantum quasi-shuffle product to construct alinear basis of $T(V)$, for a special kind of Yang-Baxter algebras$(V,m,\sigma)$.

Clustering with diversity

  We consider the {\em clustering with diversity} problem: given a set ofcolored points in a metric space, partition them into clusters such that eachcluster has at least $\ell$ points, all of which have distinct colors.  We give a 2-approximation to this problem for any $\ell$ when the objectiveis to minimize the maximum radius of any cluster. We show that theapproximation ratio is optimal unless $\mathbf{P=NP}$, by providing a matchinglower bound. Several extensions to our algorithm have also been developed forhandling outliers. This problem is mainly motivated by applications inprivacy-preserving data publication.

Multiple chiral doublet candidate nucleus $^{105}$Rh in a relativistic  mean-field approach

  Following the reports of two pairs of chiral doublet bands observed in$^{105}$Rh, the adiabatic and configuration-fixed constrained triaxialrelativistic mean-field (RMF) calculations are performed to investigate theirtriaxial deformations with the corresponding configuration and the possiblemultiple chiral doublet (M$\chi$D) phenomenon. The existence of M$\chi$Dphenomenon in $^{105}$Rh is highly expected.

An optimal consensus tracking control algorithm for autonomous  underwater vehicles with disturbances

  The optimal disturbance rejection control problem is considered for consensustracking systems affected by external persistent disturbances and noise.Optimal estimated values of system states are obtained by recursive filteringfor the multiple autonomous underwater vehicles modeled to multi-agent systemswith Kalman filter. Then the feedforward-feedback optimal control law isdeduced by solving the Riccati equations and matrix equations. The existenceand uniqueness condition of feedforward-feedback optimal control law isproposed and the optimal control law algorithm is carried out. Lastly,simulations show the result is effectiveness with respect to externalpersistent disturbances and noise.

Nearly Optimal Bounds for Orthogonal Least Squares

  In this paper, we study the orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm forsparse recovery. On the one hand, we show that if the sampling matrix$\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) of order $K + 1$with isometry constant $$ \delta_{K + 1} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{K+1}}, $$ then OLSexactly recovers the support of any $K$-sparse vector $\mathbf{x}$ from itssamples $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$ in $K$ iterations. On the otherhand, we show that OLS may not be able to recover the support of a $K$-sparsevector $\mathbf{x}$ in $K$ iterations for some $K$ if $$ \delta_{K + 1} \geq\frac{1}{\sqrt{K+\frac{1}{4}}}. $$

Quantum speed limit for a relativistic electron in the noncommutative  phase space

  The influence of the noncommutativity on the average speed of a relativisticelectron interacting with a uniform magnetic field within the minimum evolutiontime is investigated. We find that it is possible for the wave packet of theelectron to travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum because of thenoncommutativity. It suggests that due to the noncommutativity, Lorentzinvariance is violated in the relativistic quantum mechanics region.

On dynamics of quasi-graph maps

  In this paper, we study dynamics of maps on quasi-graphs characterizing theirinvariant measures. In particular, we prove that every invariant measure ofquasi-graph map with zero topological entropy has discrete spectrum. We alsoobtain an analog of Llibre-Misiurewicz's result relating positive topologicalentropy with existence of topological horseshoes.  By these results, Sarnak's M\"obius Disjointness Conjecture restricted to theclass of quasi-graph maps with zero topological entropy is reduced to alreadyknown cases. We prove however, that answering the conjecture for all maps ondendrites with zero topological entropy is equivalent to solving it for alldynamical systems with zero topological entropy.

Quantum Howe duality and invariant polynomials

  We construct two examples of q-deformed classical Howe dual pairs (sl(2,C),sl(2,C)) and (sl(2,C), sl(n,C)). Moreover, we obtain a noncommutative versionof the first fundamental theorem of classical invariant theory. Our approach tothese duality differs from the paper of Lehrer-Zhang-Zhang. Furthermore, wesolve the tensor product decomposition problem for Verma modules overU_q(sl(2,C)) provided q is not a root of unity.

Sieve empirical likelihood ratio tests for nonparametric functions

  Generalized likelihood ratio statistics have been proposed in Fan, Zhang andZhang [Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 153-193] as a generally applicable method fortesting nonparametric hypotheses about nonparametric functions. The likelihoodratio statistics are constructed based on the assumption that the distributionsof stochastic errors are in a certain parametric family. We extend their workto the case where the error distribution is completely unspecified via newlyproposed sieve empirical likelihood ratio (SELR) tests. The approach is alsoapplied to test conditional estimating equations on the distributions ofstochastic errors. It is shown that the proposed SELR statistics followasymptotically rescaled \chi^2-distributions, with the scale constants and thedegrees of freedom being independent of the nuisance parameters. Thisdemonstrates that the Wilks phenomenon observed in Fan, Zhang and Zhang [Ann.Statist. 29 (2001) 153-193] continues to hold under more relaxed models and alarger class of techniques. The asymptotic power of the proposed test is alsoderived, which achieves the optimal rate for nonparametric hypothesis testing.The proposed approach has two advantages over the generalized likelihood ratiomethod: it requires one only to specify some conditional estimating equationsrather than the entire distribution of the stochastic error, and the procedureadapts automatically to the unknown error distribution includingheteroscedasticity. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate our proposedprocedure empirically.

Unveiling the super-orbital modulation of LSI +61 303 in X-rays

  We found evidence for the super-orbital modulation in the X-ray emission ofLS I +61 303 from the longest monitoring date by the RXTE. The time evolutionof the modulated fraction in the orbital light curves can be well fitted with asinusoidal function having a super-orbital period of 1667 days. However, wehave found a 281.8+/-44.6 day shift between the super-orbital variability foundat radio frequencies and our X-ray data. We also find a super-orbitalmodulation in the maximum count rate of the orbital light curves, compatiblewith the former results, including the shift.

Ultrahigh Magnetic Fields Produced by Shearing Carbon Nanotubes

  In laboratories, ultrahigh magnetic fields are usually produced with verylarge currents through superconducting, resistive or hybrid magnets, whichrequire extreme conditions, such as low temperature, huge cooling water or tensof megawatts of power. In this work we report that when single walled carbonnanotubes (SWNTs) are cut, there are magnetic moments at the shearing end ofSWNTs. The average magnetic moment is found to be 41.5+-9.8uB per carbon atomin the end states with a width of 1 nm at temperature of 300.0K, suggestingultrahigh magnetic fields can be produced. The dangling sigma and pi bonds ofthe carbon atoms at the shearing ends play important roles for thisunexpectedly high magnetic moments because the oxidation temperature of cutSWNTs is found to be as low as 312 in dry air. Producing ultrahigh magneticfield with SWNTs has the advantage of working at higher working temperature andwith low energy consumption, suggesting great potentials of applications.

Disorder induced quantized conductance with fractional value and  universal conductance fluctuation in three-dimensional topological insulators

  We report a theoretical investigation on the conductance and its fluctuationof three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TI) in $Bi_2Se_3$ and$Sb_2Te_3$ in the presence of disorders. Extensive numerical simulations arecarried out. We find that in the diffusive regime the conductance is quantizedwith fractional value. Importantly, the conductance fluctuation is alsoquantized with a universal value. For 3D TI connected by two terminals, threeindependent conductances $G_{zz}$, $G_{xx}$ and $G_{zx}$ are identified where zis the normal direction of quintuple layer of 3D TI (see inset of Fig.1). Thequantized conductance are found to be $<G_{zz}>=1$, $<G_{xx}>=4/3$ and$<G_{zx}>=6/5$ with corresponding quantized conductance fluctuation 0.54, 0.47,and 0.50. The quantization of average conductance and its fluctuation can beunderstood by theory of mode mixing. The experimental realization that canobserve the quantization of average conductance is discussed.

Compressed Sensing SAR Imaging with Multilook Processing

  Multilook processing is a widely used speckle reduction approach in syntheticaperture radar (SAR) imaging. Conventionally, it is achieved by incoherentlysumming of some independent low-resolution images formulated from overlappingsubbands of the SAR signal. However, in the context of compressive sensing (CS)SAR imaging, where the samples are collected at sub-Nyquist rate, the dataspectrum is highly aliased that hinders the direct application of the existingmultilook techniques. In this letter, we propose a new CS-SAR imaging methodthat can realize multilook processing simultaneously during imagereconstruction. The main idea is to replace the SAR observation matrix by theinverse of multilook procedures, which is then combined with random samplingmatrix to yield a multilook CS-SAR observation model. Then a joint sparseregularization model, considering pixel dependency of subimages, is derived toform multilook images. The suggested SAR imaging method can not onlyreconstruct sparse scene efficiently below Nyquist rate, but is also able toachieve a comparable reduction of speckles during reconstruction. Simulationresults are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposedmethod.

Quantum coherence across bosonic superconductor-anomalous  metal-insulator transitions

  After decades of explorations, suffering from low critical temperature andsubtle nature, whether a metallic ground state exists in a two-dimensionalsystem beyond Anderson localization is still a mystery. Supremely, phasecoherence could be the key that unlocks its intriguing nature. This workreveals how quantum phase coherence evolves across bosonicsuperconductor-metal-insulator transitions via magneto-conductance quantumoscillations in high-Tc superconducting films. A robust intervening anomalousmetallic state characterized by both resistance and oscillation amplitudesaturations in the low temperature regime is detected. By contrast, withdecreasing temperature the oscillation amplitude monotonically grows on thesuperconducting side, but decreases at low temperatures on the insulating side.It suggests that the saturation of phase coherence plays a prominent role inthe formation of this anomalous metallic state.

Forward-backward systems for expected utility maximization

  In this paper we deal with the utility maximization problem with a generalutility function. We derive a new approach in which we reduce the utilitymaximization problem with general utility to the study of a fully-coupledForward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE).

A local equivariant index theorem for sub-signature operators

  In this paper, we prove a local equivariant index theorem for sub-signatureoperators which generalizes the Zhang's index theorem for sub-signatureoperators.

Explicit construction of irreducible modules for U_q(gl_n)

  We construct new families of U_q(gl_n)-modules by continuation from finitedimensional representations. Each such module is associated with acombinatorial object - admissible set of relations defined in \cite{FRZ}. Moreprecisely, we prove that any admissible set of relations leads to a family ofirreducible U_q(gl_n)-modules. Finite dimensional and generic modules areparticular cases of this construction.

Nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulae for SPDEs with space-time noise

  We study a class of backward doubly stochastic differential equations(BDSDEs) involving martingales with spatial parameters, and show that theyprovide probabilistic interpretations (Feynman-Kac formulae) for certainsemilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with space-timenoise. As an application of the Feynman-Kac formulae, random periodic solutionsand stationary solutions to certain SPDEs are obtained.

A question of Norton-Sullivan in the analytic case

  In 1996, A. Norton and D. Sullivan asked the following question: If$f:\mathbb{T}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{T}^2$ is a diffeomorphism,$h:\mathbb{T}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{T}^2$ is a continuous map homotopic to theidentity, and $h f=T_{\rho} h$ where $\rho\in\mathbb{R}^2$ is a totallyirrational vector and $T_{\rho}:\mathbb{T}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{T}^2,\, z\mapstoz+\rho$ is a translation, are there natural geometric conditions (e.g.smoothness) on $f$ that force $h$ to be a homeomorphism? In [ J. Wang and Z.Zhang, GAFA 2018 ], the first author and Z. Zhang gave a negative answer to theabove question in the $C^{\infty}$ category: In general, not even the infinitesmoothness condition can force $h$ to be a homeomorphism. In this article, wegive a negative answer in the $C^{\omega}$ category: We construct areal-analytic conservative and minimal totally irrational pseudo-rotation of$\mathbb{T}^2$ that is semi-conjugate to a translation but not conjugate to atranslation, which simultaneously answers a question raised in [ J. Wang and Z.Zhang, GAFA 2018 ].

Fast Compressed Sensing SAR Imaging based on Approximated Observation

  In recent years, compressed sensing (CS) has been applied in the field ofsynthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging and shows great potential. The existingmodels are, however, based on application of the sensing matrix acquired by theexact observation functions. As a result, the corresponding reconstructionalgorithms are much more time consuming than traditional matched filter (MF)based focusing methods, especially in high resolution and wide swath systems.In this paper, we formulate a new CS-SAR imaging model based on the use of theapproximated SAR observation deducted from the inverse of focusing procedures.We incorporate CS and MF within an sparse regularization framework that is thensolved by a fast iterative thresholding algorithm. The proposed model forms anew CS-SAR imaging method that can be applied to high-quality andhigh-resolution imaging under sub-Nyquist rate sampling, while saving thecomputational cost substantially both in time and memory. Simulations and realSAR data applications support that the proposed method can perform SAR imagingeffectively and efficiently under Nyquist rate, especially for large scaleapplications.

Superconductivity in topologically nontrivial material Au2Pb

  The search for nontrivial superconductivity in novel quantum materials iscurrently a most attractive topic in condensed matter physics and materialscience. The experimental studies have progressed quickly over the past coupleof years. In this article, we report systematic studies of superconductivity inAu2Pb single crystals. The bulk superconductivity (onset transitiontemperature, Tconset= 1.3 K) of Au2Pb is characterized by both transport anddiamagnetic measurements, where the upper critical field Hc2 shows unusualquasi-linear temperature dependence. The superconducting gap is revealed bypoint contact measurement with gold tip. However, when using tungsten (W) tip,which is much harder, the superconducting gap probed is largely enhanced asdemonstrated by the increases of both Tconset and upper critical field (Hc2).This can be interpreted as a result of increase in density of states underexternal anisotropic stress imposed by the tip, as revealed by first-principlescalculations. Furthermore, novel phase winding of the pseudospin texture alongk-space loops around the Fermi energy is uncovered from the calculations,indicating that the observed superconductivity in Au2Pb may have nontrivialtopology.

Collaboration in an Open Data eScience: A Case Study of Sloan Digital  Sky Survey

  Current science and technology has produced more and more publicallyaccessible scientific data. However, little is known about how the open datatrend impacts a scientific community, specifically in terms of itscollaboration behaviors. This paper aims to enhance our understanding of thedynamics of scientific collaboration in the open data eScience environment viaa case study of co-author networks of an active and highly cited open dataproject, called Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We visualized the co-authoringnetworks and measured their properties over time at three levels: author,institution, and country levels. We compared these measurements to a randomnetwork model and also compared results across the three levels. The studyfound that 1) the collaboration networks of the SDSS community transformed fromrandom networks to small-world networks; 2) the number of author-levelcollaboration instances has not changed much over time, while the number ofcollaboration instances at the other two levels has increased over time; 3)pairwise institutional collaboration become common in recent years. The opendata trend may have both positive and negative impacts on scientificcollaboration.

FBSDE with time delayed generators: Lp-solutions, differentiability,  representation formulas and path regularity

  We extend the work of Delong and Imkeller (2010a,b) concerning Backwardstochastic differential equations with time delayed generators (delay BSDE). Wegive moment and a priori estimates in general $L^p$-spaces and providesufficient conditions for the solution of a delay BSDE to exist in $L^p$. Weintroduce decoupled systems of SDE and delay BSDE (delay FBSDE) and givesufficient conditions for their variational differentiability. We connect thesevariational derivatives to the Malliavin derivatives of delay FBSDE via theusual representation formulas. We conclude with several path regularityresults, in particular we extend the classic $L^2$-path regularity to delayFBSDE.

Semiquantum secret sharing using two-particle entangled state

  Recently, Boyer et al. presented a novel semiquantum key distributionprotocol [M. Boyer, D. Kenigsberg, and T. Mor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 140501(2007)], in which quantum Alice shares a secret key with classical Bob. Li etal. proposed two semiquantum secret sharing protocols [Q. Li, W. H. Chan, andD. Y. Long, Phys. Rev. A 82, 022303 (2010)] by using maximally entangledGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. In this paper, we present a semiquantumsecret sharing protocol by using two-particle entangled states in which quantumAlice shares a secret key with two classical parties, Bob and Charlie.Classical Bob and Charlie are restricted to performing measurement in thecomputational basis, preparing a particle in the computational basis, orreflecting the particles. None of them can acquire the secret unless theycollaborate. We also show the protocol is secure against eavesdropping.
