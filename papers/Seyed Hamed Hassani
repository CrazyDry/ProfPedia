On the scaling of Polar Codes: II. The behavior of un-polarized channels

  We provide upper and lower bounds on the escape rate of the Bhattacharyyaprocess corresponding to polar codes and transmission over the the binaryerasure channel. More precisely, we bound the exponent of the number ofsub-channels whose Bhattacharyya constant falls in a fixed interval $[a,b]$.Mathematically this can be stated as bounding the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{n} \ln \mathbb{P}(Z_n \in [a,b])$, where $Z_n$ is the Bhattacharyyaprocess. The quantity $\mathbb{P}(Z_n \in [a,b])$ represents the fraction ofsub-channels that are still un-polarized at time $n$.

Coupled Graphical Models and Their Thresholds

  The excellent performance of convolutional low-density parity-check codes isthe result of the spatial coupling of individual underlying codes across awindow of growing size, but much smaller than the length of the individualcodes. Remarkably, the belief-propagation threshold of the coupled ensemble isboosted to the maximum-a-posteriori one of the individual system. Weinvestigate the generality of this phenomenon beyond coding theory: we couplegeneral graphical models into a one-dimensional chain of large individualsystems. For the later we take the Curie-Weiss, random field Curie-Weiss,$K$-satisfiability, and $Q$-coloring models. We always find, based onanalytical as well as numerical calculations, that the message passingthresholds of the coupled systems come very close to the static ones of theindividual models. The remarkable properties of convolutional low-densityparity-check codes are a manifestation of this very general phenomenon.

Rate-Dependent Analysis of the Asymptotic Behavior of Channel  Polarization

  For a binary-input memoryless symmetric channel $W$, we consider theasymptotic behavior of the polarization process in the large block-lengthregime when transmission takes place over $W$. In particular, we study theasymptotics of the cumulative distribution $\mathbb{P}(Z_n \leq z)$, where$\{Z_n\}$ is the Bhattacharyya process defined from $W$, and its dependence onthe rate of transmission. On the basis of this result, we characterize theasymptotic behavior, as well as its dependence on the rate, of the block errorprobability of polar codes using the successive cancellation decoder. Thisrefines the original bounds by Ar{\i}kan and Telatar. Our results apply togeneral polar codes based on $\ell \times \ell$ kernel matrices.  We also provide lower bounds on the block error probability of polar codesusing the MAP decoder. The MAP lower bound and the successive cancellationupper bound coincide when $\ell=2$, but there is a gap for $\ell>2$.

Threshold Saturation in Spatially Coupled Constraint Satisfaction  Problems

  We consider chains of random constraint satisfaction models that arespatially coupled across a finite window along the chain direction. Weinvestigate their phase diagram at zero temperature using the surveypropagation formalism and the interpolation method. We prove that the SAT-UNSATphase transition threshold of an infinite chain is identical to the one of theindividual standard model, and is therefore not affected by spatial coupling.We compute the survey propagation complexity using population dynamics as wellas large degree approximations, and determine the survey propagation threshold.We find that a clustering phase survives coupling. However, as one increasesthe range of the coupling window, the survey propagation threshold increasesand saturates towards the phase transition threshold. We also briefly discussother aspects of the problem. Namely, the condensation threshold is notaffected by coupling, but the dynamic threshold displays saturation towards thecondensation one. All these features may provide a new avenue for obtainingbetter provable algorithmic lower bounds on phase transition thresholds of theindividual standard model.

Universal Bounds on the Scaling Behavior of Polar Codes

  We consider the problem of determining the trade-off between the rate and theblock-length of polar codes for a given block error probability when we use thesuccessive cancellation decoder. We take the sum of the Bhattacharyyaparameters as a proxy for the block error probability, and show that thereexists a universal parameter $\mu$ such that for any binary memorylesssymmetric channel $W$ with capacity $I(W)$, reliable communication requiresrates that satisfy $R< I(W)-\alpha N^{-\frac{1}{\mu}}$, where $\alpha$ is apositive constant and $N$ is the block-length. We provide lower bounds on$\mu$, namely $\mu \geq 3.553$, and we conjecture that indeed $\mu=3.627$, theparameter for the binary erasure channel.

On the Construction of Polar Codes

  We consider the problem of efficiently constructing polar codes over binarymemoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. The complexity of designing polar codesvia an exact evaluation of the polarized channels to find which ones are "good"appears to be exponential in the block length. In \cite{TV11}, Tal and Vardyshow that if instead the evaluation if performed approximately, theconstruction has only linear complexity. In this paper, we follow this approachand present a framework where the algorithms of \cite{TV11} and new relatedalgorithms can be analyzed for complexity and accuracy. We provide numericaland analytical results on the efficiency of such algorithms, in particular weshow that one can find all the "good" channels (except a vanishing fraction)with almost linear complexity in block-length (except a polylogarithmicfactor).

Polar Codes: Robustness of the Successive Cancellation Decoder with  Respect to Quantization

  Polar codes provably achieve the capacity of a wide array of channels undersuccessive decoding. This assumes infinite precision arithmetic. Given thesuccessive nature of the decoding algorithm, one might worry about thesensitivity of the performance to the precision of the computation.  We show that even very coarsely quantized decoding algorithms lead toexcellent performance. More concretely, we show that under successive decodingwith an alphabet of cardinality only three, the decoder still has a thresholdand this threshold is a sizable fraction of capacity. More generally, we showthat if we are willing to transmit at a rate $\delta$ below capacity, then weneed only $c \log(1/\delta)$ bits of precision, where $c$ is a universalconstant.

The Space of Solutions of Coupled XORSAT Formulae

  The XOR-satisfiability (XORSAT) problem deals with a system of $n$ Booleanvariables and $m$ clauses. Each clause is a linear Boolean equation (XOR) of asubset of the variables. A $K$-clause is a clause involving $K$ distinctvariables. In the random $K$-XORSAT problem a formula is created by choosing$m$ $K$-clauses uniformly at random from the set of all possible clauses on $n$variables. The set of solutions of a random formula exhibits variousgeometrical transitions as the ratio $\frac{m}{n}$ varies.  We consider a {\em coupled} $K$-XORSAT ensemble, consisting of a chain ofrandom XORSAT models that are spatially coupled across a finite window alongthe chain direction. We observe that the threshold saturation phenomenon takesplace for this ensemble and we characterize various properties of the space ofsolutions of such coupled formulae.

On the scaling of Polar codes: I. The behavior of polarized channels

  We consider the asymptotic behavior of the polarization process for polarcodes when the blocklength tends to infinity. In particular, we study theproblem of asymptotic analysis of the cumulative distribution $\mathbb{P}(Z_n\leq z)$, where $Z_n=Z(W_n)$ is the Bhattacharyya process, and its dependenceto the rate of transmission R. We show that for a BMS channel $W$, for $R <I(W)$ we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P} (Z_n \leq2^{-2^{\frac{n}{2}+\sqrt{n} \frac{Q^{-1}(\frac{R}{I(W)})}{2} +o(\sqrt{n})}}) =R$ and for $R<1- I(W)$ we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P} (Z_n \geq1-2^{-2^{\frac{n}{2}+ \sqrt{n} \frac{Q^{-1}(\frac{R}{1-I(W)})}{2}+o(\sqrt{n})}}) = R$, where $Q(x)$ is the probability that a standard normalrandom variable will obtain a value larger than $x$. As a result, if we denoteby $\mathbb{P}_e ^{\text{SC}}(n,R)$ the probability of error using polar codesof block-length $N=2^n$ and rate $R<I(W)$ under successive cancellationdecoding, then $\log(-\log(\mathbb{P}_e ^{\text{SC}}(n,R)))$ scales as$\frac{n}{2}+\sqrt{n}\frac{Q^{-1}(\frac{R}{I(W)})}{2}+ o(\sqrt{n})$. We alsoprove that the same result holds for the block error probability using the MAPdecoder, i.e., for $\log(-\log(\mathbb{P}_e ^{\text{MAP}}(n,R)))$.

Near concavity of the growth rate for coupled LDPC chains

  Convolutional Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) ensembles have excellentperformance. Their iterative threshold increases with their average degree, orwith the size of the coupling window in randomized constructions. In the latercase, as the window size grows, the Belief Propagation (BP) threshold attainsthe maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. In thiscontribution we show that a similar phenomenon happens for the growth rate ofcoupled ensembles. Loosely speaking, we observe that as the coupling strengthgrows, the growth rate of the coupled ensemble comes close to the concave hullof the underlying ensemble's growth rate. For ensembles randomly coupled acrossa window the growth rate actually tends to the concave hull of the underlyingone as the window size increases. Our observations are supported by thecalculations of the combinatorial growth rate, and that of the growth ratederived from the replica method. The observed concavity is a general feature ofcoupled mean field graphical models and is already present at the level ofcoupled Curie-Weiss models. There, the canonical free energy of the coupledsystem tends to the concave hull of the underlying one. As we explain, thebehavior of the growth rate of coupled ensembles is exactly analogous.

Chains of Mean Field Models

  We consider a collection of Curie-Weiss (CW) spin systems, possibly with arandom field, each of which is placed along the positions of a one-dimensionalchain. The CW systems are coupled together by a Kac-type interaction in thelongitudinal direction of the chain and by an infinite range interaction in thedirection transverse to the chain. Our motivations for studying this model comefrom recent findings in the theory of error correcting codes based on spatiallycoupled graphs. We find that, although much simpler than the codes, the modelstudied here already displays similar behaviors. We are interested in the vander Waals curve in a regime where the size of each Curie-Weiss model tends toinfinity, and the length of the chain and range of the Kac interaction arelarge but finite. Below the critical temperature, and with appropriate boundaryconditions, there appears a series of equilibrium states representing kink-likeinterfaces between the two equilibrium states of the individual system. The vander Waals curve oscillates periodically around the Maxwell plateau. Theseoscillations have a period inversely proportional to the chain length and anamplitude exponentially small in the range of the interaction; in other wordsthe spinodal points of the chain model lie exponentially close to the phasetransition threshold. The amplitude of the oscillations is closely related to aPeierls-Nabarro free energy barrier for the motion of the kink along the chain.Analogies to similar phenomena and their possible algorithmic significance forgraphical models of interest in coding theory and theoretical computer scienceare pointed out.

Finite-Length Scaling of Polar Codes

  Consider a binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channel $W$. Such achannel has a capacity, call it $I(W)$, and for any $R<I(W)$ and strictlypositive constant $P_{\rm e}$ we know that we can construct a coding schemethat allows transmission at rate $R$ with an error probability not exceeding$P_{\rm e}$. Assume now that we let the rate $R$ tend to $I(W)$ and we ask howwe have to "scale" the blocklength $N$ in order to keep the error probabilityfixed to $P_{\rm e}$. We refer to this as the "finite-length scaling" behavior.This question was addressed by Strassen as well as Polyanskiy, Poor and Verdu,and the result is that $N$ must grow at least as the square of the reciprocalof $I(W)-R$.  Polar codes are optimal in the sense that they achieve capacity. In thispaper, we are asking to what degree they are also optimal in terms of theirfinite-length behavior. Our approach is based on analyzing the dynamics of theun-polarized channels. The main results of this paper can be summarized asfollows. Consider the sum of Bhattacharyya parameters of sub-channels chosen(by the polar coding scheme) to transmit information. If we require this sum tobe smaller than a given value $P_{\rm e}>0$, then the required block-length $N$scales in terms of the rate $R < I(W)$ as $N \geq\frac{\alpha}{(I(W)-R)^{\underline{\mu}}}$, where $\alpha$ is a positiveconstant that depends on $P_{\rm e}$ and $I(W)$, and $\underline{\mu} = 3.579$.Also, we show that with the same requirement on the sum of Bhattacharyyaparameters, the block-length scales in terms of the rate like $N \leq\frac{\beta}{(I(W)-R)^{\overline{\mu}}}$, where $\beta$ is a constant thatdepends on $P_{\rm e}$ and $I(W)$, and $\overline{\mu}=6$.

Universal Polar Codes

  Polar codes, invented by Arikan in 2009, are known to achieve the capacity ofany binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channel. One of the few drawbacksof the original polar code construction is that it is not universal. This meansthat the code has to be tailored to the channel if we want to transmit close tocapacity.  We present two "polar-like" schemes which are capable of achieving thecompound capacity of the whole class of binary-input memorylessoutput-symmetric channels with low complexity.  Roughly speaking, for the first scheme we stack up $N$ polar blocks of length$N$ on top of each other but shift them with respect to each other so that theyform a "staircase." Coding then across the columns of this staircase with astandard Reed-Solomon code, we can achieve the compound capacity using astandard successive decoder to process the rows (the polar codes) and inaddition a standard Reed-Solomon erasure decoder to process the columns.Compared to standard polar codes this scheme has essentially the samecomplexity per bit but a block length which is larger by a factor $O(N\log_2(N)/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the gap to capacity.  For the second scheme we first show how to construct a true polar code whichachieves the compound capacity for a finite number of channels. We achieve thisby introducing special "polarization" steps which "align" the good indices forthe various channels. We then show how to exploit the compactness of the spaceof binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels to reduce the compoundcapacity problem for this class to a compound capacity problem for a finite setof channels. This scheme is similar in spirit to standard polar codes, but theprice for universality is a considerably larger blocklength.  We close with what we consider to be some interesting open problems.
