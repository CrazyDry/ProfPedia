Optimal Rectangle Packing: An Absolute Placement Approach

  We consider the problem of finding all enclosing rectangles of minimum areathat can contain a given set of rectangles without overlap. Our rectanglepacker chooses the x-coordinates of all the rectangles before any of they-coordinates. We then transform the problem into a perfect-packing problemwith no empty space by adding additional rectangles. To determine they-coordinates, we branch on the different rectangles that can be placed in eachempty position. Our packer allows us to extend the known solutions for aconsecutive-square benchmark from 27 to 32 squares. We also introduce three newbenchmarks, avoiding properties that make a benchmark easy, such as rectangleswith shared dimensions. Our third benchmark consists of rectangles ofincreasingly high precision. To pack them efficiently, we limit the rectanglescoordinates and the bounding box dimensions to the set of subset sums of therectangles dimensions. Overall, our algorithms represent the currentstate-of-the-art for this problem, outperforming other algorithms by orders ofmagnitude, depending on the benchmark.
