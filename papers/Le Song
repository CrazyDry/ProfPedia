On Lp Estimates in Homogenization of Elliptic Equations of Maxwell's  Type

  For a family of second-order elliptic systems of Maxwell's type with rapidlyoscillating periodic coefficients in a $C^{1, \alpha}$ domain $\Omega$, weestablish uniform estimates of solutions $u_\varep$ and $\nabla \timesu_\varep$ in $L^p(\Omega)$ for $1<p\le \infty$. The proof relies on the uniform$W^{1,p}$ and Lipschitz estimates for solutions of scalar elliptic equationswith periodic coefficients.

Regularity of structure sheaves of varieties with isolated singularities

  Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^N$ be a non-degenerate normal projective varietyof codimension $e$ and degree $d$ with isolated $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorensteinsingularities. We prove that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity$\text{reg}(\mathcal{O}_{X})\le d-e$, as predicted by the Eisenbud-Gotoconjecture. Then we classify the extremal and the next to extremal cases.

Topological correspondence of multiple ergodic averages of nilpotent  group actions

  Let $(X,\Gamma)$ be a topological system, where $\Gamma$ is a nilpotent groupgenerated by $T_1,\ldots, T_d$ such that for each $T\in \Gamma$, $T\neqe_\Gamma$, $(X,T)$ is weakly mixing and minimal. For $d,k\in \mathbb{N}$, let$p_{i,j}(n), 1\le i\le k, 1\le j\le d$ be polynomials with rationalcoefficients taking integer values on the integers and $p_{i,j}(0)=0$. We showthat if the expressions $g_i(n)=T_1^{p_{i,1}(n)}\cdots T_d^{p_{i,d}(n)}$depends nontrivially on $n$ for $i=1,2,\cdots,k$, and for all $i\neq j\in\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ the expressions $g_i(n)g_j(n)^{-1}$ depend nontrivially on$n$, then there is a residual set $X_0$ of $X$ such that for all $x\in X_0$\begin{equation*} \{(g_1(n)x, g_2(n)x,\ldots, g_k(n)x)\in X^k:n\in \mathbb{Z}\}\end{equation*} is dense in $X^k$.

Solution of the anisotropic porous medium equation in $R^n$ under an  $L^1$-initial value

  Consider the anisotropic porous medium equation,$u_t=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(u^{m_i})_{x_ix_i},$ where $m_i>0, (i=1,2,...,n)$satisfying $\min\limits_{1\le i\le n}\{m_i\}\le 1,$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^nm_i>n-2,$ and $\max\limits_{1\le i\le n}\{m_i\}\le\frac{1}{n}(2+\sum\limits_{i=1}^nm_i).$ Assuming that the initial data belongonly to $L^1(\Re^n)$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solutionfor the Cauchy problem in the space, $C([0,\infty), L^1(\Re^n))\capC(\Re^n\times(0,\infty))\cap L^\infty(\Re^n\times[\epsilon,\infty)),$ where$\epsilon>0$ may be arbitrary. We also show a comparison principle for suchsolutions. Furthermore, we prove that the solution converges to zero in thespace $L^\infty(\Re^n)$ as the time goes to infinity.

On the universal family of Hilbert schemes of points on a surface

  For a smooth quasi-projective surface $X$ and an integer $n\ge 3$, we showthat the universal family $Z^n$ over the Hilbert scheme $\text{Hilb}^{n}(X)$ of$n$ points has non $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein, rational singularities, and thatthe Samuel multiplicity $\mu$ at a closed point on $Z^n$ can be computed interms of the dimension of the socle. We also show that $\mu\le n$.

Raman Scattering Study of the Lattice Dynamics of Superconducting LiFeAs

  We report an investigation of the lattice dynamical properties of LiFeAsusing inelastic light scattering. Five out of the six expected phonon modes areobserved. The temperature evolution of their frequencies and linewidths is ingood agreement with an anharmonic-decay model. We find no evidence forsubstantial electron-phonon coupling, and no superconductivity-induced phononanomalies.

Regionally proximal relation of order d is an equivalence one for  minimal systems and a combinatorial consequence

  By proving the minimality of face transformations acting on the diagonalpoints and searching the points allowed in the minimal sets, it is shown thatthe regionally proximal relation of order $d$, $\RP^{[d]}$, is an equivalencerelation for minimal systems. Moreover, the lifting of $\RP^{[d]}$ between twominimal systems is obtained, which implies that the factor induced by$\RP^{[d]}$ is the maximal $d$-step nilfactor. The above results extend thesame conclusions proved by Host, Kra and Maass for minimal distal systems.  A combinatorial consequence is that if $S$ is a dynamically syndetic subsetof $\Z$, then for each $d\ge 1$, $$\{(n_1,\...,n_d)\in \Z^d: n_1\ep_1+...+n_d\ep_d\in S, \ep_i\in \{0,1\}, 1\le i\le d\}$$ is syndetic. In some sensethis is the topological correspondence of the result obtained by Host and Krafor positive upper Banach density subsets using ergodic methods.

Nonparametric Estimation of Multi-View Latent Variable Models

  Spectral methods have greatly advanced the estimation of latent variablemodels, generating a sequence of novel and efficient algorithms with strongtheoretical guarantees. However, current spectral algorithms are largelyrestricted to mixtures of discrete or Gaussian distributions. In this paper, wepropose a kernel method for learning multi-view latent variable models,allowing each mixture component to be nonparametric. The key idea of the methodis to embed the joint distribution of a multi-view latent variable into areproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then the latent parameters are recoveredusing a robust tensor power method. We establish that the sample complexity forthe proposed method is quadratic in the number of latent components and is alow order polynomial in the other relevant parameters. Thus, our non-parametrictensor approach to learning latent variable models enjoys good sample andcomputational efficiencies. Moreover, the non-parametric tensor power methodcompares favorably to EM algorithm and other existing spectral algorithms inour experiments.

Double-critical graph conjecture for claw-free graphs

  A connected graph $G$ with chromatic number $t$ is double-critical if $G\backslash \{x, y\}$ is $(t - 2)$-colorable for each edge $xy \in E(G)$. Thecomplete graphs are the only known examples of double-critical graphs. Along-standing conjecture of Erd\H os and Lov\'asz from 1966, which is referredto as the Double-Critical Graph Conjecture, states that there are no otherdouble-critical graphs. That is, if a graph $G$ with chromatic number $t$ isdouble-critical, then $G$ is the complete graph on $t$ vertices. This has beenverified for $t \le 5$, but remains open for $t \ge 6$. In this paper, we firstprove that if $G$ is a non-complete, double-critical graph with chromaticnumber $t \ge 6$, then no vertex of degree $t + 1$ is adjacent to a vertex ofdegree $t+1$, $t + 2$, or $t + 3$ in $G$. We then use this result to show thatthe Double-Critical Graph Conjecture is true for double-critical graphs $G$with chromatic number $t \le 8$ if $G$ is claw-free.

Planar anti-Ramsey numbers of matchings

  Given a positive integer $n$ and a planar graph $H$, let $\mathcal{T}_n(H)$be the family of all plane triangulations $T$ on $n$ vertices such that $T$contains a subgraph isomorphic to $H$. The planar anti-Ramsey number of $H$,denoted $ar_{_\mathcal{P}}(n, H)$, is the maximum number of colors in anedge-coloring of a plane triangulation $T\in \mathcal{T}_n(H)$ such that $T$contains no rainbow copy of $H$. In this paper we study planar anti-Ramseynumbers of matchings. For all $t\ge1$, let $M_t$ denote a matching of size $t$.We prove that for all $t\ge6$ and $n\ge 3t-6$, $2n+3t-15\lear_{_{\mathcal{P}}}(n, {M}_t)\le 2n+4t-14$, which significantly improves theexisting lower and upper bounds for $ar_{_\mathcal{P}}(n, M_t)$. It seems thatfor each $t\ge6$, the lower bound we obtained is the exact value of$ar_{_{\mathcal{P}}}(n, {M}_t)$ for sufficiently large $n$. This is indeed thecase for $M_6$. We prove that $ar_{_\mathcal{P}}(n, M_6)=2n+3$ for all$n\ge30$.

Light charged Higgs boson with dominant decay to quarks and its search  at LHC and future colliders

  The possibility of a light charged Higgs boson $H^\pm$ that decayspredominantly to quarks ($cs$ and/or $cb$) and with a mass in the range 80 GeV$\le m_{H^\pm} \le 90$ GeV is studied in the context of Three-Higgs-DoubletModels (3HDMs). At present the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has littlesensitivity to this scenario, and currently the best constraints are from LEP2and Tevatron searches. The branching ratio of $H^\pm\to cb$ can be dominant intwo of the five types of 3HDM, and we determine the parameter space where thisoccurs. The decay $H^\pm\to cb$ has recently been searched for at the LHC forthe first time, and with increased integrated luminosity one would expectsensitivity to the region 80 GeV $\le m_{H^\pm} \le 90$ GeV due to the smallerbackgrounds with respect to $H^\pm\to cs$ decays.

Gallai-Ramsey numbers of cycles

  A Gallai coloring of a complete graph is an edge-coloring such that notriangle has all its edges colored differently. A Gallai $k$-coloring is aGallai coloring that uses $k$ colors. Given a graph $H$ and an integer $k\geq1$, the Gallai-Ramsey number $GR_k(H)$ of $H$ is the least positive integer $N$such that every Gallai $k$-coloring of the complete graph $K_N$ contains amonochromatic copy of $H$. Let $C_n$ denote a cycle on $n$ vertices. In thispaper, we first improve the known upper bound on the Gallai-Ramsey numbers ofeven cycles by showing that $GR_k( C_{2n})\le (n-1)k+2n+2$ for all $k\geq 1$and $n\geq 3$. We then use the new upper bound to completely determine theGallai-Ramsey numbers of all odd cycles. That is, we prove that$GR_k(C_{2n+1})=n\cdot 2^k+1$ for all $k\geq 1$ and $n\geq 3$.

Heat kernels of non-symmetric jump processes: beyond the stable case

  Let $J$ be the L\'evy density of a symmetric L\'evy process in $\mathbb{R}^d$with its L\'evy exponent satisfying a weak lower scaling condition at infinity.Consider the non-symmetric and non-local operator $$ {\mathcalL}^{\kappa}f(x):= \lim_{\epsilon \downarrow 0} \int_{\{z \in \mathbb{R}^d:|z|>\epsilon\}}(f(x+z)-f(x))\kappa(x,z)J(z)\, dz\, , $$ where $\kappa(x,z)$ isa Borel measurable function on $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying$0<\kappa_0\le \kappa(x,z)\le \kappa_1$, $\kappa(x,z)=\kappa(x,-z)$ and$|\kappa(x,z)-\kappa(y,z)|\le \kappa_2|x-y|^{\beta}$ for some $\beta\in (0,1)$. We construct the heat kernel $p^\kappa(t, x, y)$ of ${\mathcal L}^\kappa$,establish its upper bound as well as its fractional derivative and gradientestimates. Under an additional weak upper scaling condition at infinity, wealso establish a lower bound for the heat kernel $p^\kappa$.

Supervised Feature Selection via Dependence Estimation

  We introduce a framework for filtering features that employs theHilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a measure of dependencebetween the features and the labels. The key idea is that good features shouldmaximise such dependence. Feature selection for various supervised learningproblems (including classification and regression) is unified under thisframework, and the solutions can be approximated using a backward-eliminationalgorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on both artificial andreal world datasets.

Nonparametric Latent Tree Graphical Models: Inference, Estimation, and  Structure Learning

  Tree structured graphical models are powerful at expressing long range orhierarchical dependency among many variables, and have been widely applied indifferent areas of computer science and statistics. However, existing methodsfor parameter estimation, inference, and structure learning mainly rely on theGaussian or discrete assumptions, which are restrictive under manyapplications. In this paper, we propose new nonparametric methods based onreproducing kernel Hilbert space embeddings of distributions that can recoverthe latent tree structures, estimate the parameters, and perform inference forhigh dimensional continuous and non-Gaussian variables. The usefulness of theproposed methods are illustrated by thorough numerical results.

A la Carte - Learning Fast Kernels

  Kernel methods have great promise for learning rich statisticalrepresentations of large modern datasets. However, compared to neural networks,kernel methods have been perceived as lacking in scalability and flexibility.We introduce a family of fast, flexible, lightly parametrized and generalpurpose kernel learning methods, derived from Fastfood basis functionexpansions. We provide mechanisms to learn the properties of groups of spectralfrequencies in these expansions, which require only O(mlogd) time and O(m)memory, for m basis functions and d input dimensions. We show that the proposedmethods can learn a wide class of kernels, outperforming the alternatives inaccuracy, speed, and memory consumption.

Uniform Hausdorff dimension result for the inverse images of stable  Lévy processes

  We establish a uniform Hausdorff dimension result for the inverse image setsof real-valued strictly $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes with $1< \alpha\le 2$.This extends a theorem of Kaufman for Brownian motion. Our method is differentfrom that of Kaufman and depends on covering principles for Markov processes.

Reinforcement Learning for Uplift Modeling

  Uplift modeling aims to directly model the incremental impact of a treatmenton an individual response. In this work, we address the problem from a newangle and reformulate it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We conductedextensive experiments on both a synthetic dataset and real-world scenarios, andshowed that our method can achieve significant improvement over previousmethods.

Meta Particle Flow for Sequential Bayesian Inference

  We present a particle flow realization of Bayes' rule, where an ODE-basedneural operator is used to transport particles from a prior to its posteriorafter a new observation. We prove that such an ODE operator exists and itsneural parameterization can be trained in a meta-learning framework, allowingthis operator to reason about the effect of an individual observation on theposterior, and thus generalize across different priors, observations and toonline Bayesian inference. We demonstrated the generalization ability of ourparticle flow Bayes operator in several canonical and high dimensionalexamples.

General Relation between Entanglement and Fluctuations in One Dimension

  In one dimension very general results from conformal field theory and exactcalculations for certain quantum spin systems have established universalscaling properties of the entanglement entropy between two parts of a criticalsystem. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show that if particlenumber or spin is conserved, fluctuations in a subsystem obey identical scalingas a function of subsystem size, suggesting that fluctuations are a usefulquantity for determining the scaling of entanglement, especially in higherdimensions. We investigate the effects of boundaries and subleading correctionsfor critical spin and bosonic chains.

Entanglement from Charge Statistics: Exact Relations for Many-Body  Systems

  We present exact formulas for the entanglement and R\'{e}nyi entropiesgenerated at a quantum point contact (QPC) in terms of the statistics of chargefluctuations, which we illustrate with examples from both equilibrium andnon-equilibrium transport. The formulas are also applicable to groundstateentanglement in systems described by non-interacting fermions in any dimension,which in one dimension includes the critical spin-1/2 XX and Ising models whereconformal field theory predictions for the entanglement and R\'{e}nyi entropiesare reproduced from the full counting statistics. These results may play acrucial role in the experimental detection of many-body entanglement inmesoscopic structures and cold atoms in optical lattices.

Entanglement Entropy of the Two-Dimensional Heisenberg Antiferromagnet

  We compute the von Neumann and generalized R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropiesin the ground-state of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on thesquare lattice using the modified spin-wave theory for finite lattices. Theaddition of a staggered magnetic field to regularize the Goldstone modesassociated with symmetry-breaking is shown to be essential for obtainingwell-behaved values for the entanglement entropy. The von Neumann and R\'{e}nyientropies obey an area law with additive logarithmic corrections, and are ingood quantitative agreement with numerical results from valence bond quantumMonte Carlo and density matrix renormalization group calculations. We alsocompute the spin fluctuations and observe a multiplicative logarithmiccorrection to the area law in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlocalculations.

On motivic Joyce-Song formula for the Behrend function identities

  We prove the version of Joyce-Song formula for the Behrend functionidentities in the motivic setting. The main method we use is the proof ofKontsevich-Soibelman conjecture about the motivic Milnor fibers by Q. T. Le,who uses the method of motivic integration for formal schemes andCluckers-Loeser's motivic constructible functions. In the Appendix the motivicformula can be used to provide a different proof that there is an algebrahomomorphism of Kontsevich-Soibelman from the motivic Hall algebra of theabelian category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau threefold $Y$ to themotivic quantum torus of $Y$.

The number of rational points on a family of varieties over finite  fields

  Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ stand for the finite field of odd characteristic $p$ with$q$ elements ($q=p^{n},n\in \mathbb{N} $) and $\mathbb{F}_q^*$ denote the setof all the nonzero elements of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Let $m$ and $t$ be positiveintegers. In this paper, by using the Smith normal form of the exponent matrix,we obtain a formula for the number of rational points on the variety defined bythe following system of equations over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$: $$\sum\limits_{j=0}^{t-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{r_{j+1}-r_j}a_{k,r_j+i}x_1^{e^{(k)}_{r_j+i,1}}...x_{n_{j+1}}^{e^{(k)}_{r_j+i,n_{j+1}}}=b_k,\ k=1,...,m. $$ where the integers $t>0$, $r_0=0<r_1<r_2<...<r_t$, $1\len_1<n_2<...<n_t$, $0\leq j\leq t-1$, $b_k\in \mathbb{F}_{q}$, $a_{k,i}\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*}$, $(k=1,...,m, i=1,...,r_t)$, and the exponent of eachvariable is a positive integer. Furthermore, under some natural conditions, wearrive at an explicit formula for the number of the above variety. It extendsthe results obtained previously by Wolfmann, Sun, Wang, Song, Chen, Hong, Huand Zhao et al. Our result also answers completely an open problem raised bySong and Chen.

Star 5-edge-colorings of subcubic multigraphs

  The star chromatic index of a multigraph $G$, denoted $\chi'_{s}(G)$, is theminimum number of colors needed to properly color the edges of $G$ such that nopath or cycle of length four is bi-colored. A multigraph $G$ is star$k$-edge-colorable if $\chi'_{s}(G)\le k$. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Mohar and \v{S}\'amal[Star chromatic index, J Graph Theory 72 (2013), 313--326] proved that everysubcubic multigraph is star $7$-edge-colorable, and conjectured that everysubcubic multigraph should be star $6$-edge-colorable. Kerdjoudj, Kostochka andRaspaud considered the list version of this problem for simple graphs andproved that every subcubic graph with maximum average degree less than $7/3$ isstar list-$5$-edge-colorable. It is known that a graph with maximum averagedegree $14/5$ is not necessarily star $5$-edge-colorable. In this paper, weprove that every subcubic multigraph with maximum average degree less than$12/5$ is star $5$-edge-colorable.

Time-Varying Networks: Recovering Temporally Rewiring Genetic Networks  During the Life Cycle of Drosophila melanogaster

  Due to the dynamic nature of biological systems, biological networksunderlying temporal process such as the development of {\it Drosophilamelanogaster} can exhibit significant topological changes to facilitate dynamicregulatory functions. Thus it is essential to develop methodologies thatcapture the temporal evolution of networks, which make it possible to study thedriving forces underlying dynamic rewiring of gene regulation circuity, and topredict future network structures. Using a new machine learning method calledTesla, which builds on a novel temporal logistic regression technique, wereport the first successful genome-wide reverse-engineering of the latentsequence of temporally rewiring gene networks over more than 4000 genes duringthe life cycle of \textit{Drosophila melanogaster}, given longitudinal geneexpression measurements and even when a single snapshot of such measurementresulted from each (time-specific) network is available. Our methods offer thefirst glimpse of time-specific snapshots and temporal evolution patterns ofgene networks in a living organism during its full developmental course. Therecovered networks with this unprecedented resolution chart the onset andduration of many gene interactions which are missed by typical static networkanalysis, and are suggestive of a wide array of other temporal behaviors of thegene network over time not noticed before.

Star chromatic index of subcubic multigraphs

  The star chromatic index of a multigraph $G$, denoted $\chi'_{s}(G)$, is theminimum number of colors needed to properly color the edges of $G$ such that nopath or cycle of length four is bi-colored. A multigraph $G$ is star$k$-edge-colorable if $\chi'_{s}(G)\le k$. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Mohar and \v{S}\'amal[Star chromatic index, J. Graph Theory 72 (2013), 313--326] proved that everysubcubic multigraph is star $7$-edge-colorable. They conjectured in the samepaper that every subcubic multigraph should be star $6$-edge-colorable. In thispaper, we first prove that it is NP-complete to determine whether$\chi'_s(G)\le3$ for an arbitrary graph $G$. This answers a question of Mohar.We then establish some structure results on subcubic multigraphs $G$ with$\delta(G)\le2$ such that $\chi'_s(G)>k$ but $\chi'_s(G-v)\le k$ for any $v\inV(G)$, where $k\in\{5,6\}$. We finally apply the structure results, along witha simple discharging method, to prove that every subcubic multigraph $G$ isstar $6$-edge-colorable if $mad(G)<5/2$, and star $5$-edge-colorable if$mad(G)<24/11$, respectively, where $mad(G)$ is the maximum average degree of amultigraph $G$. This partially confirms the conjecture of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Moharand \v{S}\'amal.

Extremal Theta-free planar graphs

  Given a family $\mathcal{F}$, a graph is $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does notcontain any graph in $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. We study the topic of"extremal" planar graphs initiated by Dowden [J. Graph Theory 83 (2016)213--230], that is, how many edges can an $\mathcal{F}$-free planar graph on$n$ vertices have? We define $ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,\mathcal{F})$ to be themaximum number of edges in an $\mathcal{F}$-free planar graph on $n $ vertices.Dowden obtained the tight bounds $ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,C_4)\leq15(n-2)/7$ forall $n\geq4$ and $ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,C_5)\leq(12n-33)/5$ for all $n\geq11$. Inthis paper, we continue to promote the idea of determining$ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,\mathcal{F})$ for certain classes $\mathcal{F}$. Let$\Theta_k$ denote the family of Theta graphs on $k\ge4$ vertices, that is,graphs obtained from a cycle $C_k$ by adding an additional edge joining twonon-consecutive vertices. The study of $ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,\Theta_4)$ wassuggested by Dowden. We show that $ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,\Theta_4)\leq12(n-2)/5$for all $n\geq 4$, $ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,\Theta_5)\leq5(n-2)/2$ for all $n\ge5$,and then demonstrate that these bounds are tight, in the sense that there areinfinitely many values of $n$ for which they are attained exactly. We alsoprove that $ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,C_6)\le ex_{_\mathcal{P}}(n,\Theta_6)\le18(n-2)/7$ for all $n\ge6$.

Decay of Loschmidt Echo Enhanced by Quantum Criticality

  We study the transition of a quantum system $S $ from a pure state to a mixedone, which is induced by the quantum criticality of the surrounding system $E$coupled to it. To characterize this transition quantitatively, we carefullyexamine the behavior of the Loschmidt echo (LE) of $E$ modelled as an Isingmodel in a transverse field, which behaves as a measuring apparatus in quantummeasurement. It is found that the quantum critical behavior of $E$ stronglyaffects its capability of enhancing the decay of LE: near the critical value ofthe transverse field entailing the happening of quantum phase transition, theoff-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix describing $S$ vanishsharply.

Pressure-induced phase transition and superconductivity in YBa2Cu4O8

  We investigate the pressure and temperature dependence of the latticedynamics of the underdoped, stoichiometric, high temperature superconductorYBa2Cu4O8 by means of Raman spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. Thissystem undergoes a reversible pressure-induced structural phase transitionaround 10 GPa to a collapsed orthorhombic structure, that is well reproduced bythe calculation. The coupling of the B1g-like buckling phonon mode to theelectronic continuum is used to probe superconductivity. In the low pressurephase, self-energy effects through the superconducting transition renormalizethis phonon, and the amplitude of this renormalization strongly increases withpressure. Whereas our calculation indicates that this mode's coupling to theelectronic system is only marginally affected by the structural phasetransition, the aforementioned renormalization is completely suppressed in thehigh pressure phase, demonstrating that under hydrostatic pressures higher than10 GPa, superconductivity in YBa2Cu4O8 is greatly weakened or obliterated.

Anisotropic hybridization in a new Kondo lattice compound CeCoInGa$_3$

  We report a detailed and comparative study of the single crystal CeCoInGa$_3$in both experiment and theory. Resistivity measurements reveal the typicalbehavior of Kondo lattice with the onset temperature of coherence, $T^*\approx50\,$K. The magnetic specific heat can be well fitted using a spin-fluctuationmodel at low temperatures, yielding a large Sommerfeld coefficient,$\gamma\approx172\,$mJ/mol K$^2$ at 6 K, suggesting that this is aheavy-fermion compound with a pronounced coherence effect. The magneticsusceptibility exhibits a broad field-independent peak at $T_{\chi}$ and showsan obvious anisotropy within the $bc$ plane, reflecting the anisotropy of thecoherence effect at high temperatures. These are compared with stronglycorrelated calculations combining first-principles band structure calculationsand dynamical mean-field theory. Our results confirm the onset of coherence atabout 50 K and reveal a similar anisotropy in the hybridization gap, pointingto a close connection between the hybridization strength of the low-temperatureFermi-liquid state and the high-temperature coherence effect.

Sharp Space-Time Regularity of the Solution to Stochastic Heat Equation  Driven by Fractional-Colored Noise

  In this paper, we study the following stochastic heat equation \[  \partial_tu=\mathcal{L} u(t,x)+\dot{B},\quad  u(0,x)=0,\quad 0\le t\le T,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}d, \] where $\mathcal{L}$ isthe generator of a L\'evy process $X$ taking value in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $B$ is afractional-colored Gaussian noise with Hurst index$H\in\left(\frac12,\,1\right)$ for the time variable and spatial covariancefunction $f$ which is the Fourier transform of a tempered measure $\mu.$  After establishing the existence of solution for the stochastic heatequation, we study the regularity of the solution $\{u(t,x),\, t\ge 0,\,x\in\mathbb{R}^d\}$ in both time and space variables. Under mild conditions, wegive the exact uniform modulus of continuity and a Chung-type law of iteratedlogarithm for the sample function $(t,x)\mapsto u(t,x)$. Our results generalizeand strengthen the corresponding results of Balan and Tudor (2008) and Tudorand Xiao (2017).

Exact rainbow numbers for matchings in plane triangulations

  Given two graphs $G$ and $H$, the {\it rainbow number} $rb(G,H)$ for $H$ withrespect to $G$ is defined as the minimum number $k$ such that any$k$-edge-coloring of $G$ contains a rainbow $H$, i.e., a copy of $H$, all ofits edges have different colors. Denote by $M_t$ a matching of size $t$ and$\mathcal {T}_n$ the class of all plane triangulations of order $n$,respectively. Jendrol', Schiermeyer and Tu initiated to investigate the rainbownumbers for matchings in plane triangulations, and proved some bounds for thevalue of $rb({\mathcal {T}_n},M_t)$. Chen, Lan and Song proved that $2n+3t-14\le rb(\mathcal {T}_n, M_t)\le 2n+4t-13$ for all $n\ge 3t-6$ and $t \ge 6$. Inthis paper, we determine the exact values of $rb({\mathcal {T}_n},M_t)$ forlarge $n$, namely, $rb({\mathcal {T}_n},M_t)=2n+3t-14$ for all $n \ge 9t+3$ and$t\ge 7$.

Bipartite Fluctuations as a Probe of Many-Body Entanglement

  We investigate in detail the behavior of the bipartite fluctuations ofparticle number $\hat{N}$ and spin $\hat{S}^z$ in many-body quantum systems,focusing on systems where such U(1) charges are both conserved and fluctuatewithin subsystems due to exchange of charges between subsystems. We proposethat the bipartite fluctuations are an effective tool for studying many-bodyphysics, particularly its entanglement properties, in the same way that noiseand Full Counting Statistics have been used in mesoscopic transport and coldatomic gases. For systems that can be mapped to a problem of non-interactingfermions we show that the fluctuations and higher-order cumulants fully encodethe information needed to determine the entanglement entropy as well as thefull entanglement spectrum through the R\'{e}nyi entropies. In this connectionwe derive a simple formula that explicitly relates the eigenvalues of thereduced density matrix to the R\'{e}nyi entropies of integer order for anyfinite density matrix. In other systems, particularly in one dimension, thefluctuations are in many ways similar but not equivalent to the entanglemententropy. Fluctuations are tractable analytically, computable numerically inboth density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo calculations,and in principle accessible in condensed matter and cold atom experiments. Inthe context of quantum point contacts, measurement of the second chargecumulant showing a logarithmic dependence on time would constitute a strongindication of many-body entanglement.

Online Supervised Subspace Tracking

  We present a framework for supervised subspace tracking, when there are twotime series $x_t$ and $y_t$, one being the high-dimensional predictors and theother being the response variables and the subspace tracking needs to take intoconsideration of both sequences. It extends the classic online subspacetracking work which can be viewed as tracking of $x_t$ only. Our onlinesufficient dimensionality reduction (OSDR) is a meta-algorithm that can beapplied to various cases including linear regression, logistic regression,multiple linear regression, multinomial logistic regression, support vectormachine, the random dot product model and the multi-scale union-of-subspacemodel. OSDR reduces data-dimensionality on-the-fly with low-computationalcomplexity and it can also handle missing data and dynamic data. OSDR uses analternating minimization scheme and updates the subspace via gradient descenton the Grassmannian manifold. The subspace update can be performed efficientlyutilizing the fact that the Grassmannian gradient with respect to the subspacein many settings is rank-one (or low-rank in certain cases). The optimizationproblem for OSDR is non-convex and hard to analyze in general; we provideconvergence analysis of OSDR in a simple linear regression setting. The goodperformance of OSDR compared with the conventional unsupervised subspacetracking are demonstrated via numerical examples on simulated and real data.

Neural Network-based Graph Embedding for Cross-Platform Binary Code  Similarity Detection

  The problem of cross-platform binary code similarity detection aims atdetecting whether two binary functions coming from different platforms aresimilar or not. It has many security applications, including plagiarismdetection, malware detection, vulnerability search, etc. Existing approachesrely on approximate graph matching algorithms, which are inevitably slow andsometimes inaccurate, and hard to adapt to a new task. To address these issues,in this work, we propose a novel neural network-based approach to compute theembedding, i.e., a numeric vector, based on the control flow graph of eachbinary function, then the similarity detection can be done efficiently bymeasuring the distance between the embeddings for two functions. We implement aprototype called Gemini. Our extensive evaluation shows that Gemini outperformsthe state-of-the-art approaches by large margins with respect to similaritydetection accuracy. Further, Gemini can speed up prior art's embeddinggeneration time by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude and reduce the required trainingtime from more than 1 week down to 30 minutes to 10 hours. Our real world casestudies demonstrate that Gemini can identify significantly more vulnerablefirmware images than the state-of-the-art, i.e., Genius. Our research showcasesa successful application of deep learning on computer security problems.

Improved Upper Bounds for Gallai-Ramsey Numbers of Odd Cycles

  A Gallai coloring of a complete graph is an edge-coloring such that notriangle has all its edges colored differently. A Gallai $k$-coloring is aGallai coloring that uses $k$ colors. Given an integer $k\ge1$ and a graph $H$,the Gallai-Ramsey number $GR_k(H)$ is the least positive integer $n$ such thatevery Gallai $k$-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ contains a monochromaticcopy of $H$. Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, Seb\H{o} and Selkow proved in2010 that $GR_k (H) $ is exponential in $k$ if $H$ is not bipartite, linear in$k$ if $H$ is bipartite but not a star, and constant (does not depend on $k$)when $H$ is a star. Hence, $GR_k(H)$ is more well-behaved than the classicalRamsey number $R_k(H)$. However, finding exact values of $GR_k (H)$ is far fromtrivial, even when $|V(H)|$ is small. In this paper, we first improve theexisting upper bounds for Gallai-Ramsey numbers of odd cycles by showing that$GR_k(C_{2n+1}) \le (n\ln n) \cdot 2^k -(k+1)n+1$ for all $k \ge 3$ and $n \ge8$. We then prove that $GR_k( C_{13})= 6\cdot 2^k+1$ and $GR_k( C_{15})= 7\cdot2^k+1$ for all $k\ge1$.

Gallai-Ramsey numbers of $C_{10}$ and $C_{12}$

  A Gallai coloring is a coloring of the edges of a complete graph withoutrainbow triangles, and a Gallai $k$-coloring is a Gallai coloring that uses $k$colors. Given an integer $k\ge1$ and graphs $H_1, \ldots, H_k$, theGallai-Ramsey number $GR(H_1, \ldots, H_k)$ is the least integer $n$ such thatevery Gallai $k$-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ contains a monochromaticcopy of $H_i$ in color $i$ for some $i \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$. When $H = H_1 =\cdots = H_k$, we simply write $GR_k(H)$. We continue to study Gallai-Ramseynumbers of even cycles and paths. For all $n\ge3$ and $k\ge1$, let$G_i=P_{2i+3}$ be a path on $2i+3$ vertices for all $i\in\{0,1, \ldots, n-2\}$and $G_{n-1}\in\{C_{2n}, P_{2n+1}\}$. Let $ i_j\in\{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}$ for all$j\in\{1, \ldots, k\}$ with $ i_1\ge i_2\ge\cdots\ge i_k $. Song recentlyconjectured that $GR(G_{i_1}, \ldots, G_{i_k}) = 3+\min\{i_1,n^*-2\}+\sum_{j=1}^k i_j$, where $n^* =n$ when $G_{i_1}\ne P_{2n+1}$ and $n^*=n+1$ when $G_{i_1}= P_{2n+1}$. This conjecture has been verified to be truefor $n\in\{3,4\}$ and all $k\ge1$. In this paper, we prove that theaforementioned conjecture holds for $n \in\{5, 6\}$ and all $k \ge1$. Ourresult implies that for all $k \ge 1$, $GR_k(C_{2n}) = GR_k(P_{2n}) =(n-1)k+n+1$ for $n\in\{5,6\}$ and $GR_k(P_{2n+1})= (n-1)k+n+2$ for $1\le n \le6$.

Budgeted Influence Maximization for Multiple Products

  The typical algorithmic problem in viral marketing aims to identify a set ofinfluential users in a social network, who, when convinced to adopt a product,shall influence other users in the network and trigger a large cascade ofadoptions. However, the host (the owner of an online social platform) oftenfaces more constraints than a single product, endless user attentions,unlimited budget and unbounded time; in reality, multiple products need to beadvertised, each user can tolerate only a small number of recommendations,influencing user has a cost and advertisers have only limited budgets, and theadoptions need to be maximized within a short time window.  Given theses myriads of user, monetary, and timing constraints, it isextremely challenging for the host to design principled and efficient viralmarket algorithms with provable guarantees. In this paper, we provide a novelsolution by formulating the problem as a submodular maximization in acontinuous-time diffusion model under an intersection of a matroid and multipleknapsack constraints. We also propose an adaptive threshold greedy algorithmwhich can be faster than the traditional greedy algorithm with lazy evaluation,and scalable to networks with million of nodes. Furthermore, our mathematicalformulation allows us to prove that the algorithm can achieve an approximationfactor of $k_a/(2+2 k)$ when $k_a$ out of the $k$ knapsack constraints areactive, which also improves over previous guarantees from combinatorialoptimization literature. In the case when influencing each user has uniformcost, the approximation becomes even better to a factor of $1/3$. Extensivesynthetic and real world experiments demonstrate that our budgeted influencemaximization algorithm achieves the-state-of-the-art in terms of botheffectiveness and scalability, often beating the next best by significantmargins.

Fluctuations and Entanglement spectrum in quantum Hall states

  The measurement of quantum entanglement in many-body systems remainschallenging. One experimentally relevant fact about quantum entanglement isthat in systems whose degrees of freedom map to free fermions with conservedtotal particle number, exact relations hold relating the Full CountingStatistics associated with the bipartite charge fluctuations and the sequenceof R\' enyi entropies. We draw a correspondence between the bipartite chargefluctuations and the entanglement spectrum, mediated by the R\' enyi entropies.In the case of the integer quantum Hall effect, we show that it is possible toreproduce the generic features of the entanglement spectrum from a measurementof the second charge cumulant only. Additionally, asking whether it is possibleto extend the free fermion result to the $\nu=1/3$ fractional quantum Hallcase, we provide numerical evidence that the answer is negative in general. Wefurther address the problem of quantum Hall edge states described by aLuttinger liquid, and derive expressions for the spectral functions of the realspace entanglement spectrum at a quantum point contact realized in a quantumHall sample.

A comment on Ryser's conjecture for intersecting hypergraphs

  Let $\tau(\mathcal{H})$ be the cover number and $\nu(\mathcal{H})$ be thematching number of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. Ryser conjectured that every$r$-partite hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ satisfies the inequality$\tau(\mathcal{H}) \leq (r-1) \nu (\mathcal{H})$. This conjecture is open forall $r \ge 4$. For intersecting hypergraphs, namely those with$\nu(\mathcal{H})=1$, Ryser's conjecture reduces to $\tau(\mathcal{H}) \leqr-1$. Even this conjecture is extremely difficult and is open for all $ r \ge6$. For infinitely many $r$ there are examples of intersecting $r$-partitehypergraphs with $\tau(\mathcal{H})=r-1$, demonstrating the tightness of theconjecture for such $r$. However, all previously known constructions are notoptimal as they use far too many edges. How sparse can an intersecting$r$-partite hypergraph be, given that its cover number is as large as possible,namely $\tau(\mathcal{H}) \ge r-1$? In this paper we solve this question for $r\le 5$, give an almost optimal construction for $r=6$, prove that any$r$-partite intersecting hypergraph with $\tau(H) \ge r-1$ must have at least$(3-\frac{1}{\sqrt{18}})r(1-o(1)) \approx 2.764r(1-o(1))$ edges, and conjecturethat there exist constructions with $\Theta(r)$ edges.

Estimating time-varying networks

  Stochastic networks are a plausible representation of the relationalinformation among entities in dynamic systems such as living cells or socialcommunities. While there is a rich literature in estimating a static ortemporally invariant network from observation data, little has been done towardestimating time-varying networks from time series of entity attributes. In thispaper we present two new machine learning methods for estimating time-varyingnetworks, which both build on a temporally smoothed $l_1$-regularized logisticregression formalism that can be cast as a standard convex-optimization problemand solved efficiently using generic solvers scalable to large networks. Wereport promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks. Forreal data sets, we reverse engineer the latent sequence of temporally rewiringpolitical networks between Senators from the US Senate voting records and thelatent evolving regulatory networks underlying 588 genes across the life cycleof Drosophila melanogaster from the microarray time course.

Kernel Bayes' rule

  A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed,based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map tothe RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms ofRKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is neededfor these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weightedsample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior isderived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applicationsof the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Baysian computation withoutlikelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model.

Infinite Hierarchical MMSB Model for Nested Communities/Groups in Social  Networks

  Actors in realistic social networks play not one but a number of diverseroles depending on whom they interact with, and a large number of suchrole-specific interactions collectively determine social communities and theirorganizations. Methods for analyzing social networks should capture thesemulti-faceted role-specific interactions, and, more interestingly, discover thelatent organization or hierarchy of social communities. We propose ahierarchical Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel to model the generation ofhierarchies in social communities, selective membership of actors to subsets ofthese communities, and the resultant networks due to within- andcross-community interactions. Furthermore, to automatically discover theselatent structures from social networks, we develop a Gibbs sampling algorithmfor our model. We conduct extensive validation of our model using syntheticnetworks, and demonstrate the utility of our model in real-world datasets suchas predator-prey networks and citation networks.

Detecting Quantum Critical Points using Bipartite Fluctuations

  We show that the concept of bipartite fluctuations F provides a veryefficient tool to detect quantum phase transitions in strongly correlatedsystems. Using state of the art numerical techniques complemented withanalytical arguments, we investigate paradigmatic examples for both quantumspins and bosons. As compared to the von Neumann entanglement entropy, weobserve that F allows to find quantum critical points with a much betteraccuracy in one dimension. We further demonstrate that F can be successfullyapplied to the detection of quantum criticality in higher dimensions with noprior knowledge of the universality class of the transition. Promisingapproaches to experimentally access fluctuations are discussed for quantumantiferromagnets and cold gases.

d-wave Superfluid with Gapless Edges in a Cold Atom Trap

  We consider a strongly repulsive fermionic gas in a two-dimensional opticallattice confined by a harmonic trapping potential. To address the stronglyrepulsive regime, we consider the $t-J$ Hamiltonian. The presence of theharmonic trapping potential enables the stabilization of coexisting andcompeting phases. In particular, at low temperatures, this allows therealization of a d-wave superfluid region surrounded by purely (gapless) normaledges. Solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and comparing with the localdensity approximation, we show that the proximity to the Mott insulator isrevealed by a downturn of the Fermi liquid order parameter at the center of thetrap where the d-wave gap has a maximum. The density profile evolves linearlywith distance.

Structured Estimation in Nonparameteric Cox Model

  To better understand the interplay of censoring and sparsity we developfinite sample properties of nonparametric Cox proportional hazard's model. Dueto high impact of sequencing data, carrying genetic information of eachindividual, we work with over-parametrized problem and propose general class ofgroup penalties suitable for sparse structured variable selection andestimation. Novel non-asymptotic sandwich bounds for the partial likelihood aredeveloped. We establish how they extend notion of local asymptotic normality(LAN) of Le Cam's. Such non-asymptotic LAN principles are further extended tohigh dimensional spaces where $p \gg n$. Finite sample prediction properties ofpenalized estimator in non-parametric Cox proportional hazards model, undersuitable censoring conditions, agree with those of penalized estimator inlinear models.

Unfolding Latent Tree Structures using 4th Order Tensors

  Discovering the latent structure from many observed variables is an importantyet challenging learning task. Existing approaches for discovering latentstructures often require the unknown number of hidden states as an input. Inthis paper, we propose a quartet based approach which is \emph{agnostic} tothis number. The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of thetensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. Thischaracterization allows us to design a \emph{nuclear norm} based test forresolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in adivide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Undermild conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decaysexponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposedapproach compares favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, italso discovers meaningful groupings of variables, and produces a model thatfits the data better.

A Spectral Algorithm for Latent Junction Trees

  Latent variable models are an elegant framework for capturing richprobabilistic dependencies in many applications. However, current approachestypically parametrize these models using conditional probability tables, andlearning relies predominantly on local search heuristics such as ExpectationMaximization. Using tensor algebra, we propose an alternative parameterizationof latent variable models (where the model structures are junction trees) thatstill allows for computation of marginals among observed variables. While thisnovel representation leads to a moderate increase in the number of parametersfor junction trees of low treewidth, it lets us design a local-minimum-freealgorithm for learning this parameterization. The main computation of thealgorithm involves only tensor operations and SVDs which can be orders ofmagnitude faster than EM algorithms for large datasets. To our knowledge, thisis the first provably consistent parameter learning technique for a large classof low-treewidth latent graphical models beyond trees. We demonstrate theadvantages of our method on synthetic and real datasets.

Scaling of entanglement entropy across Lifshitz transitions

  We investigate the scaling of the bipartite entanglement entropy acrossLifshitz quantum phase transitions, where the topology of the Fermi surfacechanges without any changes in symmetry. We present both numerical andanalytical results which show that Lifshitz transitions are characterized by awell-defined set of critical exponents for the entanglement entropy near thephase transition. In one dimension, we show that the entanglement entropyexhibits a length scale that diverges as the system approaches a Lifshitzcritical point. In two dimensions, the leading and sub-leading coefficients ofthe scaling of entanglement entropy show distinct power-law singularities atcritical points. The effect of weak interactions is investigated using thedensity matrix renormalization group algorithm.
