A Low-Mass Black Hole in the Nearby Seyfert Galaxy UGC 06728

  We present the results of a recent reverberation mapping campaign for UGC
06728, a nearby low-luminosity Seyfert 1 in a late-type galaxy. Nightly
monitoring in the spring of 2015 allowed us to determine an H$\beta$ time delay
of $\tau = 1.4 \pm 0.8$ days. Combined with the width of the variable H$\beta$
line profile, we determine a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (7.1 \pm 4.0)
\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$. We also constrain the bulge stellar velocity
dispersion from higher-resolution long slit spectroscopy along the galaxy minor
axis and find $\sigma_{\star} = 51.6 \pm 4.9$ km s$^{-1}$. The measurements
presented here are in good agreement with both the $R_{\rm BLR} - L$
relationship and the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relationship for AGNs.
Combined with a previously published spin measurement, our mass determination
for UGC 06728 makes it the lowest-mass black hole that has been fully
characterized, and thus an important object to help anchor the low-mass end of
black hole evolutionary models.


A proposal for a coordinated effort for the determination of brainwide
  neuroanatomical connectivity in model organisms at a mesoscopic scale

  In this era of complete genomes, our knowledge of neuroanatomical circuitry
remains surprisingly sparse. Such knowledge is however critical both for basic
and clinical research into brain function. Here we advocate for a concerted
effort to fill this gap, through systematic, experimental mapping of neural
circuits at a mesoscopic scale of resolution suitable for comprehensive,
brain-wide coverage, using injections of tracers or viral vectors. We detail
the scientific and medical rationale and briefly review existing knowledge and
experimental techniques. We define a set of desiderata, including brain-wide
coverage; validated and extensible experimental techniques suitable for
standardization and automation; centralized, open access data repository;
compatibility with existing resources, and tractability with current
informatics technology. We discuss a hypothetical but tractable plan for mouse,
additional efforts for the macaque, and technique development for human. We
estimate that the mouse connectivity project could be completed within five
years with a comparatively modest budget.


Toward Complete Statistics of Massive Binary Stars: Penultimate Results
  from the Cygnus OB2 Radial Velocity Survey

  We analyze orbital solutions for 48 massive multiple-star systems in the
Cygnus OB2 Association, 23 of which are newly presented here, to find that the
observed distribution of orbital periods is approximately uniform in log P for
P<45 d, but it is not scale-free. Inflections in the cumulative distribution
near 6 d, 14, d, and 45 d, suggest key physical scales of ~0.2, ~0.4, and ~1
A.U. where yet-to-be-identified phenomena create distinct features. No single
power law provides a statistically compelling prescription, but if features are
ignored, a power law with exponent beta = -0.22 provides a crude approximation
over P=1.4 -- 2000 d, as does a piece-wise linear function with a break near 45
d. The cumulative period distribution flattens at P > 45 d, even after
correction for completeness, indicating either a lower binary fraction or a
shift toward low-mass companions. A high degree of similarity (91% likelihood)
between the Cyg OB2 period distribution and that of other surveys suggests that
the binary properties at P<25 d are determined by local physics of disk/clump
fragmentation and are relatively insensitive to environmental and evolutionary
factors. Fully 30% of the unbiased parent sample is a binary with period P < 45
d. Completeness corrections imply a binary fraction near 55% for P < 5000 d.
The observed distribution of mass ratios 0.2<q<1 is consistent with uniform,
while the observed distribution of eccentricities 0.1<e<0.6 is consistent with
uniform plus an excess of e ~ 0 systems. We identify six stars, all
supergiants, that exhibit aperiodic velocity variations of ~30 km/s attributed
to atmospheric fluctuations.
