A Low-Mass Black Hole in the Nearby Seyfert Galaxy UGC 06728

  We present the results of a recent reverberation mapping campaign for UGC06728, a nearby low-luminosity Seyfert 1 in a late-type galaxy. Nightlymonitoring in the spring of 2015 allowed us to determine an H$\beta$ time delayof $\tau = 1.4 \pm 0.8$ days. Combined with the width of the variable H$\beta$line profile, we determine a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (7.1 \pm 4.0)\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$. We also constrain the bulge stellar velocitydispersion from higher-resolution long slit spectroscopy along the galaxy minoraxis and find $\sigma_{\star} = 51.6 \pm 4.9$ km s$^{-1}$. The measurementspresented here are in good agreement with both the $R_{\rm BLR} - L$relationship and the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relationship for AGNs.Combined with a previously published spin measurement, our mass determinationfor UGC 06728 makes it the lowest-mass black hole that has been fullycharacterized, and thus an important object to help anchor the low-mass end ofblack hole evolutionary models.

A proposal for a coordinated effort for the determination of brainwide  neuroanatomical connectivity in model organisms at a mesoscopic scale

  In this era of complete genomes, our knowledge of neuroanatomical circuitryremains surprisingly sparse. Such knowledge is however critical both for basicand clinical research into brain function. Here we advocate for a concertedeffort to fill this gap, through systematic, experimental mapping of neuralcircuits at a mesoscopic scale of resolution suitable for comprehensive,brain-wide coverage, using injections of tracers or viral vectors. We detailthe scientific and medical rationale and briefly review existing knowledge andexperimental techniques. We define a set of desiderata, including brain-widecoverage; validated and extensible experimental techniques suitable forstandardization and automation; centralized, open access data repository;compatibility with existing resources, and tractability with currentinformatics technology. We discuss a hypothetical but tractable plan for mouse,additional efforts for the macaque, and technique development for human. Weestimate that the mouse connectivity project could be completed within fiveyears with a comparatively modest budget.

Toward Complete Statistics of Massive Binary Stars: Penultimate Results  from the Cygnus OB2 Radial Velocity Survey

  We analyze orbital solutions for 48 massive multiple-star systems in theCygnus OB2 Association, 23 of which are newly presented here, to find that theobserved distribution of orbital periods is approximately uniform in log P forP<45 d, but it is not scale-free. Inflections in the cumulative distributionnear 6 d, 14, d, and 45 d, suggest key physical scales of ~0.2, ~0.4, and ~1A.U. where yet-to-be-identified phenomena create distinct features. No singlepower law provides a statistically compelling prescription, but if features areignored, a power law with exponent beta = -0.22 provides a crude approximationover P=1.4 -- 2000 d, as does a piece-wise linear function with a break near 45d. The cumulative period distribution flattens at P > 45 d, even aftercorrection for completeness, indicating either a lower binary fraction or ashift toward low-mass companions. A high degree of similarity (91% likelihood)between the Cyg OB2 period distribution and that of other surveys suggests thatthe binary properties at P<25 d are determined by local physics of disk/clumpfragmentation and are relatively insensitive to environmental and evolutionaryfactors. Fully 30% of the unbiased parent sample is a binary with period P < 45d. Completeness corrections imply a binary fraction near 55% for P < 5000 d.The observed distribution of mass ratios 0.2<q<1 is consistent with uniform,while the observed distribution of eccentricities 0.1<e<0.6 is consistent withuniform plus an excess of e ~ 0 systems. We identify six stars, allsupergiants, that exhibit aperiodic velocity variations of ~30 km/s attributedto atmospheric fluctuations.
