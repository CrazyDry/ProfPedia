Performance Guarantees for Distributed Reachability Queries

  In the real world a graph is often fragmented and distributed acrossdifferent sites. This highlights the need for evaluating queries on distributedgraphs. This paper proposes distributed evaluation algorithms for three classesof queries: reachability for determining whether one node can reach another,bounded reachability for deciding whether there exists a path of a boundedlength between a pair of nodes, and regular reachability for checking whetherthere exists a path connecting two nodes such that the node labels on the pathform a string in a given regular expression. We develop these algorithms basedon partial evaluation, to explore parallel computation. When evaluating a queryQ on a distributed graph G, we show that these algorithms possess the followingperformance guarantees, no matter how G is fragmented and distributed: (1) eachsite is visited only once; (2) the total network traffic is determined by thesize of Q and the fragmentation of G, independent of the size of G; and (3) theresponse time is decided by the largest fragment of G rather than the entire G.In addition, we show that these algorithms can be readily implemented in theMapReduce framework. Using synthetic and real-life data, we experimentallyverify that these algorithms are scalable on large graphs, regardless of howthe graphs are distributed.

Elastic Properties of Chemical-Vapor-Deposited Monolayer MoS2, WS2, and  Their Bilayer Heterostructures

  Elastic properties of materials are an important factor in their integrationin applications. Chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer semiconductors areproposed as key components in industrial-scale flexible devices and buildingblocks of 2D van der Waals heterostructures. However, their mechanical andelastic properties have not been fully characterized. Here we report high 2Delastic moduli of CVD monolayer MoS2 and WS2 (~ 170 N/m), which is very closeto the value of exfoliated MoS2 monolayers and almost half the value of thestrongest material, graphene. The 2D moduli of their bilayer heterostructuresare lower than the sum of 2D modulus of each layer, but comparable to thecorresponding bilayer homostructure, implying similar interactions between thehetero monolayers as between homo monolayers. These results not only providedeep insight to understanding interlayer interactions in 2D van der Waalsstructures, but also potentially allow engineering of their elastic propertiesas desired.

Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Atomically Thin MoS2/WS2 Heterostructures

  Van der Waals heterostructures have recently emerged as a new class ofmaterials, where quantum coupling between stacked atomically thintwo-dimensional (2D) layers, including graphene, hexagonal-boron nitride, andtransition metal dichalcogenides (MX2), give rise to fascinating new phenomena.MX2 heterostructures are particularly exciting for novel optoelectronic andphotovoltaic applications, because 2D MX2 monolayers can have an opticalbandgap in the near-infrared to visible spectral range and exhibit extremelystrong light-matter interactions. Theory predicts that many stacked MX2heterostructures form type-II semiconductor heterojunctions that facilitateefficient electron-hole separation for light detection and harvesting. Here wereport the first experimental observation of ultrafast charge transfer inphoto-excited MoS2/WS2 heterostructures using both photoluminescence mappingand femtosecond (fs) pump-probe spectroscopy. We show that hole transfer fromthe MoS2 layer to the WS2 layer takes place within 50 fs after opticalexcitation, a remarkable rate for van der Waals coupled 2D layers. Suchultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures can enable novel 2Ddevices for optoelectronics and light harvesting.

Inferring the Underlying Structure of Information Cascades

  In social networks, information and influence diffuse among users ascascades. While the importance of studying cascades has been recognized invarious applications, it is difficult to observe the complete structure ofcascades in practice. Moreover, much less is known on how to infer cascadesbased on partial observations. In this paper we study the cascade inferenceproblem following the independent cascade model, and provide a full treatmentfrom complexity to algorithms: (a) We propose the idea of consistent trees asthe inferred structures for cascades; these trees connect source nodes andobserved nodes with paths satisfying the constraints from the observed temporalinformation. (b) We introduce metrics to measure the likelihood of consistenttrees as inferred cascades, as well as several optimization problems forfinding them. (c) We show that the decision problems for consistent trees arein general NP-complete, and that the optimization problems are hard toapproximate. (d) We provide approximation algorithms with performanceguarantees on the quality of the inferred cascades, as well as heuristics. Weexperimentally verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our inferencealgorithms, using real and synthetic data.

Learning to Speed Up Query Planning in Graph Databases

  Querying graph structured data is a fundamental operation that enablesimportant applications including knowledge graph search, social networkanalysis, and cyber-network security. However, the growing size of real-worlddata graphs poses severe challenges for graph databases to meet theresponse-time requirements of the applications. Planning the computationalsteps of query processing - Query Planning - is central to address thesechallenges. In this paper, we study the problem of learning to speedup queryplanning in graph databases towards the goal of improving thecomputational-efficiency of query processing via training queries.We present aLearning to Plan (L2P) framework that is applicable to a large class of queryreasoners that follow the Threshold Algorithm (TA) approach. First, we define ageneric search space over candidate query plans, and identify target searchtrajectories (query plans) corresponding to the training queries by performingan expensive search. Subsequently, we learn greedy search control knowledge toimitate the search behavior of the target query plans. We provide a concreteinstantiation of our L2P framework for STAR, a state-of-the-art graph queryreasoner. Our experiments on benchmark knowledge graphs including DBpedia,YAGO, and Freebase show that using the query plans generated by the learnedsearch control knowledge, we can significantly improve the speed of STAR withnegligible loss in accuracy.

GP-CNAS: Convolutional Neural Network Architecture Search with Genetic  Programming

  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective at solving difficultproblems like visual recognition, speech recognition and natural languageprocessing. However, performance gain comes at the cost of laborioustrial-and-error in designing deeper CNN architectures. In this paper, a geneticprogramming (GP) framework for convolutional neural network architecturesearch, abbreviated as GP-CNAS, is proposed to automatically search for optimalCNN architectures. GP-CNAS encodes CNNs as trees where leaf nodes (GPterminals) are selected residual blocks and non-leaf nodes (GP functions)specify the block assembling procedure. Our tree-based representation enableseasy design and flexible implementation of genetic operators. Specifically, wedesign a dynamic crossover operator that strikes a balance between explorationand exploitation, which emphasizes CNN complexity at early stage and CNNdiversity at later stage. Therefore, the desired CNN architecture with balanceddepth and width can be found within limited trials. Moreover, our GP-CNASframework is highly compatible with other manually-designed and NAS-generatedblock types as well. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show thatGP-CNAS is competitive among the state-of-the-art automatic and semi-automaticNAS algorithms.

Can Sophisticated Dispatching Strategy Acquired by Reinforcement  Learning? - A Case Study in Dynamic Courier Dispatching System

  In this paper, we study a courier dispatching problem (CDP) raised from anonline pickup-service platform of Alibaba. The CDP aims to assign a set ofcouriers to serve pickup requests with stochastic spatial and temporal arrivalrate among urban regions. The objective is to maximize the revenue of servedrequests given a limited number of couriers over a period of time. Many onlinealgorithms such as dynamic matching and vehicle routing strategy from existingliterature could be applied to tackle this problem. However, these methods relyon appropriately predefined optimization objectives at each decision point,which is hard in dynamic situations. This paper formulates the CDP as a Markovdecision process (MDP) and proposes a data-driven approach to derive theoptimal dispatching rule-set under different scenarios. Our method stacksmulti-layer images of the spatial-and-temporal map and apply multi-agentreinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to evolve dispatching models. Thismethod solves the learning inefficiency caused by traditional centralized MDPmodeling. Through comprehensive experiments on both artificial dataset andreal-world dataset, we show: 1) By utilizing historical data and consideringlong-term revenue gains, MARL achieves better performance than myopic onlinealgorithms; 2) MARL is able to construct the mapping between complex scenariosto sophisticated decisions such as the dispatching rule. 3) MARL has thescalability to adopt in large-scale real-world scenarios.

First dark matter search results from the PandaX-I experiment

  We report on the first dark-matter (DM) search results from PandaX-I, a lowthreshold dual-phase xenon experiment operating at the China JinpingUnderground Laboratory. In the 37-kg liquid xenon target with 17.4 live-days ofexposure, no DM particle candidate event was found. This result sets astringent limit for low-mass DM particles and disfavors the interpretation ofpreviously-reported positive experimental results. The minimum upper limit,$3.7\times10^{-44}$\,cm$^2$, for the spin-independent isoscalarDM-particle-nucleon scattering cross section is obtained at a DM-particle massof 49\,GeV/c$^2$ at 90\% confidence level.

Low-mass dark matter search results from full exposure of PandaX-I  experiment

  We report the results of a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) darkmatter search using the full 80.1\;live-day exposure of the first stage of thePandaX experiment (PandaX-I) located in the China Jin-Ping UndergroundLaboratory. The PandaX-I detector has been optimized for detecting low-massWIMPs, achieving a photon detection efficiency of 9.6\%. With a fiducial liquidxenon target mass of 54.0\,kg, no significant excess event were found above theexpected background. A profile likelihood analysis confirms our earlier findingthat the PandaX-I data disfavor all positive low-mass WIMP signals reported inthe literature under standard assumptions. A stringent bound on the low massWIMP is set at WIMP mass below 10\,GeV/c$^2$, demonstrating that liquid xenondetectors can be competitive for low-mass WIMP searches.

Measurement of azimuthal asymmetries in inclusive charged dipion  production in $e^+e^-$ annihilations at $\sqrt{s}$ = 3.65 GeV

  We present a measurement of the azimuthal asymmetries of two charged pions inthe inclusive process $e^+e^-\rightarrow \pi\pi X$ based on a data set of 62$\rm{pb}^{-1}$ at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=3.65$ GeV collected withthe BESIII detector. These asymmetries can be attributed to the Collinsfragmentation function. We observe a nonzero asymmetry, which increases withincreasing pion momentum. As our energy scale is close to that of the existingsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experimental data, the measuredasymmetries are important inputs for the global analysis of extracting thequark transversity distribution inside the nucleon and are valuable to explorethe energy evolution of the spin-dependent fragmentation function.

Search for the Radiative Leptonic Decay $D^{+}\to γe^{+}  ν_{e}$

  Using an electron-positron collision data sample of 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ collectedat a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=3.773$ GeV with the BESIII detector, wepresent the first search for the radiative leptonic decay $D^{+} \rightarrow\gamma e^{+}{\nu}_{e}$. The analysis is performed with a double tag method. Wedo not observe a significant $D^{+} \rightarrow \gamma e^{+}{\nu}_{e}$ signal,and obtain an upper limit on the branching fraction of $D^{+} \rightarrow\gamma e^{+}{\nu}_{e}$ decay with the energy of radiative photon larger than 10MeV of $3.0\times10^{-5}$ at the 90% confidence level.

Measurement of $y_{CP}$ in $D^0-\overline{D}^0$ oscillation using  quantum correlations in $e^+e^-\to D^0\overline{D}^0$ at $\sqrt{s}$ =  3.773\,GeV

  We report a measurement of the parameter $y_{CP}$ in$\ensuremath{D^0}\xspace-\ensuremath{\overline{D}^{0}}\xspace$ oscillationsperformed by taking advantage of quantum coherence between pairs of$\ensuremath{D^0}\xspace \ensuremath{\overline{D}^{0}}\xspace$ mesons producedin $e^+e^-$ annihilations near threshold. In this work, doubly-tagged$\ensuremath{D^0}\xspace \ensuremath{\overline{D}^{0}}\xspace$ events, whereone $D$ decays to a $CP$ eigenstate and the other $D$ decays in a semileptonicmode, are reconstructed using a data sample of 2.92\,fb$^{-1}$ collected withthe BESIII detector at the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 3.773\,GeV. Weobtain $y_{CP} = (-2.0\pm1.3\pm0.7)\%$, where the first uncertainty isstatistical and the second is systematic. This result is compatible with thecurrent world average.
