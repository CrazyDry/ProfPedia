  In present work, we find a class of Lie algebras, which are defined from thesymmetrizable generalized intersection matrices. However, such algebras aredifferent from generalized intersection matrix algebras and intersection matrixalgebras. Moreover, such Lie algebras generated by semi-positive definitematrices can be classified by the modified Dynkin diagrams.

MIMO UWB Radar System with Compressive Sensing

  A multiple input multiple output ultra-wideband cognitive radar based oncompressive sensing is presented in this letter. For traditional UWB radar,high sampling rate analog to digital converter at the receiver is required tomeet Shannon theorem, which increases hardware complexity. In order to bypassthe bottleneck of ADC or further increase the radar bandwidth using the latestwideband ADC, we propose to exploit CS for signal reconstruction at thereceiver of UWB radar for the sparse targets in the surveillance area. Besides,the function of narrowband interference cancellation is integrated into theproposed MIMO UWB radar. The field demonstration proves the feasibility andreliability of the proposed algorithm.

  In this paper, we use the Fokas method to analyze the complexSharma-Tasso-Olver(cSTO) equation on the half line. We show that it can berepresented in terms of the solution of a matrix RHP formulated in the plane ofthe complex spectral parameter {\lambda}.

The coupled modified nonlinear Schrödinger equations on the  half-line via the Fokas method

  Coupled modified nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger(CMNLS) equations describe thepulse propagation in the picosecond or femtosecond regime of the birefringentoptical fibers. In this paper, we use the Fokas method to analyze theinitial-boundary value problem for the CMNLS equations on the half-line. Assumethat the solution u(x,t) and v(x,t) of CMNLS equations are exists, and we showthat it can be expressed in terms of the unique solution of a matrixRiemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the plane of the complex spectralparameter {\lambda}.

  In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem of theKundu-Eckhaus equation on the half-line by using of the Fokas unified transformmethod. Assuming that the solution $u(x,t)$ exists, we show that it can beexpressed in terms of the unique solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problemformulated in the plane of the complex spectral parameter $\lambda$. Moreover,we also get there exist spectral functions are not independent and they aresatisfying the so-called global relation.

Hölder continuity of the solutions to a class of SPDEs arising from  multidimensional superprocesses in random environment

  We consider a $d$-dimensional branching particle system in a randomenvironment. Suppose that the initial measures converge weakly to a measurewith bounded density. Under the Mytnik-Sturm branching mechanism, we prove thatthe corresponding empirical measure $X_t^n$ converges weakly in the Skorohodspace $D([0,T];M_F(\mathbb{R}^d))$ and the limit has a density $u_t(x)$, where$M_F(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is the space of finite measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We alsoderive a stochastic partial differential equation $u_t(x)$ satisfies. By usingthe techniques of Malliavin calculus, we prove that $u_t(x)$ is jointlyH\"{o}lder continuous in time with exponent $\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$ and in spacewith exponent $1-\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$.

  The unified transform method is used to analyze the initial-boundary valueproblem for the coupled derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger(CDNLS) equations onthe half-line. In this paper, we assume that the solution $u(x,t)$ and $v(x,t)$of CDNLS equations are exists, and we show that it can be expressed in terms ofthe unique solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the planeof the complex spectral parameter $\lambda$.

Magnetisms in $p$-type monolayer gallium chalcogenides (GaSe, GaS)

  Magnetisms in $p$-type monolayer GaX (X=S,Se) is investigated by performingdensity-functional calculations. Due to the large density of states near thevalence band edge, these monolayer semiconductors are ferromagnetic within asmall range of hole doping. The intrinsic Ga vacancies can promote localmagnetic moment while Se vacancies cannot. Magnetic coupling betweenvacancy-induced local moments is ferromagnetic and surprisingly long-range. Theresults indicate that magnetization can be induced by hole doping and can betuned by controlled defect generation.

Isogeometric analysis of thin Reissner-Mindlin plates and shells:  locking phenomena and B-bar method

  We propose a local type of B-bar formulation, addressing locking indegenerated Reissner-Mindlin plate and shell formulations in the context ofisogeometric analysis. Parasitic strain components are projected onto thephysical space locally, i.e. at the element level, using a least-squaresapproach. The formulation allows the flexible utilization of basis functions ofdifferent order as the projection bases. The present formulation is muchcheaper computationally than the classical $\bar{B}$ method. We show thenumerical consistency of the scheme through numerical examples, moreover theyshow that the proposed formulation alleviates locking and yields good accuracyeven for slenderness ratios of $1 \times 10^5$, and has the ability to capturedeformations of thin shells using relatively coarse meshes. In addition it canbe opined that the proposed method is less sensitive to locking and meshdistortion.

Extraction of crystal-field parameters for lanthanide ions from  quantum-chemical calculations

  A simple method for constructing effective Hamiltonians for the 4fN and4fN-15d energy levels of lanthanide ions in crystals from quantum-chemicalcalculations is presented. The method is demonstrated by deriving crystal-fieldand spin-orbit parameters for Ce3+ ions doped in LiYF4, Cs2NaYCl6, CaF2, KY3F10and YAG host crystals from quantum chemical calculations based on theDV-X{\alpha} method. Good agreement between calculated and fitted values of thecrystal-field parameters is obtained. The method can be used to calculateparameters even for low-symmetry sites where there are more parameters thanenergy levels.

Feynman-Kac formula for fractional heat equation driven by fractional  white noise

  In this paper we obtain a Feynman-Kac formula for the solution of afractional stochastic heat equation driven by fractional noise. One of the maindifficulties is to show the exponential integrability of some singularnonlinear functionals of symmetric stable L\'evy motion. This difficulty willbe overcome by a technique developed in the framework of large deviation. ThisFeynman-Kac formula is applied to obtain the H\"older continuity and momentformula of the solution.

Three-dimensional Critical Dirac semimetal in KMgBi

  We predicted that AMgBi (A=K,Rb Cs), which have the same lattice structuresas the 111 family of iron-based superconductors (Na/LiFeAs), aresymmetry-protected Dirac semimetals located near the boundary of type-I andtype-II Dirac semimetal phases. Doping Rb or Cs into KMgBi can drive thetransition between the two phases. The materials can also be turned into Weylsemimetals and topological insulators by explicitly or spontaneously breakingtime-reversal symmetry and C$_4$ lattice symmetry respectively.

Techniques for Interpretable Machine Learning

  Interpretable machine learning tackles the important problem that humanscannot understand the behaviors of complex machine learning models and howthese models arrive at a particular decision. Although many approaches havebeen proposed, a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and challengesis still lacking. We provide a survey covering existing techniques to increasethe interpretability of machine learning models. We also discuss crucial issuesthat the community should consider in future work such as designinguser-friendly explanations and developing comprehensive evaluation metrics tofurther push forward the area of interpretable machine learning.

Ghost imaging LiDAR via sparsity constraints using push-broom scanning

  Ghost imaging LiDAR via sparsity constraints using push-broom scanning isproposed. It can image the stationary target scene continuously along thescanning direction by taking advantage of the relative movement between theplatform and the target scene. Compared to conventional ghost imaging LiDARthat requires multiple speckle patterns staring the target, ghost imaging LiDARvia sparsity constraints using push-broom scanning not only simplifies theimaging system, but also reduces the sampling number. Numerical simulations andexperiments have demonstrated its efficiency.

Temperature dependence of the light yield of the LAB-based and  mesitylene-based liquid scintillators

  We studied the temperature dependence of the light yield of the linear alkylbenzene (LAB)-based and mesitylene-based liquid scintillators. The light yieldincreases by 23% for both liquid scintillators when the temperature is loweredfrom $26\;^{\circ}$C to $-40\;^{\circ }$C, correcting for the temperatureresponse of the photomultiplier tube. The measurements help to understand theenergy response of the liquid scintillator detectors. Especially, the nextgeneration reactor neutrino experiments for neutrino mass hierarchy, such asthe Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), require very high energyresolution. As no apparent degradation on the liquid scintillator transparencywas observed, lowering the operation temperature of the detector to$\sim4\;^\circ$C will increase the photoelectron yield of the detector by 13%,combining the light yield increase of the liquid scintillator and the quantumefficiency increase of the photomultiplier tubes.

Hybrid Crystals of Cuprates and Iron-Based Superconductors

  We propose two possible new compounds, Ba$_2$CuO$_2$Fe$_2$As$_2$ andK$_2$CuO$_2$Fe$_2$Se$_2$, which hybridize the building blocks of two hightemperature superconductors, cuprates and iron-based superconductors. Thesecompounds consist of square CuO$_2$ layers and antifluorite-type Fe$_2$X$_2$(X=As,Se) layers separated by Ba/K. The calculations of binding energies andphonon spectrums indicate that they are dynamically stable, which ensures thatthey may be experimentally synthesized. The Fermi surfaces and electronicstructures of the two compounds inherit the characteristics of both cupratesand iron-based superconductors. These compounds can be superconductors withintriguing physical properties to help to determine pairing mechanisms of high$T_c$ superconductivity.

Topological phase in non-centrosymmetric material NaSnBi

  We predict that a non-centrosymmetric material NaSnBi locates in athree-dimensional non-trivial topological phase under ambient pressure based onfirst-principle calculations. By deriving the effective model around $\Gamma$point, we find that the topological phase transition is driven by a Rashbaspin-orbital coupling through an odd number of pairs of band touch because of asmall anisotropic gap caused by quintic dispersion terms. In contrast toconventional topological insulators, the spin texture of surface Dirac cone isright-handed and the surface states are strikingly different for differentsurface terminations.

Localized Control of Curie Temperature in Perovskite Oxide Film by  Capping-layer- induced Octahedral Distortion

  With reduced dimensionality, it is often easier to modify the properties ofultra-thin films than their bulk counterparts. Strain engineering, usuallyachieved by choosing appropriate substrates, has been proven effective incontrolling the properties of perovskite oxide films. An emerging alternativeroute for developing new multifunctional perovskite is by modification of theoxygen octahedral structure. Here we report the control of structural oxygenoctahedral rotation in ultra-thin perovskite SrRuO3 films by the deposition ofa SrTiO3 capping layer, which can be lithographically patterned to achievelocal control. Using a scanning Sagnac magnetic microscope, we show increase inthe Curie temperature of SrRuO3 due to the suppression octahedral rotationsrevealed by the synchrotron x-ray diffraction. This capping-layer-basedtechnique may open new possibilities for developing functional oxide materials.

The coupled Fokas-Lenells equations by a Riemann-Hilbert approach

  In this paper, we use the unified transform method to consider theinitial-boundary value problem for the coupled Fokas-Lenells equations on thehalf-line, assuming that the solution $\{q(x,t),r(x,t)\}$ of the coupledFokas-Lenells equations exists, we show that $\{q_x(x,t),r_x(x,t)\}$ can beexpressed in terms of the unique solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problemformulated in the plane of the complex spectral parameter $\lambda$. Thus, thesolution $\{q(x,t),r(x,t)\}$ can be obtained by integration with respect to$x$.

An initial-boundary value problem for the coupled focusing-defocusing  complex short pulse equation with a $4\times4$ Lax pair

  In this paper we investigate the coupled focusing-defocusing complex shortpulse equation, which describe the propagation of ultra-short optical pulses incubic nonlinear media. Through the unified transform method, theinitial-boundary value problem for the coupled focusing-defocusing complexshort pulse equation with $4\times 4$ Lax pair on the half-line are to beanalyzed. Assuming that the solution $\{q_1(x,t),q_2(x,t)\}$ of the coupledfocusing-defocusing complex short pulse equation exists, we show that$\{q_{1,x}(x,t),q_{2,x}(x,t)\}$ can be expressed in terms of the uniquesolution of a $4\times 4$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem formulated in thecomplex $\lambda$-plane. Thus, the solution $\{q_1(x,t),q_2(x,t)\}$ can beobtained by integration with respect to $x$. Moreover, we also get that somespectral functions are not independent and satisfy the so-called globalrelation.

Long short-term memory networks in memristor crossbars

  Recent breakthroughs in recurrent deep neural networks with long short-termmemory (LSTM) units has led to major advances in artificial intelligence.State-of-the-art LSTM models with significantly increased complexity and alarge number of parameters, however, have a bottleneck in computing powerresulting from limited memory capacity and data communication bandwidth. Herewe demonstrate experimentally that LSTM can be implemented with a memristorcrossbar, which has a small circuit footprint to store a large number ofparameters and in-memory computing capability that circumvents the 'von Neumannbottleneck'. We illustrate the capability of our system by solving real-worldproblems in regression and classification, which shows that memristor LSTM is apromising low-power and low-latency hardware platform for edge inference.

AID++: An Updated Version of AID on Scene Classification

  Aerial image scene classification is a fundamental problem for understandinghigh-resolution remote sensing images and has become an active research task inthe field of remote sensing due to its important role in a wide range ofapplications. However, the limitations of existing datasets for sceneclassification, such as the small scale and low-diversity, severely hamper thepotential usage of the new generation deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs). Although huge efforts have been made in building large-scale datasetsvery recently, e.g., the Aerial Image Dataset (AID) which contains 10,000 imagesamples, they are still far from sufficient to fully train a high-capacity deepCNN model. To this end, we present a larger-scale dataset in this paper, namedas AID++, for aerial scene classification based on the AID dataset. Theproposed AID++ consists of more than 400,000 image samples that aresemi-automatically annotated by using the existing the geographical data. Weevaluate several prevalent CNN models on the proposed dataset, and the resultsshow that our dataset can be used as a promising benchmark for sceneclassification.

Recent advances and opportunities in scene classification of aerial  images with deep models

  Scene classification is a fundamental task in interpretation of remotesensing images, and has become an active research topic in remote sensingcommunity due to its important role in a wide range of applications. Over thepast years, tremendous efforts have been made for developing powerfulapproaches for scene classification of remote sensing images, evolving from thetraditional bag-of-visual-words model to the new generation deep convolutionalneural networks (CNNs). The deep CNN based methods have exhibited remarkablebreakthrough on performance, dramatically outperforming previous methods whichstrongly rely on hand-crafted features. However, performance with deep CNNs hasgradually plateaued on existing public scene datasets, due to the notabledrawbacks of these datasets, such as the small scale and low-diversity oftraining samples. Therefore, to promote the development of new methods and movethe scene classification task a step further, we deeply discuss the existingproblems in scene classification task, and accordingly present three opendirections. We believe these potential directions will be instructive for theresearchers in this field.

Accurate Building Detection in VHR Remote Sensing Images using Geometric  Saliency

  This paper aims to address the problem of detecting buildings from remotesensing images with very high resolution (VHR). Inspired by the observationthat buildings are always more distinguishable in geometries than in texture orspectral, we propose a new geometric building index (GBI) for accurate buildingdetection, which relies on the geometric saliency of building structures. Thegeometric saliency of buildings is derived from a mid-level geometricrepresentations based on meaningful junctions that can locally describeanisotropic geometrical structures of images. The resulting GBI is measured byintegrating the derived geometric saliency of buildings. Experiments on threepublic datasets demonstrate that the proposed GBI achieves very promisingperformance, and meanwhile shows impressive generalization capability.

A Group Variational Transformation Neural Network for Fractional  Interpolation of Video Coding

  Motion compensation is an important technology in video coding to remove thetemporal redundancy between coded video frames. In motion compensation,fractional interpolation is used to obtain more reference blocks at sub-pixellevel. Existing video coding standards commonly use fixed interpolation filtersfor fractional interpolation, which are not efficient enough to handle diversevideo signals well. In this paper, we design a group variational transformationconvolutional neural network (GVTCNN) to improve the fractional interpolationperformance of the luma component in motion compensation. GVTCNN infers samplesat different sub-pixel positions from the input integer-position sample. Itfirst extracts a shared feature map from the integer-position sample to infervarious sub-pixel position samples. Then a group variational transformationtechnique is used to transform a group of copied shared feature maps to samplesat different sub-pixel positions. Experimental results have identified theinterpolation efficiency of our GVTCNN. Compared with the interpolation methodof High Efficiency Video Coding, our method achieves 1.9% bit saving on averageand up to 5.6% bit saving under low-delay P configuration.

Unconventional Flatband Line States in Photonic Lieb Lattices

  Flatband systems typically host "compact localized states"(CLS) due todestructive interference and macroscopic degeneracy of Bloch wave functionsassociated with a dispersionless energy band. Using a photonic Lieblattice(LL), we show that conventional localized flatband states are inherentlyincomplete, with the missing modes manifested as extended line states whichform non-contractible loops winding around the entire lattice. Experimentally,we develop a continuous-wave laser writing technique to establish afinite-sized photonic LL with specially-tailored boundaries, thereby directlyobserve the unusually extended flatband line states.Such unconventional linestates cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the previously observedCLS but rather arise from the nontrivial real-space topology.The robustness ofthe line states to imperfect excitation conditions is discussed, and theirpotential applications are illustrated.

AID: A Benchmark Dataset for Performance Evaluation of Aerial Scene  Classification

  Aerial scene classification, which aims to automatically label an aerialimage with a specific semantic category, is a fundamental problem forunderstanding high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In recent years, it hasbecome an active task in remote sensing area and numerous algorithms have beenproposed for this task, including many machine learning and data-drivenapproaches. However, the existing datasets for aerial scene classification likeUC-Merced dataset and WHU-RS19 are with relatively small sizes, and the resultson them are already saturated. This largely limits the development of sceneclassification algorithms. This paper describes the Aerial Image Dataset (AID):a large-scale dataset for aerial scene classification. The goal of AID is toadvance the state-of-the-arts in scene classification of remote sensing images.For creating AID, we collect and annotate more than ten thousands aerial sceneimages. In addition, a comprehensive review of the existing aerial sceneclassification techniques as well as recent widely-used deep learning methodsis given. Finally, we provide a performance analysis of typical aerial sceneclassification and deep learning approaches on AID, which can be served as thebaseline results on this benchmark.

Pristine graphene as a catalyst in reactions with organics containing  C=O bonds

  Pristine graphene is thought lack of catalytic activity up to date, althoughusing graphene-plus-heteroatom materials as catalysts has become a subject ofintensive research because it can be metal saving, eco-friendly and ultimatelysustainable. Here we report observations of catalytic reactions ofhigh-quality, clean, pristine graphene when immersed into organics containingC=O bonds, like acetone, acetic acid and acetaldehyde. The C=O bonds were foundto break and form polymers including polyethers. The reaction rate is highlytemperature dependent. The reaction products mainly physically adsorb ongraphene and do not cause increase of defect density in graphene, hencegraphene retains its intrinsic properties. This new catalysis shall not onlyfind practical importance but also deepen our understanding on the role ofgraphene in all graphene based catalysis.

Exact and Consistent Interpretation for Piecewise Linear Neural  Networks: A Closed Form Solution

  Strong intelligent machines powered by deep neural networks are increasinglydeployed as black boxes to make decisions in risk-sensitive domains, such asfinance and medical. To reduce potential risk and build trust with users, it iscritical to interpret how such machines make their decisions. Existing worksinterpret a pre-trained neural network by analyzing hidden neurons, mimickingpre-trained models or approximating local predictions. However, these methodsdo not provide a guarantee on the exactness and consistency of theirinterpretation. In this paper, we propose an elegant closed form solution named$OpenBox$ to compute exact and consistent interpretations for the family ofPiecewise Linear Neural Networks (PLNN). The major idea is to first transform aPLNN into a mathematically equivalent set of linear classifiers, then interpreteach linear classifier by the features that dominate its prediction. We furtherapply $OpenBox$ to demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negative and sparseconstraints on improving the interpretability of PLNNs. The extensiveexperiments on both synthetic and real world data sets clearly demonstrate theexactness and consistency of our interpretation.

Type-II Dirac photons at the metasurfaces

  Topological characteristics of energy bands, such as Dirac/Weyl nodes, haveattracted substantial interest in condensed matter systems as well as inclassical wave systems. Among these energy bands, the type-II Dirac point is anodal degeneracy with tilted conical dispersion, leading to a peculiar crossingdispersion in the constant energy plane. Such nodal points have recently beenfound in electronic materials. The analogous topological feature in photonicsystems remains a theoretical curiosity, with experimental realization expectedto be challenging. Here, we experimentally realize the type-II Dirac pointusing a planar metasurface architecture, where the band degeneracy point isprotected by the underlying mirror symmetry of the metasurface. Gapless edgemodes are found and measured at the boundary between the different domains ofthe symmetry-broken metasurface. Our work shows that metasurfaces are simpleand practical platforms for realizing electromagnetic type-II Dirac points, andtheir planar structure is a distinct advantage that facilitates applications intwo-dimensional topological photonics.

Large Band Gap Quantum Anomalous Hall Phase in Hexagonal Organometallic  Frameworks

  The nontrivial band gap plays a critical role in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)insulators. In this work, we propose that the intrinsic QAH phase with sizableband gaps up to 367 meV is achieved in two-dimensional hexagonal organometallicframeworks (HOMFs). Based on first-principles calculations and effective modelanalysis, we uncover that these large band gaps in transition metal based HOMFsare opened by strong spin-orbital coupling of the localized 4d or 5d electrons.Importantly, we reveal that Coulomb correlations can further significantlyenhance the nontrivial band gaps. In addition, we suggest a possible avenue togrow these organometallic QAH insulators on a semiconducting SiC(111)substrate, and the topological features are perfectly preserved due to the vander Waals interaction. Our work shows that the correlation remarkably enhancesthe nontrivial band gaps, providing exotic candidates to realize the QAH statesat high temperatures.

Topological Vortex Phase Transitions in Iron-Based Superconductors

  We study topological vortex phases in iron-based superconductors. Besides thepreviously known vortex end Majorana zero modes (MZMs) phase stemming from theexistence of a three dimensional (3D) strong topological insulator state, weshow that there is another topologically nontrivial phase as iron-basedsuperconductors can be doped superconducting 3D weak topological insulators(WTIs). The vortex bound states in a superconducting 3D WTI exhibit twodifferent types of quantum states, a robust nodal superconducting phase withpairs of bulk MZMs and a full-gap topologically nontrivial superconductingphase which has single vortex end MZM in a certain range of doping level.Moreover, we predict and summarize various topological phases in iron-basedsuperconductors, and find that carrier doping and interlayer coupling can drivesystems to have phase transitions between these different topological phases.

Palladium Diselenide Long-Wavelength Infrared Photodetector with High  Sensitivity and Stability

  A long-wavelength infrared (IR) photodetector based on two-dimensionalmaterials working at room temperature would have wide applications in manyaspects in remote sensing, thermal imaging, biomedical optics, and medicalimaging. However, sub-bandgap light detection in graphene and black phosphorushas been a long-standing scientific challenge because of low photoresponsivity,instability in the air and highdark current. In this study, we report a highlysensitive, air-stable and operable long-wavelength infrared photodetector atroom temperature based on PdSe2 phototransistors and its heterostructure. Ahigh photoresponsivity of ~42.1 AW-1 (at 10.6 {\mu}m) was demonstrated, whichis an order of magnitude higher than the current record of platinum diselenide.Moreover, the dark current and noise power density were suppressed effectivelyby fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure. This work fundamentallycontributes to establishing long-wavelength infrared detection by PdSe2 at theforefront of long-IR two-dimensional-materials-based photonics.

Harmonic mean curvature flow and geometric inequalities

  In this article, we will use the harmonic mean curvature flow to prove a newclass of Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities for strictly convex hypersurfacesin hyperbolic space in terms of total curvature, which is the integral ofGaussian curvature on the hypersurface. We will also use the harmonic meancurvature flow to prove a new class of geometric inequalities forhorospherically convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. Using these newAlexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities and the inverse mean curvature flow, weobtain an Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality for strictly convex hypersurfaces inhyperbolic space, which was previously proved for horospherically convexhypersurfaces by Wang and Xia [44]. Finally, we use the mean curvature flow toprove a new Heintze-Karcher type inequality for hypersurfaces with positiveRicci curvature in hyperbolic space.

A quantum algorithm for evolving open quantum dynamics on quantum  computing devices

  Designing quantum algorithms for simulating quantum systems has seen enormousprogress in the recent years, yet relatively few studies have been done todevelop quantum algorithms for non-unitary open quantum dynamics despite itsimportance in modeling the inevitable system-environment interaction found inmost realistic physical models. In this work we propose a general quantumalgorithm to evolve an arbitrary non-unitary dynamics on quantum computingdevices. The initial state in the form of a density matrix can be convertedinto a state vector and the Kraus operators governing the time evolution can beconverted into unitary matrices with minimal dilation guaranteed by theSz.-Nagy theorem. The initial state vector can then be evolved by unitaryquantum gates. We then extract important physical information carried by theevolved density matrix without using quantum tomography. We demonstrate theapplication of our quantum algorithm to an amplitude damping quantum channelusing the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator and the IBM Q 5 Tenerife quantum device.The proposed algorithm does not require particular models of dynamics ordecomposition of the quantum channel, and thus can be easily generalized toother open quantum dynamical models.

Tests of Cold Atom Clock in Orbit

  Since the atomic clock was invented, its performance has been improved forone digit every decade until 90s of last century when the traditional atomicclock almost reached its limit. With laser cooled atoms, the performance can befurther improved, and nowadays the cold atom based clocks are widely used asprimary frequency standards. Such a kind of cold atom clocks has greatapplications in space. This paper presents the design and tests of a cold atomclock (CAC) operating in space. In microgravity, the atoms are cooled, trapped,launched and finally detected after being interrogated by microwave field withRamsey method. The results of laser cooling of atoms in microgravity in orbitare presented and compared with that on ground for the first time. That thefull width at half maximum (FWHM) of obtained central Ramsey fringes varieslinearly with launching velocity of cold atoms shows the effects ofmicrogravity. With appropriate parameters, a closed-loop locking of the CAC isrealized in orbit and the estimated short term frequency stability of$3.0\times 10 ^{-13}/\sqrt{\tau }$ has been reached.

Dense v.s. Sparse: A Comparative Study of Sampling Analysis in Scene  Classification of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery

  Scene classification is a key problem in the interpretation ofhigh-resolution remote sensing imagery. Many state-of-the-art methods, e.g.bag-of-visual-words model and its variants, the topic models as well as deeplearning-based approaches, share similar procedures: patch sampling, featuredescription/learning and classification. Patch sampling is the first and a keyprocedure which has a great influence on the results. In the literature, manydifferent sampling strategies have been used, {e.g. dense sampling, randomsampling, keypoint-based sampling and saliency-based sampling, etc. However, itis still not clear which sampling strategy is suitable for the sceneclassification of high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, wecomparatively study the effects of different sampling strategies under thescenario of scene classification of high-resolution remote sensing images. Wedivide the existing sampling methods into two types: dense sampling and sparsesampling, the later of which includes random sampling, keypoint-based samplingand various saliency-based sampling proposed recently. In order to comparetheir performances, we rely on a standard bag-of-visual-words model toconstruct our testing scheme, owing to their simplicity, robustness andefficiency. The experimental results on two commonly used datasets show thatdense sampling has the best performance among all the strategies but with highspatial and computational complexity, random sampling gives better orcomparable results than other sparse sampling methods, like the sophisticatedmulti-scale key-point operators and the saliency-based methods which areintensively studied and commonly used recently.

Apply Local Clustering Method to Improve the Running Speed of Ant Colony  Optimization

  Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has time complexity O(t*m*N*N), and its typicalapplication is to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where t, m, and Ndenotes the iteration number, number of ants, number of cities respectively.Cutting down running time is one of study focuses, and one way is to decreaseparameter t and N, especially N. For this focus, the following method ispresented in this paper. Firstly, design a novel clustering algorithm namedSpecial Local Clustering algorithm (SLC), then apply it to classify all citiesinto compact classes, where compact class is the class that all cities in thisclass cluster tightly in a small region. Secondly, let ACO act on every classto get a local TSP route. Thirdly, all local TSP routes are jointed to formsolution. Fourthly, the inaccuracy of solution caused by clustering iseliminated. Simulation shows that the presented method improves the runningspeed of ACO by 200 factors at least. And this high speed is benefit from twofactors. One is that class has small size and parameter N is cut down. Theroute length at every iteration step is convergent when ACO acts on compactclass. The other factor is that, using the convergence of route length astermination criterion of ACO and parameter t is cut down.

Collaborative Filtering with Topic and Social Latent Factors  Incorporating Implicit Feedback

  Recommender systems (RSs) provide an effective way of alleviating theinformation overload problem by selecting personalized items for differentusers. Latent factors based collaborative filtering (CF) has become the popularapproaches for RSs due to its accuracy and scalability. Recently, online socialnetworks and user-generated content provide diverse sources for recommendationbeyond ratings. Although {\em social matrix factorization} (Social MF) and {\emtopic matrix factorization} (Topic MF) successfully exploit social relationsand item reviews, respectively, both of them ignore some useful information. Inthis paper, we investigate the effective data fusion by combining theaforementioned approaches. First, we propose a novel model {\em \mbox{MR3}} tojointly model three sources of information (i.e., ratings, item reviews, andsocial relations) effectively for rating prediction by aligning the latentfactors and hidden topics. Second, we incorporate the implicit feedback fromratings into the proposed model to enhance its capability and to demonstrateits flexibility. We achieve more accurate rating prediction on real-lifedatasets over various state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we measure thecontribution from each of the three data sources and the impact of implicitfeedback from ratings, followed by the sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters.Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of our proposedmodel and its extension.

First principles modeling of tunnel magnetoresistance of Fe/MgO/Fe  trilayers

  By carrying out density functional theory analysis within the Keldyshnon-equilibrium Green's functional formalism, we have calculated the nonlinearand non-equilibrium quantum transport properties of Fe/MgO/Fe trilayerstructures as a function of external bias voltage. For well relaxed atomicstructures of the trilayer, the equilibrium tunnel magnetoresistance ratio(TMR) is found to be very large and also fairly stable against small variationsin the atomic structure. As a function of external bias voltage, the TMRreduces monotonically to zero with a voltage scale of about 1V, in agreementwith experimental observations. We present understanding of the nonequilibriumtransport properties by investigating microscopic details of the scatteringstates and the Bloch bands of the Fe leads.

Persistent spin currents in electron systems with spin-orbit interaction

  We investigate the persistent spin currents in one- and two-dimensionalelectron systems with spin-orbit interaction in thermodynamics equilibrium atabsolute zero temperature. The persistent spin current is the intrinsic onewhich is connected with the Berry phases in the configuration spaces of anelectron system and winding numbers in the field configurations of electrons.When the topological space of the configuration of a system has the nontrivialfirst homotopy groups, the persistent spin currents in the system could benonzero and not easily destroyed by impurity scattering in ballistic limit. Thenon-vanishing background spin currents in infinite two-dimensional electronsystem found by Rashba could be realized by the transport persistent spincurrents in a finite torus electron system with spin-orbit interaction. In thissense, we meet the challenge proposed by Rashba.
