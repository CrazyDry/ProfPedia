Temperature-dependent terahertz conductivity of topological insulator  Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.8}$Se$_{1.2}$

  Using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy, we study the temperature-dependentcomplex optical conductivity of the topological insulator,Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.8}$Se$_{1.2}$ single-crystal from 5 K to 150 K inthe terahertz regime (0.4 -- 3.0 THz). We analyze our experimental resultsusing the Drude-Lorentz model, with the Drude component representing themetallic surface state and the Lorentz term representing the bulk insulatingstate. We find the conductivity to be dominated by the Drude contribution,suggesting the presence of metallic surface states. The low-frequency realconductivity follows a thermally-activated behavior. Its origin is alsodiscussed.

Ultrafast carrier phonon dynamics in NaOH-reacted graphite oxide film

  NaOH-reacted graphite oxide film was prepared by decomposing epoxy groups ingraphite oxide into hydroxyl and -ONa groups with NaOH solution. Ultrafastcarrier dynamics of the sample were studied by time-resolved transientdifferential reflection (\DeltaR/R). The data show two exponential relaxationprocesses. The slow relaxation process (\sim2ps) is ascribed to low energyacoustic phonon mediated scattering. The electron-phonon coupling andfirst-principles calculation results demonstrate that - OH and -ONa groups inthe sample are strongly coupled. Thus, we attribute the fast relaxation process(\sim0.17ps) to the coupling of hydroxyl and -ONa groups in the sample.

Terahertz conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene

  Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, the real part of opticalconductivity [$\sigma_{1}(\omega)$] of twisted bilayer graphene was obtained atdifferent temperatures (10 -- 300 K) in the frequency range 0.3 -- 3 THz. Ontop of a Drude-like response, we see a strong peak in $\sigma_{1} (\omega)$ at$\sim$2.7 THz. We analyze the overall Drude-like response using adisorder-dependent (unitary scattering) model, then attribute the peak at 2.7THz to an enhanced density of states at that energy, that is caused by thepresence of a van Hove singularity arising from a commensurate twisting of thetwo graphene layers.

Transfer Learning across Networks for Collective Classification

  This paper addresses the problem of transferring useful knowledge from asource network to predict node labels in a newly formed target network. Whileexisting transfer learning research has primarily focused on vector-based data,in which the instances are assumed to be independent and identicallydistributed, how to effectively transfer knowledge across different informationnetworks has not been well studied, mainly because networks may have theirdistinct node features and link relationships between nodes. In this paper, wepropose a new transfer learning algorithm that attempts to transfer commonlatent structure features across the source and target networks. The proposedalgorithm discovers these latent features by constructing label propagationmatrices in the source and target networks, and mapping them into a sharedlatent feature space. The latent features capture common structure patternsshared by two networks, and serve as domain-independent features to betransferred between networks. Together with domain-dependent node features, wethereafter propose an iterative classification algorithm that leverages labelcorrelations to predict node labels in the target network. Experiments onreal-world networks demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can successfullyachieve knowledge transfer between networks to help improve the accuracy ofclassifying nodes in the target network.

Search Efficient Binary Network Embedding

  Traditional network embedding primarily focuses on learning a dense vectorrepresentation for each node, which encodes network structure and/or nodecontent information, such that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms can beeasily applied to the vector-format node representations for network analysis.However, the learned dense vector representations are inefficient forlarge-scale similarity search, which requires to find the nearest neighbormeasured by Euclidean distance in a continuous vector space. In this paper, wepropose a search efficient binary network embedding algorithm called BinaryNEto learn a sparse binary code for each node, by simultaneously modeling nodecontext relations and node attribute relations through a three-layer neuralnetwork. BinaryNE learns binary node representations efficiently through astochastic gradient descent based online learning algorithm. The learned binaryencoding not only reduces memory usage to represent each node, but also allowsfast bit-wise comparisons to support much quicker network node search comparedto Euclidean distance or other distance measures. Our experiments andcomparisons show that BinaryNE not only delivers more than 23 times fastersearch speed, but also provides comparable or better search quality thantraditional continuous vector based network embedding methods.

Network Representation Learning: A Survey

  With the widespread use of information technologies, information networks arebecoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across variousdisciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, telecommunicationnetworks, and biological networks. Analyzing these networks sheds light ondifferent aspects of social life such as the structure of societies,information diffusion, and communication patterns. In reality, however, thelarge scale of information networks often makes network analytic taskscomputationally expensive or intractable. Network representation learning hasbeen recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network verticesinto a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure,vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the originalnetwork to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. Inthis survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature onnetwork representation learning in the data mining and machine learning field.We propose new taxonomies to categorize and summarize the state-of-the-artnetwork representation learning techniques according to the underlying learningmechanisms, the network information intended to preserve, as well as thealgorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize evaluation protocols usedfor validating network representation learning including published benchmarkdatasets, evaluation methods, and open source algorithms. We also performempirical studies to compare the performance of representative algorithms oncommon datasets, and analyze their computational complexity. Finally, wesuggest promising research directions to facilitate future study.

MetaGraph2Vec: Complex Semantic Path Augmented Heterogeneous Network  Embedding

  Network embedding in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is achallenging task, due to complications of different node types and richrelationships between nodes. As a result, conventional network embeddingtechniques cannot work on such HINs. Recently, metapath-based approaches havebeen proposed to characterize relationships in HINs, but they are ineffectivein capturing rich contexts and semantics between nodes for embedding learning,mainly because (1) metapath is a rather strict single path node-noderelationship descriptor, which is unable to accommodate variance inrelationships, and (2) only a small portion of paths can match the metapath,resulting in sparse context information for embedding learning. In this paper,we advocate a new metagraph concept to capture richer structural contexts andsemantics between distant nodes. A metagraph contains multiple paths betweennodes, each describing one type of relationships, so the augmentation ofmultiple metapaths provides an effective way to capture rich contexts andsemantic relations between nodes. This greatly boosts the ability ofmetapath-based embedding techniques in handling very sparse HINs. We propose anew embedding learning algorithm, namely MetaGraph2Vec, which uses metagraph toguide the generation of random walks and to learn latent embeddings ofmulti-typed HIN nodes. Experimental results show that MetaGraph2Vec is able tooutperform the state-of-the-art baselines in various heterogeneous networkmining tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and similaritysearch.

SINE: Scalable Incomplete Network Embedding

  Attributed network embedding aims to learn low-dimensional vectorrepresentations for nodes in a network, where each node contains richattributes/features describing node content. Because network topology structureand node attributes often exhibit high correlation, incorporating nodeattribute proximity into network embedding is beneficial for learning goodvector representations. In reality, large-scale networks often haveincomplete/missing node content or linkages, yet existing attributed networkembedding algorithms all operate under the assumption that networks arecomplete. Thus, their performance is vulnerable to missing data and suffersfrom poor scalability.  In this paper, we propose a Scalable Incomplete Network Embedding (SINE)algorithm for learning node representations from incomplete graphs. SINEformulates a probabilistic learning framework that separately models pairs ofnode-context and node-attribute relationships. Different from existingattributed network embedding algorithms, SINE provides greater flexibility tomake the best of useful information and mitigate negative effects of missinginformation on representation learning. A stochastic gradient descent basedonline algorithm is derived to learn node representations, allowing SINE toscale up to large-scale networks with high learning efficiency. We evaluate theeffectiveness and efficiency of SINE through extensive experiments onreal-world networks. Experimental results confirm that SINE outperformsstate-of-the-art baselines in various tasks, including node classification,node clustering, and link prediction, under settings with missing links andnode attributes. SINE is also shown to be scalable and efficient on large-scalenetworks with millions of nodes/edges and high-dimensional node features.

Measuring Road Network Topology Vulnerability by Ricci Curvature

  Describing the basic properties of road network systems, such as theirrobustness, vulnerability, and reliability, has been a very important researchtopic in the field of urban transportation. Current research mainly usesseveral statistical indicators of complex networks to analyze the road networksystems. However, these methods are essentially node-based. These node-basedmethods are more concerned with the number of connections between nodes, andlack of consideration for interactions. So, this leads to the well-known nodeparadox problem, and their ability of characterizing the local and intrinsicproperties of a network is weak. From the perspective of network intrinsicgeometry, this paper proposes a method for measuring road network vulnerabilityusing a discrete Ricci curvature, which can identify the key sections of a roadnetwork and indicate its fragile elements. The results show that our methodperforms better than complex network statistics on measuring the vulnerabilityof a road network. Additionally, it can characterize the evolution of the roadnetwork vulnerability among different periods of time in the same city throughour method. Finally, we compare our method with the previous method ofcentrality and show the different between them. This article provides a newperspective on a geometry to analyze the vulnerability of a road network anddescribes the inherent nature of the vulnerability of a road system from a newperspective. It also contributes to enriching the analytical methods of complexroad networks.

Attributed Network Embedding via Subspace Discovery

  Network embedding aims to learn a latent, low-dimensional vectorrepresentations of network nodes, effective in supporting various networkanalytic tasks. While prior arts on network embedding focus primarily onpreserving network topology structure to learn node representations, recentlyproposed attributed network embedding algorithms attempt to integrate rich nodecontent information with network topological structure for enhancing thequality of network embedding. In reality, networks often have sparse content,incomplete node attributes, as well as the discrepancy between node attributefeature space and network structure space, which severely deteriorates theperformance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a unified frameworkfor attributed network embedding-attri2vec-that learns node embeddings bydiscovering a latent node attribute subspace via a network structure guidedtransformation performed on the original attribute space. The resultant latentsubspace can respect network structure in a more consistent way towardslearning high-quality node representations. We formulate an optimizationproblem which is solved by an efficient stochastic gradient descent algorithm,with linear time complexity to the number of nodes. We investigate a series oflinear and non-linear transformations performed on node attributes andempirically validate their effectiveness on various types of networks. Anotheradvantage of attri2vec is its ability to solve out-of-sample problems, whereembeddings of new coming nodes can be inferred from their node attributesthrough the learned mapping function. Experiments on various types of networksconfirm that attri2vec is superior to state-of-the-art baselines for nodeclassification, node clustering, as well as out-of-sample link predictiontasks.
