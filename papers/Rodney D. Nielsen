#SarcasmDetection is soooo general! Towards a Domain-Independent  Approach for Detecting Sarcasm

  Automatic sarcasm detection methods have traditionally been designed formaximum performance on a specific domain. This poses challenges for thosewishing to transfer those approaches to other existing or novel domains, whichmay be typified by very different language characteristics. We develop ageneral set of features and evaluate it under different training scenariosutilizing in-domain and/or out-of-domain training data. The best-performingscenario, training on both while employing a domain adaptation step, achievesan F1 of 0.780, which is well above baseline F1-measures of 0.515 and 0.345. Wealso show that the approach outperforms the best results from prior work on thesame target domain.

AI Meets Austen: Towards Human-Robot Discussions of Literary Metaphor

  Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing formal education, fueled byinnovations in learning assessment, content generation, and instructionaldelivery. Informal, lifelong learning settings have been the subject of lessattention. We provide a proof-of-concept for an embodied book discussioncompanion, designed to stimulate conversations with readers about particularlycreative metaphors in fiction literature. We collect ratings from 26participants, each of whom discuss Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" with therobot across one or more sessions, and find that participants rate theirinteractions highly. This suggests that companion robots could be aninteresting entryway for the promotion of lifelong learning and cognitiveexercise in future applications.

Simulating chemistry efficiently on fault-tolerant quantum computers

  Quantum computers can in principle simulate quantum physics exponentiallyfaster than their classical counterparts, but some technical hurdles remain.Here we consider methods to make proposed chemical simulation algorithmscomputationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers in the circuit model.Fault tolerance constrains the choice of available gates, so that arbitrarygates required for a simulation algorithm must be constructed from sequences offundamental operations. We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gateswhich perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventionalSolovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, \emph{Quantum Inf.Comput.}, \textbf{6}:81, 2006]. For a given approximation error $\epsilon$,arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly and using alimited set of gates in time which is $O(\log \epsilon)$ or $O(\log \log\epsilon)$; with sufficient parallel preparation of ancillas, constant averagedepth is possible using a method we call programmable ancilla rotations.Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- andsecond-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gatesand other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constanttime. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation forLithium hydride.

Automatic Measurement of Physical Mobility in Get-Up-and-Go Test Using  Kinect Sensor

  Get-Up-and-Go Test is commonly used for assessing the physical mobility ofthe elderly by physicians. This paper presents a method for automatic analysisand classification of human gait in the Get-Up-and-Go Test using a MicrosoftKinect sensor. Two types of features are automatically extracted from the humanskeleton data provided by the Kinect sensor. The first type of feature isrelated to the human gait (e.g., number of steps, step duration, and turningduration); whereas the other one describes the anatomical configuration (e.g.,knee angles, leg angle, and distance between elbows). These featurescharacterize the degree of human physical mobility. State-of-the-art machinelearning algorithms (i.e. Bag of Words and Support Vector Machines) are used toclassify the severity of gaits in 12 subjects with ages ranging between 65 and90 enrolled in a pilot study. Our experimental results show that these featurescan discriminate between patients who have a high risk for falling and patientswith a lower fall risk.

CANDELS: The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy  Survey - The Hubble Space Telescope Observations, Imaging Data Products and  Mosaics

  This paper describes the Hubble Space Telescope imaging data products anddata reduction procedures for the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep ExtragalacticLegacy Survey (CANDELS). This survey is designed to document the evolution ofgalaxies and black holes at $z\sim1.5-8$, and to study Type Ia SNe beyond$z>1.5$. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each withextensive multiwavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist ofimaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 / infrared channel (WFC3/IR) andUVIS channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). TheCANDELS/Deep survey covers \sim125 square arcminutes within GOODS-N andGOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving atotal of \sim800 square arcminutes across GOODS and three additional fields(EGS, COSMOS, and UDS). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey asmotivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of thedata reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reductionmethods utilize the most up to date calibration files and image combinationprocedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range ofinstrumental effects, including CTE degradation for ACS, removal of electronicbias-striping present in ACS data after SM4, and persistence effects and otherartifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochsand eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitatephotometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A moredetailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the surveyare presented in a companion paper.
