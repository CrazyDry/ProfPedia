#SarcasmDetection is soooo general! Towards a Domain-Independent
  Approach for Detecting Sarcasm

  Automatic sarcasm detection methods have traditionally been designed for
maximum performance on a specific domain. This poses challenges for those
wishing to transfer those approaches to other existing or novel domains, which
may be typified by very different language characteristics. We develop a
general set of features and evaluate it under different training scenarios
utilizing in-domain and/or out-of-domain training data. The best-performing
scenario, training on both while employing a domain adaptation step, achieves
an F1 of 0.780, which is well above baseline F1-measures of 0.515 and 0.345. We
also show that the approach outperforms the best results from prior work on the
same target domain.


AI Meets Austen: Towards Human-Robot Discussions of Literary Metaphor

  Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing formal education, fueled by
innovations in learning assessment, content generation, and instructional
delivery. Informal, lifelong learning settings have been the subject of less
attention. We provide a proof-of-concept for an embodied book discussion
companion, designed to stimulate conversations with readers about particularly
creative metaphors in fiction literature. We collect ratings from 26
participants, each of whom discuss Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" with the
robot across one or more sessions, and find that participants rate their
interactions highly. This suggests that companion robots could be an
interesting entryway for the promotion of lifelong learning and cognitive
exercise in future applications.


Simulating chemistry efficiently on fault-tolerant quantum computers

  Quantum computers can in principle simulate quantum physics exponentially
faster than their classical counterparts, but some technical hurdles remain.
Here we consider methods to make proposed chemical simulation algorithms
computationally fast on fault-tolerant quantum computers in the circuit model.
Fault tolerance constrains the choice of available gates, so that arbitrary
gates required for a simulation algorithm must be constructed from sequences of
fundamental operations. We examine techniques for constructing arbitrary gates
which perform substantially faster than circuits based on the conventional
Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [C.M. Dawson and M.A. Nielsen, \emph{Quantum Inf.
Comput.}, \textbf{6}:81, 2006]. For a given approximation error $\epsilon$,
arbitrary single-qubit gates can be produced fault-tolerantly and using a
limited set of gates in time which is $O(\log \epsilon)$ or $O(\log \log
\epsilon)$; with sufficient parallel preparation of ancillas, constant average
depth is possible using a method we call programmable ancilla rotations.
Moreover, we construct and analyze efficient implementations of first- and
second-quantized simulation algorithms using the fault-tolerant arbitrary gates
and other techniques, such as implementing various subroutines in constant
time. A specific example we analyze is the ground-state energy calculation for
Lithium hydride.


Automatic Measurement of Physical Mobility in Get-Up-and-Go Test Using
  Kinect Sensor

  Get-Up-and-Go Test is commonly used for assessing the physical mobility of
the elderly by physicians. This paper presents a method for automatic analysis
and classification of human gait in the Get-Up-and-Go Test using a Microsoft
Kinect sensor. Two types of features are automatically extracted from the human
skeleton data provided by the Kinect sensor. The first type of feature is
related to the human gait (e.g., number of steps, step duration, and turning
duration); whereas the other one describes the anatomical configuration (e.g.,
knee angles, leg angle, and distance between elbows). These features
characterize the degree of human physical mobility. State-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms (i.e. Bag of Words and Support Vector Machines) are used to
classify the severity of gaits in 12 subjects with ages ranging between 65 and
90 enrolled in a pilot study. Our experimental results show that these features
can discriminate between patients who have a high risk for falling and patients
with a lower fall risk.


CANDELS: The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy
  Survey - The Hubble Space Telescope Observations, Imaging Data Products and
  Mosaics

  This paper describes the Hubble Space Telescope imaging data products and
data reduction procedures for the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic
Legacy Survey (CANDELS). This survey is designed to document the evolution of
galaxies and black holes at $z\sim1.5-8$, and to study Type Ia SNe beyond
$z>1.5$. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with
extensive multiwavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of
imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 / infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and
UVIS channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The
CANDELS/Deep survey covers \sim125 square arcminutes within GOODS-N and
GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a
total of \sim800 square arcminutes across GOODS and three additional fields
(EGS, COSMOS, and UDS). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as
motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the
data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction
methods utilize the most up to date calibration files and image combination
procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of
instrumental effects, including CTE degradation for ACS, removal of electronic
bias-striping present in ACS data after SM4, and persistence effects and other
artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs
and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate
photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more
detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey
are presented in a companion paper.
