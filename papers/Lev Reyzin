Contextual Bandit Algorithms with Supervised Learning Guarantees

  We address the problem of learning in an online, bandit setting where thelearner must repeatedly select among $K$ actions, but only receives partialfeedback based on its choices. We establish two new facts: First, using a newalgorithm called Exp4.P, we show that it is possible to compete with the bestin a set of $N$ experts with probability $1-\delta$ while incurring regret atmost $O(\sqrt{KT\ln(N/\delta)})$ over $T$ time steps. The new algorithm istested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a newalgorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies ofVC-dimension $d$ while incurring regret at most $O(\sqrt{T(d\ln(T) + \ln(1/\delta))})$ with probability $1-\delta$. These guarantees improve on thoseof all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment,and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for thecontextual bandit setting.

On the Resilience of Bipartite Networks

  Motivated by problems modeling the spread of infections in networks, in thispaper we explore which bipartite graphs are most resilient to widespreadinfections under various parameter settings. Namely, we study bipartitenetworks with a requirement of a minimum degree $d$ on one side under anindependent infection, independent transmission model. We completelycharacterize the optimal graphs in the case $d=1$, which already producesnon-trivial behavior, and we give extremal results for the more general cases.We show that in the case $d=2$, surprisingly, the optimally resilient set ofgraphs includes a graph that is not one of the two "extremes" found in the case$d=1$.  Then, we briefly examine the case where we force a connectivity requirementinstead of a one-sided degree requirement and again, we find that the set ofthe most resilient graphs contains more than the two "extremes." We also showthat determining the subgraph of an arbitrary bipartite graph most resilient toinfection is NP-hard for any one-sided minimal degree $d \ge 1$.

Network Construction with Ordered Constraints

  In this paper, we study the problem of constructing a network by observingordered connectivity constraints, which we define herein. These orderedconstraints are made to capture realistic properties of real-world problemsthat are not reflected in previous, more general models. We give hardness ofapproximation results and nearly-matching upper bounds for the offline problem,and we study the online problem in both general graphs and restrictedsub-classes. In the online problem, for general graphs, we give exponentiallybetter upper bounds than exist for algorithms for general connectivityproblems. For the restricted classes of stars and paths we are able to findalgorithms with optimal competitive ratios, the latter of which involveanalysis using a potential function defined over pq-trees.

Crowdsourced PAC Learning under Classification Noise

  In this paper, we analyze PAC learnability from labels produced bycrowdsourcing. In our setting, unlabeled examples are drawn from a distributionand labels are crowdsourced from workers who operate under classificationnoise, each with their own noise parameter. We develop an end-to-endcrowdsourced PAC learning algorithm that takes unlabeled data points as inputand outputs a trained classifier. Our three-step algorithm incorporatesmajority voting, pure-exploration bandits, and noisy-PAC learning. We proveseveral guarantees on the number of tasks labeled by workers for PAC learningin this setting and show that our algorithm improves upon the baseline byreducing the total number of tasks given to workers. We demonstrate therobustness of our algorithm by exploring its application to additionalrealistic crowdsourcing settings.

On Coloring Resilient Graphs

  We introduce a new notion of resilience for constraint satisfaction problems,with the goal of more precisely determining the boundary between NP-hardnessand the existence of efficient algorithms for resilient instances. Inparticular, we study $r$-resiliently $k$-colorable graphs, which are those$k$-colorable graphs that remain $k$-colorable even after the addition of any$r$ new edges. We prove lower bounds on the NP-hardness of coloring resilientlycolorable graphs, and provide an algorithm that colors sufficiently resilientgraphs. We also analyze the corresponding notion of resilience for $k$-SAT.This notion of resilience suggests an array of open questions for graphcoloring and other combinatorial problems.

Data Stability in Clustering: A Closer Look

  We consider the model introduced by Bilu and Linial (2010), who studyproblems for which the optimal clustering does not change when distances areperturbed. They show that even when a problem is NP-hard, it is sometimespossible to obtain efficient algorithms for instances resilient to certainmultiplicative perturbations, e.g. on the order of $O(\sqrt{n})$ for max-cutclustering. Awasthi et al. (2010) consider center-based objectives, and Balcanand Liang (2011) analyze the $k$-median and min-sum objectives, givingefficient algorithms for instances resilient to certain constant multiplicativeperturbations.  Here, we are motivated by the question of to what extent these assumptionscan be relaxed while allowing for efficient algorithms. We show there is littleroom to improve these results by giving NP-hardness lower bounds for both the$k$-median and min-sum objectives. On the other hand, we show that constantmultiplicative resilience parameters can be so strong as to make the clusteringproblem trivial, leaving only a narrow range of resilience parameters for whichclustering is interesting. We also consider a model of additive perturbationsand give a correspondence between additive and multiplicative notions ofstability. Our results provide a close examination of the consequences ofassuming stability in data.

Efficient Optimal Learning for Contextual Bandits

  We address the problem of learning in an online setting where the learnerrepeatedly observes features, selects among a set of actions, and receivesreward for the action taken. We provide the first efficient algorithm with anoptimal regret. Our algorithm uses a cost sensitive classification learner asan oracle and has a running time $\mathrm{polylog}(N)$, where $N$ is the numberof classification rules among which the oracle might choose. This isexponentially faster than all previous algorithms that achieve optimal regretin this setting. Our formulation also enables us to create an algorithm withregret that is additive rather than multiplicative in feedback delay as in allprevious work.

Anti-Coordination Games and Stable Graph Colorings

  Motivated by understanding non-strict and strict pure strategy equilibria innetwork anti-coordination games, we define notions of stable and, respectively,strictly stable colorings in graphs. We characterize the cases when suchcolorings exist and when the decision problem is NP-hard. These correspond tofinding pure strategy equilibria in the anti-coordination games, whose price ofanarchy we also analyze. We further consider the directed case, ageneralization that captures both coordination and anti-coordination. We provethe decision problem for non-strict equilibria in directed graphs is NP-hard.Our notions also have multiple connections to other combinatorial questions,and our results resolve some open problems in these areas, most notably thecomplexity of the strictly unfriendly partition problem.

On the Computational Complexity of MapReduce

  In this paper we study MapReduce computations from a complexity-theoreticperspective. First, we formulate a uniform version of the MRC model of Karloffet al. (2010). We then show that the class of regular languages, and moreoverall of sublogarithmic space, lies in constant round MRC. This result alsoapplies to the MPC model of Andoni et al. (2014). In addition, we prove that,conditioned on a variant of the Exponential Time Hypothesis, there are stricthierarchies within MRC so that increasing the number of rounds or the amount oftime per processor increases the power of MRC. To the best of our knowledge weare the first to approach the MapReduce model with complexity-theoretictechniques, and our work lays the foundation for further analysis relatingMapReduce to established complexity classes.

Network installation and recovery: approximation lower bounds and faster  exact formulations

  We study the Neighbor Aided Network Installation Problem (NANIP) introducedpreviously which asks for a minimal cost ordering of the vertices of a graph,where the cost of visiting a node is a function of the number of neighbors thathave already been visited. This problem has applications in resource managementand disaster recovery. In this paper we analyze the computational hardness ofNANIP. In particular we show that this problem is NP-hard even when restrictedto convex decreasing cost functions, give a linear approximation lower boundfor the greedy algorithm, and prove a general sub-constant approximation lowerbound. Then we give a new integer programming formulation of NANIP andempirically observe its speedup over the original integer program.

A Simple Spectral Algorithm for Recovering Planted Partitions

  In this paper, we consider the planted partition model, in which $n = ks$vertices of a random graph are partitioned into $k$ "clusters," each of size$s$. Edges between vertices in the same cluster and different clusters areincluded with constant probability $p$ and $q$, respectively (where $0 \le q <p \le 1$). We give an efficient algorithm that, with high probability, recoversthe clusters as long as the cluster sizes are are least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$.Informally, our algorithm constructs the projection operator onto the dominant$k$-dimensional eigenspace of the graph's adjacency matrix and uses it torecover one cluster at a time. To our knowledge, our algorithm is the firstpurely spectral algorithm which runs in polynomial time and works even when $s= \Theta(\sqrt n)$, though there have been several non-spectral algorithmswhich accomplish this. Our algorithm is also among the simplest of thesespectral algorithms, and its proof of correctness illustrates the usefulness ofthe Cauchy integral formula in this domain.

Sampling Without Compromising Accuracy in Adaptive Data Analysis

  In this work, we study how to use sampling to speed up mechanisms foranswering adaptive queries into datasets without reducing the accuracy of thosemechanisms. In particular, we describe a mechanism that provides a polynomialspeed-up per query over previous mechanisms, without needing to increase thetotal amount of data required to maintain the same generalization error asbefore. We prove that this speed-up holds for arbitrary statistical queries. Wealso provide an even faster method for achieving statistically-meaningfulresponses wherein the mechanism is only allowed to see a constant number ofsamples from the data per query. Finally, we show that our general resultsyield a simple, fast, and unified approach for adaptively optimizing convex andstrongly convex functions over a dataset.

Statistical Algorithms and a Lower Bound for Detecting Planted Clique

  We introduce a framework for proving lower bounds on computational problemsover distributions against algorithms that can be implemented using access to astatistical query oracle. For such algorithms, access to the input distributionis limited to obtaining an estimate of the expectation of any given function ona sample drawn randomly from the input distribution, rather than directlyaccessing samples. Most natural algorithms of interest in theory and inpractice, e.g., moments-based methods, local search, standard iterative methodsfor convex optimization, MCMC and simulated annealing can be implemented inthis framework. Our framework is based on, and generalizes, the statisticalquery model in learning theory (Kearns, 1998).  Our main application is a nearly optimal lower bound on the complexity of anystatistical query algorithm for detecting planted bipartite cliquedistributions (or planted dense subgraph distributions) when the planted cliquehas size $O(n^{1/2-\delta})$ for any constant $\delta > 0$. The assumedhardness of variants of these problems has been used to prove hardness ofseveral other problems and as a guarantee for security in cryptographicapplications. Our lower bounds provide concrete evidence of hardness, thussupporting these assumptions.
