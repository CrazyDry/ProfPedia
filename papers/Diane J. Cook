A Survey of Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation

  Deep learning has produced state-of-the-art results for a variety of tasks.
While such approaches for supervised learning have performed well, they assume
that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution, which may
not always be the case. As a complement to this challenge, unsupervised domain
adaptation can handle situations where a network is trained on labeled data
from a source domain and unlabeled data from a related but different target
domain with the goal of performing well at test-time on the target domain. Many
unsupervised deep domain adaptation approaches have thus been developed. This
survey will compare these approaches by examining alternative methods, the
unique and common elements, results, and theoretical insights. We follow this
with a look at application areas and open research directions.
