Interaction effects on a Majorana zero mode leaking into a quantum dot

  We have recently shown [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 89}, 165314 (2014)] that anon--interacting quantum dot coupled to a one--dimensional topologicalsuperconductor and to normal leads can sustain a Majorana mode even when thedot is expected to be empty, \emph{i.e.}, when the dot energy level is farabove the Fermi level of he leads. This is due to the Majorana bound state ofthe wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work byinvestigating the low--temperature quantum transport through an {\itinteracting} quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side--coupledto a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero--modeleaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using arecursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime usingnumerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay betweenthe Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire couplingstrengths, gate voltages and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a "0.5"conductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between theleaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for awide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressedby Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, issuppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero--biasconductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well--knownuniversality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose thatthe universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of$0.5\,e^2/h$ is evidence of the presence of Majorana--Kondo physics. Theseresults confirm that this "0.5" Majorana signature in the dot remains even inthe presence of the Kondo effect.

Hard X-ray multi-projection imaging for single-shot approaches

  Obtaining 3D information from a single X-ray exposure at high-brilliancesources, such as X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) [1] or diffraction-limitedstorage rings [2], allows the study of fast dynamical processes in their nativeenvironment. However, current X-ray 3D methodologies are either not compatiblewith single-shot approaches because they rely on multiple exposures, such asconfocal microscopy [3, 4] and tomography [5, 6]; or they record a singleprojection per pulse [7] and are therefore restricted to approximatelytwo-dimensional objects [8]. Here we propose and verify experimentally a novelimaging approach named X-ray multi-projection imaging (XMPI), whichsimultaneously acquires several projections without rotating the sample atsignificant tomographic angles. When implemented at high-brilliance sources itcan provide volumetric information using a single pulse. Moreover, XMPI at MHzrepetition XFELs could allow a way to record 3D movies of deterministic orstochastic natural processes in the micrometer to nanometer resolution range,and at time scales from microseconds down to femtoseconds.

Reconstructing Extreme Space Weather from Planet Hosting Stars

  The field of exoplanetary science is making rapid progress both instatistical studies of exoplanet properties as well as in individualcharacterization. As space missions provide an emerging picture of formationand evolution of exoplanetary systems, the search for habitable worlds becomesone of the fundamental issues to address. To tackle such a complex challenge,we need to specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development andsustainment of life as we know it. This requires the understanding of global(astrospheric) and local (atmospheric, surface and internal) environments ofexoplanets in the framework of the physical processes of the interactionbetween evolving planet-hosting stars along with exoplanetary evolution overgeological timescales, and the resulting impact on climate and habitability ofexoplanets. Feedbacks between astrophysical, physico-chemical atmospheric andgeological processes can only be understood through interdisciplinary studieswith the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary,Earth sciences, astrobiology, and the origin of life communities. Theassessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability ofterrestrial (exo)planets and potential exomoons around them may significantlymodify the extent and the location of the habitable zone and provide newdirections for searching for signatures of life. Thus, characterization ofstellar ionizing outputs becomes an important task for further understandingthe extent of habitability in the universe. The goal of this white paper is toidentify and describe promising key research goals to aid the theoreticalcharacterization and observational detection of ionizing radiation fromquiescent and flaring upper atmospheres of planet hosts as well as propertiesof stellar coronal mass ejections and stellar energetic particle events.
