Interaction effects on a Majorana zero mode leaking into a quantum dot

  We have recently shown [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 89}, 165314 (2014)] that a
non--interacting quantum dot coupled to a one--dimensional topological
superconductor and to normal leads can sustain a Majorana mode even when the
dot is expected to be empty, \emph{i.e.}, when the dot energy level is far
above the Fermi level of he leads. This is due to the Majorana bound state of
the wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work by
investigating the low--temperature quantum transport through an {\it
interacting} quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side--coupled
to a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero--mode
leaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using a
recursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime using
numerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay between
the Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire coupling
strengths, gate voltages and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a "0.5"
conductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between the
leaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for a
wide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressed
by Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, is
suppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero--bias
conductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well--known
universality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose that
the universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of
$0.5\,e^2/h$ is evidence of the presence of Majorana--Kondo physics. These
results confirm that this "0.5" Majorana signature in the dot remains even in
the presence of the Kondo effect.


Hard X-ray multi-projection imaging for single-shot approaches

  Obtaining 3D information from a single X-ray exposure at high-brilliance
sources, such as X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) [1] or diffraction-limited
storage rings [2], allows the study of fast dynamical processes in their native
environment. However, current X-ray 3D methodologies are either not compatible
with single-shot approaches because they rely on multiple exposures, such as
confocal microscopy [3, 4] and tomography [5, 6]; or they record a single
projection per pulse [7] and are therefore restricted to approximately
two-dimensional objects [8]. Here we propose and verify experimentally a novel
imaging approach named X-ray multi-projection imaging (XMPI), which
simultaneously acquires several projections without rotating the sample at
significant tomographic angles. When implemented at high-brilliance sources it
can provide volumetric information using a single pulse. Moreover, XMPI at MHz
repetition XFELs could allow a way to record 3D movies of deterministic or
stochastic natural processes in the micrometer to nanometer resolution range,
and at time scales from microseconds down to femtoseconds.


Reconstructing Extreme Space Weather from Planet Hosting Stars

  The field of exoplanetary science is making rapid progress both in
statistical studies of exoplanet properties as well as in individual
characterization. As space missions provide an emerging picture of formation
and evolution of exoplanetary systems, the search for habitable worlds becomes
one of the fundamental issues to address. To tackle such a complex challenge,
we need to specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development and
sustainment of life as we know it. This requires the understanding of global
(astrospheric) and local (atmospheric, surface and internal) environments of
exoplanets in the framework of the physical processes of the interaction
between evolving planet-hosting stars along with exoplanetary evolution over
geological timescales, and the resulting impact on climate and habitability of
exoplanets. Feedbacks between astrophysical, physico-chemical atmospheric and
geological processes can only be understood through interdisciplinary studies
with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary,
Earth sciences, astrobiology, and the origin of life communities. The
assessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of
terrestrial (exo)planets and potential exomoons around them may significantly
modify the extent and the location of the habitable zone and provide new
directions for searching for signatures of life. Thus, characterization of
stellar ionizing outputs becomes an important task for further understanding
the extent of habitability in the universe. The goal of this white paper is to
identify and describe promising key research goals to aid the theoretical
characterization and observational detection of ionizing radiation from
quiescent and flaring upper atmospheres of planet hosts as well as properties
of stellar coronal mass ejections and stellar energetic particle events.
