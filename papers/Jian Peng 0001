Adsorption and diffusion of H2O molecule on the Be(0001) surface: A  density-functional theory study

  Using first-principles calculations, we systematically study the adsorptionbehavior of a single molecular H$_{2}$O on the Be(0001) surface. We find thatthe favored molecular adsorption site is the top site with an adsorption energyof about 0.3 eV, together with the detailed electronic structure analysis,suggesting a weak binding strength of the H$_{2}$O/Be(0001) surface. Theadsorption interaction is mainly contributed by the overlapping between the $s$and $p_{z}$ states of the top-layer Be atom and the molecular orbitals 1$b_{1}$and 3$a_{1}$ of H$_{2}$O. The activation energy for H$_{2}$O diffusion on thesurface is about 0.3 eV. Meanwhile, our study indicates that no dissociationstate exists for the H$_{2}$O/Be(0001) surface.

Adsorption and dissociation of water on Zr(0001) with density-functional  theory studies

  The adsorption and dissociation of isolated water molecule on Zr(0001)surface are theoretically investigated for the first time by usingdensity-functional theory calculations. Two kinds of adsorption configurationswith almost the same adsorption energy are identified as the locally stablestates, i.e., the flat and upright configurations respectively. It is shownthat the flat adsorption states on the top site are dominated by the1$b_{1}$-$d$ band coupling, insensitive to the azimuthal orientation. Thediffusion between adjacent top sites reveals that the water molecule is verymobile on the surface. For the upright configuration, we find that besides thecontribution of the molecular orbitals 1$b_{1}$ and 3$a_{1}$, thesurface$\rightarrow$water charge transfer occurring across the Fermi level alsoplays an important role. The dissociation of H$_{2}$O is found to be veryfacile, especially for the upright configuration, in good accordance with theattainable experimental results. The present results afford to provide aguiding line for deeply understanding the water-induced surface corrosion ofzirconium.

Detection of a superconducting phase in a two-atom layer of hexagonal Ga  film grown on semiconducting GaN(0001)

  The recent observation of superconducting state at atomic scale has motivatedthe pursuit of exotic condensed phases in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here wereport on a superconducting phase in two-monolayer crystalline Ga filmsepitaxially grown on wide band-gap semiconductor GaN(0001). This phase exhibitsa hexagonal structure and only 0.552 nm in thickness, nevertheless, bringsabout a superconducting transition temperature Tc as high as 5.4 K, confirmedby in situ scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and ex situ electricalmagneto-transport and magnetization measurements. The anisotropy of criticalmagnetic field and Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition are observed,typical for the 2D superconductivity. Our results demonstrate a novel platformfor exploring atomic-scale 2D superconductor, with great potential forunderstanding of the interface superconductivity.
