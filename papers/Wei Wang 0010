Simplification of protein representation from the contact potentials  between residues

  Based on the concept of energy landscape a picture of the mismatch betweenthe reduced interaction matrix of residues and the matrix of statisticalcontact potentials is presented. For the Miyazawa and Jernigan (MJ) matrix,rational groupings of 20 kinds of residues with minimal mismatches under theconsideration of local minima and statistics on correlation between theresidues are studied. A hierarchical tree of groupings relating to differentnumbers of groups $N$ is obtained, and a plateau around $N=8\sim 10$ is found,which may represent the basic degree of freedom of the sequence complexity ofproteins.
