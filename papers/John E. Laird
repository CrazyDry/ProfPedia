Relational Reinforcement Learning in Infinite Mario

  Relational representations in reinforcement learning allow for the use of
structural information like the presence of objects and relationships between
them in the description of value functions. Through this paper, we show that
such representations allow for the inclusion of background knowledge that
qualitatively describes a state and can be used to design agents that
demonstrate learning behavior in domains with large state and actions spaces
such as computer games.


Hunting for the progenitor of SN 1006: High resolution spectroscopic
  search with the FLAMES instrument

  Type Ia supernovae play a significant role in the evolution of the Universe
and have a wide range of applications. It is widely believed that these events
are the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs close to the
Chandrasekhar mass (1.38 M\odot). However, CO white dwarfs are born with masses
much below the Chandrasekhar limit and thus require mass accretion to become
Type Ia supernovae. There are two main scenarios for accretion. First, the
merger of two white dwarfs and, second, a stable mass accretion from a
companion star. According to predictions, this companion star (also referred to
as donor star) survives the explosion and thus should be visible in the center
of Type Ia remnants. In this paper we scrutinize the central stars (79 in
total) of the SN 1006 remnant to search for the surviving donor star as
predicted by this scenario. We find no star consistent with the traditional
accretion scenario in SN1006.


MagAO Imaging of Long-period Objects (MILO). II. A Puzzling White Dwarf
  around the Sun-like Star HD 11112

  HD 11112 is an old, Sun-like star that has a long-term radial velocity (RV)
trend indicative of a massive companion on a wide orbit. Here we present direct
images of the source responsible for the trend using the Magellan Adaptive
Optics system. We detect the object (HD 11112B) at a separation of 2\fasec 2
(100 AU) at multiple wavelengths spanning 0.6-4 \microns ~and show that it is
most likely a gravitationally-bound cool white dwarf. Modeling its spectral
energy distribution (SED) suggests that its mass is 0.9-1.1 \msun, which
corresponds to very high-eccentricity, near edge-on orbits from Markov chain
Monte Carlo analysis of the RV and imaging data together. The total age of the
white dwarf is $>2\sigma$ discrepant with that of the primary star under most
assumptions. The problem can be resolved if the white dwarf progenitor was
initially a double white dwarf binary that then merged into the observed
high-mass white dwarf. HD 11112B is a unique and intriguing benchmark object
that can be used to calibrate atmospheric and evolutionary models of cool white
dwarfs and should thus continue to be monitored by RV and direct imaging over
the coming years.


Mapping H-band Scattered Light Emission in the Mysterious SR21
  Transitional Disk

  We present the first near infrared (NIR) spatially resolved images of the
circumstellar transitional disk around SR21. These images were obtained with
the Subaru HiCIAO camera, adaptive optics and the polarized differential
imaging (PDI) technique. We resolve the disk in scattered light at H-band for
stellocentric 0.1"<r<0.6" (12<r<75AU). We compare our results with previously
published spatially-resolved 880 micron continuum Submillimeter Array (SMA)
images that show an inner r<36AU cavity in SR21. Radiative transfer models
reveal that the large disk depletion factor invoked to explain SR21's sub-mm
cavity cannot be "universal" for all grain sizes. Even significantly more
moderate depletions (delta=0.1, 0.01 relative to an undepleted disk) than those
that reproduce the sub-mm cavity (delta~10^-6) are inconsistent with our H-band
images when they are assumed to carry over to small grains, suggesting that
surface grains scattering in the NIR either survive or are generated by
whatever mechanism is clearing the disk midplane. In fact, the radial polarized
intensity profile of our H-band observations is smooth and steeply
inwardly-increasing (r^-3), with no evidence of a break at the 36AU sub-mm
cavity wall. We hypothesize that this profile is dominated by an optically thin
disk envelope or atmosphere component. We also discuss the compatibility of our
data with the previously postulated existence of a sub-stellar companion to
SR21 at r~10-20AU, and find that we can neither exclude nor verify this
scenario. This study demonstrates the power of multiwavelength imaging of
transitional disks to inform modeling efforts, including the debate over
precisely what physical mechanism is responsible for clearing these disks of
their large midplane grains.


The Gray Needle: Large Grains in the HD 15115 Debris Disk from
  LBT/PISCES/Ks and LBTI/LMIRcam/L' Adaptive Optics Imaging

  We present diffraction-limited \ks band and \lprime adaptive optics images of
the edge-on debris disk around the nearby F2 star HD 15115, obtained with a
single 8.4 m primary mirror at the Large Binocular Telescope. At \ks band the
disk is detected at signal-to-noise per resolution element (SNRE) \about 3-8
from \about 1-2\fasec 5 (45-113 AU) on the western side, and from \about
1.2-2\fasec 1 (63-90 AU) on the east. At \lprime the disk is detected at SNRE
\about 2.5 from \about 1-1\fasec 45 (45-90 AU) on both sides, implying more
symmetric disk structure at 3.8 \microns . At both wavelengths the disk has a
bow-like shape and is offset from the star to the north by a few AU. A surface
brightness asymmetry exists between the two sides of the disk at \ks band, but
not at \lprime . The surface brightness at \ks band declines inside 1\asec
(\about 45 AU), which may be indicative of a gap in the disk near 1\asec. The
\ks - \lprime disk color, after removal of the stellar color, is mostly grey
for both sides of the disk. This suggests that scattered light is coming from
large dust grains, with 3-10 \microns -sized grains on the east side and 1-10
\microns dust grains on the west. This may suggest that the west side is
composed of smaller dust grains than the east side, which would support the
interpretation that the disk is being dynamically affected by interactions with
the local interstellar medium.


SEEDS Adaptive Optics Imaging of the Asymmetric Transition Disk Oph IRS
  48 in Scattered Light

  We present the first resolved near infrared imagery of the transition disk
Oph IRS 48 (WLY 2-48), which was recently observed with ALMA to have a strongly
asymmetric sub-millimeter flux distribution. H-band polarized intensity images
show a $\sim$60AU radius scattered light cavity with two pronounced arcs of
emission, one from Northeast to Southeast and one smaller, fainter and more
distant arc in the Northwest. K-band scattered light imagery reveals a similar
morphology, but with a clear third arc along the Southwestern rim of the disk
cavity. This arc meets the Northwestern arc at nearly a right angle, revealing
the presence of a spiral arm or local surface brightness deficit in the disk,
and explaining the East-West brightness asymmetry in the H-band data. We also
present 0.8-5.4$\mu$m IRTF SpeX spectra of this object, which allow us to
constrain the spectral class to A0$\pm$1 and measure a low mass accretion rate
of 10$^{-8.5}$M$_{\odot}$/yr, both consistent with previous estimates. We
investigate a variety of reddening laws in order to fit the mutliwavelength SED
of Oph IRS 48 and find a best fit consistent with a younger, higher luminosity
star than previous estimates.


Observation of the rare $B^0_s\toμ^+μ^-$ decay from the combined
  analysis of CMS and LHCb data

  A joint measurement is presented of the branching fractions
$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ in proton-proton collisions at the
LHC by the CMS and LHCb experiments. The data samples were collected in 2011 at
a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and in 2012 at 8 TeV. The combined analysis
produces the first observation of the $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, with a
statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best
measurement of its branching fraction so far. Furthermore, evidence for the
$B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay is obtained with a statistical significance of three
standard deviations. The branching fraction measurements are statistically
compatible with SM predictions and impose stringent constraints on several
theories beyond the SM.
