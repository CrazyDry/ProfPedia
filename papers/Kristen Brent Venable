Reasoning about soft constraints and conditional preferences: complexity  results and approximation techniques

  Many real life optimization problems contain both hard and soft constraints,as well as qualitative conditional preferences. However, there is no singleformalism to specify all three kinds of information. We therefore propose aframework, based on both CP-nets and soft constraints, that handles both hardand soft constraints as well as conditional preferences efficiently anduniformly. We study the complexity of testing the consistency of preferencestatements, and show how soft constraints can faithfully approximate thesemantics of conditional preference statements whilst improving thecomputational complexity

Restricted Manipulation in Iterative Voting: Convergence and Condorcet  Efficiency

  In collective decision making, where a voting rule is used to take acollective decision among a group of agents, manipulation by one or more agentsis usually considered negative behavior to be avoided, or at least to be madecomputationally difficult for the agents to perform. However, there arescenarios in which a restricted form of manipulation can instead be beneficial.In this paper we consider the iterative version of several voting rules, whereat each step one agent is allowed to manipulate by modifying his ballotaccording to a set of restricted manipulation moves which are computationallyeasy and require little information to be performed. We prove convergence ofiterative voting rules when restricted manipulation is allowed, and we presentexperiments showing that most iterative voting rules have a higher Condorcetefficiency than their non-iterative version.

Comparing the notions of optimality in CP-nets, strategic games and soft  constraints

  The notion of optimality naturally arises in many areas of appliedmathematics and computer science concerned with decision making. Here weconsider this notion in the context of three formalisms used for differentpurposes in reasoning about multi-agent systems: strategic games, CP-nets, andsoft constraints. To relate the notions of optimality in these formalisms weintroduce a natural qualitative modification of the notion of a strategic game.We show then that the optimal outcomes of a CP-net are exactly the Nashequilibria of such games. This allows us to use the techniques of game theoryto search for optimal outcomes of CP-nets and vice-versa, to use techniquesdeveloped for CP-nets to search for Nash equilibria of the considered games.Then, we relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraintsto that used in a generalization of strategic games, called graphical games. Inparticular we prove that for a natural class of soft constraints that includesweighted constraints every optimal solution is both a Nash equilibrium andPareto efficient joint strategy. For a natural mapping in the other directionwe show that Pareto efficient joint strategies coincide with the optimalsolutions of soft constraints.

Local search for stable marriage problems with ties and incomplete lists

  The stable marriage problem has a wide variety of practical applications,ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students toschools, or more generally to any two-sided market. We consider a usefulvariation of the stable marriage problem, where the men and women express theirpreferences using a preference list with ties over a subset of the members ofthe other sex. Matchings are permitted only with people who appear in thesepreference lists. In this setting, we study the problem of finding a stablematching that marries as many people as possible. Stability is an envy-freenotion: no man and woman who are not married to each other would both prefereach other to their partners or to being single. This problem is NP-hard. Wetackle this problem using local search, exploiting properties of the problem toreduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently.Experimental results show that this approach is able to solve large problems,quickly returning stable matchings of large and often optimal size.
