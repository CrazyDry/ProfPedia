Got the Flu (or Mumps)? Check the Eigenvalue!

  For a given, arbitrary graph, what is the epidemic threshold? That is, under
what conditions will a virus result in an epidemic? We provide the super-model
theorem, which generalizes older results in two important, orthogonal
dimensions. The theorem shows that (a) for a wide range of virus propagation
models (VPM) that include all virus propagation models in standard literature
(say, [8][5]), and (b) for any contact graph, the answer always depends on the
first eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix. We give the proof of the theorem,
arithmetic examples for popular VPMs, like flu (SIS), mumps (SIR), SIRS and
more. We also show the implications of our discovery: easy (although sometimes
counter-intuitive) answers to `what-if' questions; easier design and evaluation
of immunization policies, and significantly faster agent-based simulations.


Distributed Representation of Subgraphs

  Network embeddings have become very popular in learning effective feature
representations of networks. Motivated by the recent successes of embeddings in
natural language processing, researchers have tried to find network embeddings
in order to exploit machine learning algorithms for mining tasks like node
classification and edge prediction. However, most of the work focuses on
finding distributed representations of nodes, which are inherently ill-suited
to tasks such as community detection which are intuitively dependent on
subgraphs.
  Here, we propose sub2vec, an unsupervised scalable algorithm to learn feature
representations of arbitrary subgraphs. We provide means to characterize
similarties between subgraphs and provide theoretical analysis of sub2vec and
demonstrate that it preserves the so-called local proximity. We also highlight
the usability of sub2vec by leveraging it for network mining tasks, like
community detection. We show that sub2vec gets significant gains over
state-of-the-art methods and node-embedding methods. In particular, sub2vec
offers an approach to generate a richer vocabulary of features of subgraphs to
support representation and reasoning.


Forecasting the Flu: Designing Social Network Sensors for Epidemics

  Early detection and modeling of a contagious epidemic can provide important
guidance about quelling the contagion, controlling its spread, or the effective
design of countermeasures. A topic of recent interest has been to design social
network sensors, i.e., identifying a small set of people who can be monitored
to provide insight into the emergence of an epidemic in a larger population. We
formally pose the problem of designing social network sensors for flu epidemics
and identify two different objectives that could be targeted in such sensor
design problems. Using the graph theoretic notion of dominators we develop an
efficient and effective heuristic for forecasting epidemics at lead time. Using
six city-scale datasets generated by extensive microscopic epidemiological
simulations involving millions of individuals, we illustrate the practical
applicability of our methods and show significant benefits (up to twenty-two
days more lead time) compared to other competitors. Most importantly, we
demonstrate the use of surrogates or proxies for policy makers for designing
social network sensors that require from nonintrusive knowledge of people to
more information on the relationship among people. The results show that the
more intrusive information we obtain, the longer lead time to predict the flu
outbreak up to nine days.


Approximation Algorithms for Reducing the Spectral Radius to Control
  Epidemic Spread

  The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network (referred to as
the spectral radius) is an important metric in its own right. Further, for
several models of epidemic spread on networks (e.g., the `flu-like' SIS model),
it has been shown that an epidemic dies out quickly if the spectral radius of
the graph is below a certain threshold that depends on the model parameters.
This motivates a strategy to control epidemic spread by reducing the spectral
radius of the underlying network.
  In this paper, we develop a suite of provable approximation algorithms for
reducing the spectral radius by removing the minimum cost set of edges
(modeling quarantining) or nodes (modeling vaccinations), with different time
and quality tradeoffs. Our main algorithm, \textsc{GreedyWalk}, is based on the
idea of hitting closed walks of a given length, and gives an
$O(\log^2{n})$-approximation, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes; it also
performs much better in practice compared to all prior heuristics proposed for
this problem. We further present a novel sparsification method to improve its
running time.
  In addition, we give a new primal-dual based algorithm with an even better
approximation guarantee ($O(\log n)$), albeit with slower running time. We also
give lower bounds on the worst-case performance of some of the popular
heuristics. Finally we demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms and the
properties of our solutions via extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and
real networks.


Distributed Representations of Signed Networks

  Recent successes in word embedding and document embedding have motivated
researchers to explore similar representations for networks and to use such
representations for tasks such as edge prediction, node label prediction, and
community detection. Such network embedding methods are largely focused on
finding distributed representations for unsigned networks and are unable to
discover embeddings that respect polarities inherent in edges. We propose
SIGNet, a fast scalable embedding method suitable for signed networks. Our
proposed objective function aims to carefully model the social structure
implicit in signed networks by reinforcing the principles of social balance
theory. Our method builds upon the traditional word2vec family of embedding
approaches and adds a new targeted node sampling strategy to maintain
structural balance in higher-order neighborhoods. We demonstrate the
superiority of SIGNet over state-of-the-art methods proposed for both signed
and unsigned networks on several real world datasets from different domains. In
particular, SIGNet offers an approach to generate a richer vocabulary of
features of signed networks to support representation and reasoning.
