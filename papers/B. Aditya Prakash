Got the Flu (or Mumps)? Check the Eigenvalue!

  For a given, arbitrary graph, what is the epidemic threshold? That is, underwhat conditions will a virus result in an epidemic? We provide the super-modeltheorem, which generalizes older results in two important, orthogonaldimensions. The theorem shows that (a) for a wide range of virus propagationmodels (VPM) that include all virus propagation models in standard literature(say, [8][5]), and (b) for any contact graph, the answer always depends on thefirst eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix. We give the proof of the theorem,arithmetic examples for popular VPMs, like flu (SIS), mumps (SIR), SIRS andmore. We also show the implications of our discovery: easy (although sometimescounter-intuitive) answers to `what-if' questions; easier design and evaluationof immunization policies, and significantly faster agent-based simulations.

Distributed Representation of Subgraphs

  Network embeddings have become very popular in learning effective featurerepresentations of networks. Motivated by the recent successes of embeddings innatural language processing, researchers have tried to find network embeddingsin order to exploit machine learning algorithms for mining tasks like nodeclassification and edge prediction. However, most of the work focuses onfinding distributed representations of nodes, which are inherently ill-suitedto tasks such as community detection which are intuitively dependent onsubgraphs.  Here, we propose sub2vec, an unsupervised scalable algorithm to learn featurerepresentations of arbitrary subgraphs. We provide means to characterizesimilarties between subgraphs and provide theoretical analysis of sub2vec anddemonstrate that it preserves the so-called local proximity. We also highlightthe usability of sub2vec by leveraging it for network mining tasks, likecommunity detection. We show that sub2vec gets significant gains overstate-of-the-art methods and node-embedding methods. In particular, sub2vecoffers an approach to generate a richer vocabulary of features of subgraphs tosupport representation and reasoning.

Approximation Algorithms for Reducing the Spectral Radius to Control  Epidemic Spread

  The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network (referred to asthe spectral radius) is an important metric in its own right. Further, forseveral models of epidemic spread on networks (e.g., the `flu-like' SIS model),it has been shown that an epidemic dies out quickly if the spectral radius ofthe graph is below a certain threshold that depends on the model parameters.This motivates a strategy to control epidemic spread by reducing the spectralradius of the underlying network.  In this paper, we develop a suite of provable approximation algorithms forreducing the spectral radius by removing the minimum cost set of edges(modeling quarantining) or nodes (modeling vaccinations), with different timeand quality tradeoffs. Our main algorithm, \textsc{GreedyWalk}, is based on theidea of hitting closed walks of a given length, and gives an$O(\log^2{n})$-approximation, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes; it alsoperforms much better in practice compared to all prior heuristics proposed forthis problem. We further present a novel sparsification method to improve itsrunning time.  In addition, we give a new primal-dual based algorithm with an even betterapproximation guarantee ($O(\log n)$), albeit with slower running time. We alsogive lower bounds on the worst-case performance of some of the popularheuristics. Finally we demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms and theproperties of our solutions via extensive experiments on multiple synthetic andreal networks.

Forecasting the Flu: Designing Social Network Sensors for Epidemics

  Early detection and modeling of a contagious epidemic can provide importantguidance about quelling the contagion, controlling its spread, or the effectivedesign of countermeasures. A topic of recent interest has been to design socialnetwork sensors, i.e., identifying a small set of people who can be monitoredto provide insight into the emergence of an epidemic in a larger population. Weformally pose the problem of designing social network sensors for flu epidemicsand identify two different objectives that could be targeted in such sensordesign problems. Using the graph theoretic notion of dominators we develop anefficient and effective heuristic for forecasting epidemics at lead time. Usingsix city-scale datasets generated by extensive microscopic epidemiologicalsimulations involving millions of individuals, we illustrate the practicalapplicability of our methods and show significant benefits (up to twenty-twodays more lead time) compared to other competitors. Most importantly, wedemonstrate the use of surrogates or proxies for policy makers for designingsocial network sensors that require from nonintrusive knowledge of people tomore information on the relationship among people. The results show that themore intrusive information we obtain, the longer lead time to predict the fluoutbreak up to nine days.

Distributed Representations of Signed Networks

  Recent successes in word embedding and document embedding have motivatedresearchers to explore similar representations for networks and to use suchrepresentations for tasks such as edge prediction, node label prediction, andcommunity detection. Such network embedding methods are largely focused onfinding distributed representations for unsigned networks and are unable todiscover embeddings that respect polarities inherent in edges. We proposeSIGNet, a fast scalable embedding method suitable for signed networks. Ourproposed objective function aims to carefully model the social structureimplicit in signed networks by reinforcing the principles of social balancetheory. Our method builds upon the traditional word2vec family of embeddingapproaches and adds a new targeted node sampling strategy to maintainstructural balance in higher-order neighborhoods. We demonstrate thesuperiority of SIGNet over state-of-the-art methods proposed for both signedand unsigned networks on several real world datasets from different domains. Inparticular, SIGNet offers an approach to generate a richer vocabulary offeatures of signed networks to support representation and reasoning.
