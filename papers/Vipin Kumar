Dirac cone in a non-honeycomb surface alloy

  We demonstrate unexpected occurrence of linear bands resembling Dirac cone atthe zone-center of Au$_2$Sn surface alloy with $\left( \begin{smallmatrix}2&1\\ 1&3 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ surface structure formed by deposition ofabout 0.9 ML Sn on Au(111) at elevated temperature. The surface exhibits anoblique symmetry with unequal lattice constants making it the first twodimensional surface alloy to exhibit Dirac cone with a non-honeycomb lattice.

Quasiperiodic Sn layer

  Quasicrystalline materials exhibit aperiodic long range order and forbiddenrotational symmetries, but show sharp diffraction spots. Although quasicrystalswere discovered more than 30 years ago, elemental quasicrystals have remainedelusive so far. Here, we demonstrate unique characteristics of an elemental Snlayer: it adopts a buckled five-fold quasiperiodic (QP) structure that isdifferent from the icosahedral ($i$)-Al-Pd-Mn substrate. The pseudogap in theelectronic states around the Fermi level that stabilizes a quasicrystal, isfurther deepened in the Sn layer compared to the substrate. On the basis ofdensity functional theory, we relate this intriguing observation to thebuckling with enhanced covalency and $sp^3$ bonding between Sn atoms.Quasiperiodicity is observed up to 1.4 nm (5 ML) at 100 K, a thickness regimewhere the influence of the substrate potential is negligible.

Q-PET: PET with 3rd Eye Quantum Entanglement based Positron Emission  Tomography

  In the present ongoing study, we are proposing a prototype model for positronemission tomography detection technology by introduction of a newdiscriminatory window parameter. It can be a new generation PET detectiontechnique. We introduced Polarization Measurement of the annihilationphotons(generated from the annihilation of positron and electron) as anadditional parameter in proposed prototype, to correlate annihilation photonsof a particular annihilation event. The motivation behind this introduction isQuantum Entanglement relation between the two annihilation photons. These twooppositely emitted photons are linearly polarized at right angle to each other.Simulations studies for this research work are undergoing and some preliminaryresults are presented here.

Harnessing GANs for Addition of New Classes in VSR

  It is an easy task for humans to learn and generalize a problem, perhaps itis due to their ability to visualize and imagine unseen objects and concepts.The power of imagination comes handy especially when interpolating learntexperience (like seen examples) over new classes of a problem. For a machinelearning system, acquiring such powers of imagination are still a hard task. Wepresent a novel approach to low-shot learning that uses the idea of imaginationover unseen classes in a classification problem setting. We combine aclassifier with a `visionary' (i.e., a GAN model) that teaches the classifierto generalize itself over new and unseen classes. This approach can beincorporated into a variety of problem settings where we need a classifier tolearn and generalize itself to new and unseen classes. We compare theperformance of classifiers with and without the visionary GAN model helpingthem.

Mining Electronic Health Records: A Survey

  The continuously increasing cost of the US healthcare system has receivedsignificant attention. Central to the ideas aimed at curbing this trend is theuse of technology, in the form of the mandate to implement electronic healthrecords (EHRs). EHRs consist of patient information such as demographics,medications, laboratory test results, diagnosis codes and procedures. MiningEHRs could lead to improvement in patient health management as EHRs containdetailed information related to disease prognosis for large patientpopulations. In this manuscript, we provide a structured and comprehensiveoverview of data mining techniques for modeling EHR data. We first provide adetailed understanding of the major application areas to which EHR mining hasbeen applied and then discuss the nature of EHR data and its accompanyingchallenges. Next, we describe major approaches used for EHR mining, the metricsassociated with EHRs, and the various study designs. With this foundation, wethen provide a systematic and methodological organization of existing datamining techniques used to model EHRs and discuss ideas for future research. Weconclude this survey with a comprehensive summary of clinical data miningapplications of EHR data, as illustrated in the online supplement.

Physics-guided Neural Networks (PGNN): An Application in Lake  Temperature Modeling

  This paper introduces a novel framework for combining scientific knowledge ofphysics-based models with neural networks to advance scientific discovery. Thisframework, termed as physics-guided neural network (PGNN), leverages the outputof physics-based model simulations along with observational features togenerate predictions using a neural network architecture. Further, this paperpresents a novel framework for using physics-based loss functions in thelearning objective of neural networks, to ensure that the model predictions notonly show lower errors on the training set but are also scientificallyconsistent with the known physics on the unlabeled set. We illustrate theeffectiveness of PGNN for the problem of lake temperature modeling, wherephysical relationships between the temperature, density, and depth of water areused to design a physics-based loss function. By using scientific knowledge toguide the construction and learning of neural networks, we are able to showthat the proposed framework ensures better generalizability as well asscientific consistency of results.

ORBIT: Ordering Based Information Transfer Across Space and Time for  Global Surface Water Monitoring

  Many earth science applications require data at both high spatial andtemporal resolution for effective monitoring of various ecosystem resources.Due to practical limitations in sensor design, there is often a trade-off indifferent resolutions of spatio-temporal datasets and hence a single sensoralone cannot provide the required information. Various data fusion methods havebeen proposed in the literature that mainly rely on individual timesteps whenboth datasets are available to learn a mapping between features values atdifferent resolutions using local relationships between pixels. Earthobservation data is often plagued with spatially and temporally correlatednoise, outliers and missing data due to atmospheric disturbances which pose achallenge in learning the mapping from a local neighborhood at individualtimesteps. In this paper, we aim to exploit time-independent globalrelationships between pixels for robust transfer of information acrossdifferent scales. Specifically, we propose a new framework, ORBIT (OrderingBased Information Transfer) that uses relative ordering constraint among pixelsto transfer information across both time and scales. The effectiveness of theframework is demonstrated for global surface water monitoring using bothsynthetic and real-world datasets.

Discovery of Shifting Patterns in Sequence Classification

  In this paper, we investigate the multi-variate sequence classificationproblem from a multi-instance learning perspective. Real-world sequential datacommonly show discriminative patterns only at specific time periods. Forinstance, we can identify a cropland during its growing season, but it lookssimilar to a barren land after harvest or before planting. Besides, even withinthe same class, the discriminative patterns can appear in different periods ofsequential data. Due to such property, these discriminative patterns are alsoreferred to as shifting patterns. The shifting patterns in sequential dataseverely degrade the performance of traditional classification methods withoutsufficient training data.  We propose a novel sequence classification method by automatically miningshifting patterns from multi-variate sequence. The method employs amulti-instance learning approach to detect shifting patterns while alsomodeling temporal relationships within each multi-instance bag by an LSTM modelto further improve the classification performance. We extensively evaluate ourmethod on two real-world applications - cropland mapping and affective staterecognition. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodin sequence classification performance and in detecting discriminative shiftingpatterns.

Physics Guided Recurrent Neural Networks For Modeling Dynamical Systems:  Application to Monitoring Water Temperature And Quality In Lakes

  In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for combining scientificknowledge within physics-based models and recurrent neural networks to advancescientific discovery in many dynamical systems. We will first describe the useof outputs from physics-based models in learning a hybrid-physics-data model.Then, we further incorporate physical knowledge in real-world dynamical systemsas additional constraints for training recurrent neural networks. We will applythis approach on modeling lake temperature and quality where we take intoaccount the physical constraints along both the depth dimension and timedimension. By using scientific knowledge to guide the construction and learningthe data-driven model, we demonstrate that this method can achieve betterprediction accuracy as well as scientific consistency of results.

Mining Novel Multivariate Relationships in Time Series Data Using  Correlation Networks

  In many domains, there is significant interest in capturing novelrelationships between time series that represent activities recorded atdifferent nodes of a highly complex system. In this paper, we introducemultipoles, a novel class of linear relationships between more than two timeseries. A multipole is a set of time series that have strong linear dependenceamong themselves, with the requirement that each time series makes asignificant contribution to the linear dependence. We demonstrate that mostinteresting multipoles can be identified as cliques of negative correlations ina correlation network. Such cliques are typically rare in a real-worldcorrelation network, which allows us to find almost all multipoles efficientlyusing a clique-enumeration approach. Using our proposed framework, wedemonstrate the utility of multipoles in discovering new physical phenomena intwo scientific domains: climate science and neuroscience. In particular, wediscovered several multipole relationships that are reproducible in multipleother independent datasets and lead to novel domain insights.

Physics Guided RNNs for Modeling Dynamical Systems: A Case Study in  Simulating Lake Temperature Profiles

  This paper proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN)that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementarystrengths and improve the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we showthat a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physical models,while generating outputs consistent with physical laws, and achieving goodgeneralizability. Standard RNNs, even when producing superior predictionaccuracy, often produce physically inconsistent results and lackgeneralizability. We further enhance this approach by using a pre-trainingmethod that leverages the simulated data from a physics-based model to addressthe scarcity of observed data. The PGRNN has the flexibility to incorporateadditional physical constraints and we incorporate a density-depthrelationship. Both enhancements further improve PGRNN performance. Although wepresent and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamicsof temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientificand engineering disciplines where mechanistic (also known as process-based)models are used, e.g., power engineering, climate science, materials science,computational chemistry, and biomedicine.

Influence of anti-site disorder and electron-electron correlations on  the electronic structure of CeMnNi$_4$

  CeMnNi$_4$ exhibits an unusually large spin polarization, but its origin hasbaffled researchers for more than a decade. We use bulk sensitive hard x-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) and density functional theory based on theGreen's function technique to demonstrate the importance of electron-electroncorrelations of both the Ni 3$d$ ($U_{Ni}$) and Mn 3$d$ ($U_{Mn}$) electrons inexplaining the valence band of this multiply correlated material. We show thatMn-Ni anti-site disorder as well as $U_{Ni}$ play crucial role in enhancing itsspin polarization: anti-site disorder broadens a Ni 3$d$ minority-spin peakclose to the Fermi level ($E_F$), while an increase in $U_{Ni}$ shifts ittowards $E_F$, both leading to a significant increase of minority-spin statesat $E_F$. Furthermore, rare occurrence of a valence state transition betweenthe bulk and the surface is demonstrated highlighting the importance of HAXPESin resolving the electronic structure of materials unhindered by surfaceeffects.

Integration of Differential Gene-combination Search and Gene Set  Enrichment Analysis: A General Approach

  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and its variations aim to discovercollections of genes that show moderate but coordinated differences inexpression. However, such techniques may be ineffective if many individualgenes in a phenotype-related gene set have weak discriminative power. Apotential solution is to search for combinations of genes that are highlydifferentiating even when individual genes are not. Although such techniqueshave been developed, these approaches have not been used with GSEA to anysignificant degree because of the large number of potential gene combinationsand the heterogeneity of measures that assess the differentiation provided bygene groups of different sizes.  To integrate the search for differentiating gene combinations and GSEA, wepropose a general framework with two key components: (A) a procedure thatreduces the number of scores to be handled by GSEA to the number of genes bysummarizing the scores of the gene combinations involving a particular gene ina single score, and (B) a procedure to integrate the heterogeneous scores fromcombinations of different sizes and from different gene combination measures bymapping the scores to p-values. Experiments on four gene expression data setsdemonstrate that the integration of GSEA and gene combination search canenhance the power of traditional GSEA by discovering gene sets that includegenes with weak individual differentiation but strong joint discriminativepower. Also, gene sets discovered by the integrative framework share severalcommon biological processes and improve the consistency of the results amongthree lung cancer data sets.

Characterizing Discriminative Patterns

  Discriminative patterns are association patterns that occur withdisproportionate frequency in some classes versus others, and have been studiedunder names such as emerging patterns and contrast sets. Such patterns havedemonstrated considerable value for classification and subgroup discovery, buta detailed understanding of the types of interactions among items in adiscriminative pattern is lacking. To address this issue, we propose tocategorize discriminative patterns according to four types of item interaction:(i) driver-passenger, (ii) coherent, (iii) independent additive and (iv)synergistic beyond independent additive. Either of the last three is ofpractical importance, with the latter two representing a gain in thediscriminative power of a pattern over its subsets. Synergistic patterns aremost restrictive, but perhaps the most interesting since they capture acooperative effect. For domains such as genetic research, differentiating amongthese types of patterns is critical since each yields very different biologicalinterpretations. For general domains, the characterization provides a novelview of the nature of the discriminative patterns in a dataset, which yieldsinsights beyond those provided by current approaches that focus mostly onpattern-based classification and subgroup discovery. This paper presents acomprehensive discussion that defines these four pattern types and investigatestheir properties and their relationship to one another. In addition, theseideas are explored for a variety of datasets (ten UCI datasets, one geneexpression dataset and two genetic-variation datasets). The results demonstratethe existence, characteristics and statistical significance of the differenttypes of patterns. They also illustrate how pattern characterization canprovide novel insights into discriminative pattern mining and thediscriminative structure of different datasets.

Enhancing the functional content of protein interaction networks

  Protein interaction networks are a promising type of data for studyingcomplex biological systems. However, despite the rich information embedded inthese networks, they face important data quality challenges of noise andincompleteness that adversely affect the results obtained from their analysis.Here, we explore the use of the concept of common neighborhood similarity(CNS), which is a form of local structure in networks, to address these issues.Although several CNS measures have been proposed in the literature, anunderstanding of their relative efficacies for the analysis of interactionnetworks has been lacking. We follow the framework of graph transformation toconvert the given interaction network into a transformed network correspondingto a variety of CNS measures evaluated. The effectiveness of each measure isthen estimated by comparing the quality of protein function predictionsobtained from its corresponding transformed network with those from theoriginal network. Using a large set of S. cerevisiae interactions, and a set of136 GO terms, we find that several of the transformed networks produce moreaccurate predictions than those obtained from the original network. Inparticular, the $HC.cont$ measure proposed here performs particularly well forthis task. Further investigation reveals that the two major factorscontributing to this improvement are the abilities of CNS measures, especially$HC.cont$, to prune out noisy edges and introduce new links betweenfunctionally related proteins.

Causal Inference in Observational Data

  Our aging population increasingly suffers from multiple chronic diseasessimultaneously, necessitating the comprehensive treatment of these conditions.Finding the optimal set of drugs for a combinatorial set of diseases is acombinatorial pattern exploration problem. Association rule mining is a populartool for such problems, but the requirement of health care for finding causal,rather than associative, patterns renders association rule mining unsuitable.To address this issue, we propose a novel framework based on the Rubin-Neymancausal model for extracting causal rules from observational data, correctingfor a number of common biases. Specifically, given a set of interventions and aset of items that define subpopulations (e.g., diseases), we wish to find allsubpopulations in which effective intervention combinations exist and in eachsuch subpopulation, we wish to find all intervention combinations such thatdropping any intervention from this combination will reduce the efficacy of thetreatment. A key aspect of our framework is the concept of closed interventionsets which extend the concept of quantifying the effect of a singleintervention to a set of concurrent interventions. We also evaluated our causalrule mining framework on the Electronic Health Records (EHR) data of a largecohort of patients from Mayo Clinic and showed that the patterns we extractedare sufficiently rich to explain the controversial findings in the medicalliterature regarding the effect of a class of cholesterol drugs on Type-IIDiabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

Theory-guided Data Science: A New Paradigm for Scientific Discovery from  Data

  Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains,have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complexphysical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigmthat aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving theeffectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. Theoverarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as anessential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producingscientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientificunderstanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm ofTGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines suchas turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medicalscience, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper,we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy ofresearch themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domainknowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples fromdifferent disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novelresearch for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.

Machine Learning for the Geosciences: Challenges and Opportunities

  Geosciences is a field of great societal relevance that requires solutions toseveral urgent problems facing our humanity and the planet. As geosciencesenters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widelysuccessful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute toproblems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several uniquechallenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novelproblem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This articleintroduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to thesechallenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist foradvancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typicalsources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make itchallenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describesome of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning canplay a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directionsfor methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussingsome of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicableacross all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deepcollaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergisticadvancements in both disciplines.

Spatio-Temporal Data Mining: A Survey of Problems and Methods

  Large volumes of spatio-temporal data are increasingly collected and studiedin diverse domains including, climate science, social sciences, neuroscience,epidemiology, transportation, mobile health, and Earth sciences.Spatio-temporal data differs from relational data for which computationalapproaches are developed in the data mining community for multiple decades, inthat both spatial and temporal attributes are available in addition to theactual measurements/attributes. The presence of these attributes introducesadditional challenges that needs to be dealt with. Approaches for miningspatio-temporal data have been studied for over a decade in the data miningcommunity. In this article we present a broad survey of this relatively youngfield of spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types ofspatio-temporal data and the relevant data mining questions that arise in thecontext of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on the nature of the datamining problem studied, we classify literature on spatio-temporal data mininginto six major categories: clustering, predictive learning, change detection,frequent pattern mining, anomaly detection, and relationship mining. We discussthe various forms of spatio-temporal data mining problems in each of thesecategories.

Mining Sub-Interval Relationships In Time Series Data

  Time-series data is being increasingly collected and stud- ied in severalareas such as neuroscience, climate science, transportation, and social media.Discovery of complex patterns of relationships between individual time-series,using data-driven approaches can improve our understanding of real-worldsystems. While traditional approaches typically study relationships between twoentire time series, many interesting relationships in real-world applicationsexist in small sub-intervals of time while remaining absent or feeble duringother sub-intervals. In this paper, we define the notion of a sub-intervalrelationship (SIR) to capture inter- actions between two time series that areprominent only in certain sub-intervals of time. We propose a novel andefficient approach to find most interesting SIR in a pair of time series. Weevaluate our proposed approach on two real-world datasets from climate scienceand neuroscience domain and demonstrated the scalability and computationalefficiency of our proposed approach. We further evaluated our discovered SIRsbased on a randomization based procedure. Our results indicated the existenceof several such relationships that are statistically significant, some of whichwere also found to have physical interpretation.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Human Genetic Interaction  Networks with Genome-wide Association Data

  Genetic interaction measures how different genes collectively contribute to aphenotype, and can reveal functional compensation and buffering betweenpathways under genetic perturbations. Recently, genome-wide screening forgenetic interactions has revealed genetic interaction networks that providenovel insights either when analyzed by themselves or when integrated with otherfunctional genomic datasets. For higher eukaryotes such as human, the abovereverse-genetics approaches are not straightforward since the phenotypes ofinterest for higher eukaryotes are difficult to study in a cell based assay. Wepropose a general framework for constructing and analyzing human geneticinteraction networks from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataused for case-control studies on complex diseases. Specifically, the approachcontains three major steps: (1) estimating SNP-SNP genetic interactions, (2)identifying linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and mapping SNP-SNP interactionsto block-block interactions, and (3) functional mapping for LD blocks. Weperformed two sets of functional analyses for each of the six datasets used inthe paper, and demonstrated that (i) the constructed genetic interactionnetworks are supported by functional evidence from independent biologicaldatabases, and (ii) the network can be used to discover pairs of compensatorygene modules (between-pathway models) in their joint association with a diseasephenotype. The proposed framework should provide novel insights beyond existingapproaches that either ignore interactions between SNPs or model differentSNP-SNP pairs with genetic interactions separately. Furthermore, our studyprovides evidence that some of the core properties of genetic interactionnetworks based on reverse genetics in model organisms like yeast are alsopresent in genetic interactions revealed by natural variation in humanpopulations.

An Improved Diffuse Foreground Subtraction by ILC method: CMB Map and  Angular Power Spectrum using Planck and WMAP Observations

  We report an improved technique for diffuse foreground minimization fromCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps using a new multi-phase iterativeinternal-linear-combination (ILC) approach in harmonic space. The new procedureconsists of two phases. In phase 1, a diffuse foreground cleaned map isobtained by performing a usual ILC operation in the harmonic space in a singleiteration over the desired portion of the sky. In phase 2, we obtain the finalforeground cleaned map using an iterative ILC approach also in the harmonicspace, however, now, during each iteration of foreground minimization, some ofthe regions of the sky that are not being cleaned in the current iteration, arereplaced by the corresponding cleaned portions of the phase 1 cleaned map. Thenew ILC method nullifies a foreground leakage signal that is otherwiseinevitably present in the old and usual harmonic space iterative ILC method.The new method is flexible to handle input frequency maps, irrespective ofwhether or not they initially have the same instrumental and pixel resolution,by bringing them to a common and maximum possible beam and pixel resolution atthe beginning of the analysis. This dramatically reduces data redundancy andhence memory usage and computational cost. During the ILC weight calculation itavoids any need to deconvolve partial sky spherical harmonic coefficients bythe beam and pixel window functions, which in strict mathematical sense, is notwell-defined for azimuthally symmetric window functions. Using WMAP 9-year andPlanck-2015 published frequency maps we obtain a pair of foreground cleaned CMBmaps and CMB angular power spectrum. Our power spectrum match well withPlanck-2015 results, with some difference. Finally, we show that the weightsfor ILC foreground minimization have an intrinsic characteristic that it tendsto produce a statistically isotropic CMB map as well.

Research and Education in Computational Science and Engineering

  Over the past two decades the field of computational science and engineering(CSE) has penetrated both basic and applied research in academia, industry, andlaboratories to advance discovery, optimize systems, support decision-makers,and educate the scientific and engineering workforce. Informed by centuries oftheory and experiment, CSE performs computational experiments to answerquestions that neither theory nor experiment alone is equipped to answer. CSEprovides scientists and engineers of all persuasions with algorithmicinventions and software systems that transcend disciplines and scales. Carriedon a wave of digital technology, CSE brings the power of parallelism to bear ontroves of data. Mathematics-based advanced computing has become a prevalentmeans of discovery and innovation in essentially all areas of science,engineering, technology, and society; and the CSE community is at the core ofthis transformation. However, a combination of disruptivedevelopments---including the architectural complexity of extreme-scalecomputing, the data revolution that engulfs the planet, and the specializationrequired to follow the applications to new frontiers---is redefining the scopeand reach of the CSE endeavor. This report describes the rapid expansion of CSEand the challenges to sustaining its bold advances. The report also presentsstrategies and directions for CSE research and education for the next decade.

Physics Potential of the ICAL detector at the India-based Neutrino  Observatory (INO)

  The upcoming 50 kt magnetized iron calorimeter (ICAL) detector at theIndia-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is designed to study the atmosphericneutrinos and antineutrinos separately over a wide range of energies and pathlengths. The primary focus of this experiment is to explore the Earth mattereffects by observing the energy and zenith angle dependence of the atmosphericneutrinos in the multi-GeV range. This study will be crucial to address some ofthe outstanding issues in neutrino oscillation physics, including thefundamental issue of neutrino mass hierarchy. In this document, we present thephysics potential of the detector as obtained from realistic detectorsimulations. We describe the simulation framework, the neutrino interactions inthe detector, and the expected response of the detector to particles traversingit. The ICAL detector can determine the energy and direction of the muons to ahigh precision, and in addition, its sensitivity to multi-GeV hadrons increasesits physics reach substantially. Its charge identification capability, andhence its ability to distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos, makes it anefficient detector for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy. In this report,we outline the analyses carried out for the determination of neutrino masshierarchy and precision measurements of atmospheric neutrino mixing parametersat ICAL, and give the expected physics reach of the detector with 10 years ofruntime. We also explore the potential of ICAL for probing new physicsscenarios like CPT violation and the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Evidence for the decay B0 --> K+K-pi0

  We report a search for charmless hadronic decays of neutral B mesons to thefinal state K+K-pi0. The results are based on a 711 fb^-1 data sample thatcontains 772x10^6 BB-bar pairs, and was collected at the Y(4S) resonance withthe Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We find thefirst evidence for this decay with a significance of 3.5 standard deviationsand measure its branching fraction as BF(B0 --> K+K-pi0) = [2.17 +/- 0.60(stat)+/- 0.24 (syst)]x10^-6.

The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment: Exploring Fundamental Symmetries  of the Universe

  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early Universe, thedynamics of the supernova bursts that produced the heavy elements necessary forlife and whether protons eventually decay --- these mysteries at the forefrontof particle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the earlyevolution of our Universe, its current state and its eventual fate. TheLong-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) represents an extensively developedplan for a world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions. LBNEis conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensityneutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at FermiNational Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstreamof the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployedas a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground ResearchFacility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine inLead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source atFermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrinocharge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yetcost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and canaccommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptionalcombination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, andpotential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facilityfor the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from aroundthe globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year programof exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview ofLBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physicsworldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it willpossess.
