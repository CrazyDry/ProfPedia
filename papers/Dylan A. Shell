Toward a language-theoretic foundation for planning and filtering

  We address problems underlying the algorithmic question of automating theco-design of robot hardware in tandem with its apposite software. Specifically,we consider the impact that degradations of a robot's sensor and actuationsuites may have on the ability of that robot to complete its tasks. Weintroduce a new formal structure that generalizes and consolidates a variety ofwell-known structures including many forms of plans, planning problems, andfilters, into a single data structure called a procrustean graph, and givethese graph structures semantics in terms of ideas based in formal languagetheory. We describe a collection of operations on procrustean graphs (bothsemantics-preserving and semantics-mutating), and show how a family ofquestions about the destructiveness of a change to the robot hardware can beanswered by applying these operations. We also highlight the connectionsbetween this new approach and existing threads of research, includingcombinatorial filtering, Erdmann's strategy complexes, and hybrid automata.

Decentralized State Estimation via a Hybrid of Consensus and Covariance  intersection

  This paper presents a new recursive information consensus filter fordecentralized dynamic-state estimation. No structure is assumed about thetopology of the network and local estimators are assumed to have access only tolocal information. The network need not be connected at all times. Consensusover priors which might become correlated is performed through CovarianceIntersection (CI) and consensus over new information is handled using weightsbased on a Metropolis Hastings Markov Chains. We establish bounds forestimation performance and show that our method produces unbiased conservativeestimates that are better than CI. The performance of the proposed method isevaluated and compared with competing algorithms on an atmospheric dispersionproblem.

Finding plans subject to stipulations on what information they divulge

  Motivated by applications where privacy is important, we consider planningproblems for robots acting in the presence of an observer. We first formulateand then solve planning problems subject to stipulations on the informationdivulged during plan execution---the appropriate solution concept being both aplan and an information disclosure policy. We pose this class of problem undera worst-case model within the framework of procrustean graphs, formulating thedisclosure policy as a particular type of map on edge labels. We devisealgorithms that, given a planning problem supplemented with an informationstipulation, can find a plan, associated disclosure policy, or both if someexists. Both the plan and associated disclosure policy may depend subtlety onadditional information available to the observer, such as whether the observerknows the robot's plan (e.g., leaked via a side-channel). Our implementationfinds a plan and a suitable disclosure policy, jointly, when any such pairexists, albeit for small problem instances.

What does my knowing your plans tell me?

  For robots acting in the presence of observers, we examine the informationthat is divulged if the observer is party to the robot's plan. Privacyconstraints are specified as the stipulations on what can be inferred duringplan execution. We imagine a case in which the robot's plan is divulgedbeforehand, so that the observer can use this {\em a priori} information alongwith the disclosed executions. The divulged plan, which can be represented by aprocrustean graph, is shown to undermine privacy precisely to the extent thatit can eliminate action-observation sequences that will never appear in theplan. Future work will consider how the divulged plan might be sought as theoutput of a planning procedure.

Non-Uniform Robot Densities in Vibration Driven Swarms Using Phase  Separation Theory

  In robot swarms operating under highly restrictive sensing and communicationconstraints, individuals may need to use direct physical proximity tofacilitate information exchange. However, in certain task-related scenarios,this requirement might conflict with the need for robots to spread out in theenvironment, e.g., for distributed sensing or surveillance applications. Thispaper demonstrates how a swarm of minimally-equipped robots can formhigh-density robot aggregates which coexist with lower robot densities in thedomain. We envision a scenario where a swarm of vibration-driven robots---whichsit atop bristles and achieve directed motion by vibrating them---move somewhatrandomly in an environment while colliding with each other. Theoreticaltechniques from the study of far-from-equilibrium collectives and statisticalmechanics clarify the mechanisms underlying the formation of these high and lowdensity regions. Specifically, we capitalize on a transformation that connectsthe collective properties of a system of self-propelled particles with that ofa well-studied molecular fluid system, thereby inheriting the rich theory ofequilibrium thermodynamics. This connection is a formal one and is a relativelyrecent result in studies of motility induced phase separation; it is previouslyunexplored in the context of robotics. Real robot experiments as well assimulations illustrate how inter-robot collisions can precipitate the formationof non-uniform robot densities in a closed and bounded region.

Complete characterization of a class of privacy-preserving tracking  problems

  We examine the problem of target tracking whilst simultaneously preservingthe target's privacy as epitomized by the robotic panda tracking scenario,which O'Kane introduced at the 2008 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations ofRobotics in order to elegantly illustrate the utility of ignorance. The presentpaper reconsiders his formulation and the tracking strategy he proposed, alongwith its completeness. We explore how the capabilities of the robot and pandaaffect the feasibility of tracking with a privacy stipulation, uncoveringintrinsic limits, no matter the strategy employed. This paper begins with aone-dimensional setting and, putting the trivially infeasible problems aside,analyzes the strategy space as a function of problem parameters. We show thatit is not possible to actively track the target as well as protect its privacyfor every nontrivial pair of tracking and privacy stipulations. Secondly,feasibility can be sensitive, in several cases, to the information available tothe robot initially. Quite naturally in the one-dimensional model, one mayquantify sensing power by the number of perceptual (or output) classesavailable to the robot. The robot's power to achieve privacy-preservingtracking is bounded, converging asymptotically with increasing sensing power.We analyze the entire space of possible tracking problems, characterizing everyinstance as either achievable, constructively by giving a policy where oneexists (some of which depend on the initial information), or proving theinstance impossible. Finally, to relate some of the impossibility results inone dimension to their higher-dimensional counterparts, including the planarpanda tracking problem studied by O'Kane, we establish a connection betweentracking dimensionality and the sensing power of a one-dimensional robot.

A New Method to Quantify Environment and Model Ram-Pressure Stripping in  N-Body Simulations

  We introduce a Local Background Environment (LBE) estimator that can bemeasured in and around every galaxy or its dark matter subhalo inhigh-resolution cosmological simulations. The LBE is designed to capture theinfluence of environmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping on theformation and evolution of galaxies in semi-analytical models. We define theLBE directly from the particle data within an adaptive spherical shell, anddevise a Gaussian mixture estimator to separate background particles frompreviously unidentified subhalo particles. Analyzing the LBE properties, wefind that the LBE of satellite galaxies is not at rest with respect to theirhost halo, in contrast to typical assumptions. The orientations of thevelocities of a subhalo and its LBE are well aligned in the outer infallregions of haloes, but decorrelated near halo center. Significantly, there isno abrupt change in LBE velocity or density at the halo virial radius. Thissuggests that stripping should also happen beyond this radius. Therefore, weuse the time-evolving LBE of galaxies to develop a method to better account forram-pressure stripping within the Munich semi-analytical model, L-Galaxies.Overall, our new approach results in a significant increase in gas strippingacross cosmic time. Central galaxies, as well as satellites beyond the virialradius, can lose a significant fraction of their hot halo gas. As a result, thegas fractions and star formation rates of satellite galaxies are suppressedrelative to the fiducial model, although the stellar masses and global stellarmass functions are largely unchanged.

Line-driven ablation of circumstellar disks: I. Optically thin decretion  disks of classical Oe/Be stars

  The extreme luminosities of hot, massive stars drive strong stellar windsthrough UV line-scattering. For OB stars with an orbiting circumstellar disk,we explore the effect of such line-scattering in ablating disk material,initially focusing on the marginally optically thin decretion disks ofclassical Oe and Be stars. For this we apply a multi-dimensionalradiation-hydrodynamics code, assuming optically thin ray tracing for thestellar continuum and a multi-ray Sobolev treatment of the line transfer. Thisaccounts for desaturation of line-absorption by Keplerian shear in the disk,and associated driving by non-radial photons. Results show dense,intermediate-speed surface ablation, consistent with the strong, blue-shiftedabsorption seen in UV wind lines of Be shell stars. The asymptotic ablationrate is typically an order-unity factor times the stellar wind mass loss rate,leading to disk destruction times of order months to years for Be disks,consistent with observations. The much stronger radiative forces of O starsreduce this time to order days, making sustaining a disk difficult, and soproviding a natural explanation for the rarity of Galactic Oe stars.Additionally, the weakened line-driving at lower metallicity implies both areduction in the winds that help spin-down stars from near-critical rotation,and in the ablation of decretion disks, thus providing a natural explanationfor the higher fraction of Classical Be stars, and the presence of Oe stars, inthe Magellanic Clouds. We conclude with a discussion of future extensions tostudy line-driven ablation of denser, optically thick, accretion disks aroundpre-main-sequence massive stars.

Robot Design: Formalisms, Representations, and the Role of the Designer

  The objective of this paper is to distill the following essential idea fromthe RSS 2016 Workshop on Minimality and Design Automation and the RSS 2017Workshop on Minimality and Trade-offs in Automated Robot Design:  The information abstractions popular within robotics, designed as they wereto address insulated sub-problems, are currently inadequate for designautomation.  This paper's first aim is to draw together multiple threads---specificallythose of formalization, minimality, automation, and integration---and to arguethat robot design questions involve some of the most interesting andfundamental challenges for the discipline. While most efforts in automatingrobot design have focused on optimization of hardware, robot design is alsoinextricably linked to the design of the internal state of the robot, how thatinternal state interacts with sensors and actuators, and how taskspecifications are designed within this context. Focusing attention on thoseconsiderations is worthwhile for the study of robot design because they arecurrently in a critical intellectual sweet spot, being out of reachtechnically, but only just.  The second ingredient of this paper forms a roadmap. It emphasizes twoaspects: (1) the role of models in robot design, a reprise of the old chestnutabout representation in robotics (namely, that "the world is its own bestmodel"); (2) a consideration of the human-element within the envisioned scheme.
