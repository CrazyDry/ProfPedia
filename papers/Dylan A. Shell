Toward a language-theoretic foundation for planning and filtering

  We address problems underlying the algorithmic question of automating the
co-design of robot hardware in tandem with its apposite software. Specifically,
we consider the impact that degradations of a robot's sensor and actuation
suites may have on the ability of that robot to complete its tasks. We
introduce a new formal structure that generalizes and consolidates a variety of
well-known structures including many forms of plans, planning problems, and
filters, into a single data structure called a procrustean graph, and give
these graph structures semantics in terms of ideas based in formal language
theory. We describe a collection of operations on procrustean graphs (both
semantics-preserving and semantics-mutating), and show how a family of
questions about the destructiveness of a change to the robot hardware can be
answered by applying these operations. We also highlight the connections
between this new approach and existing threads of research, including
combinatorial filtering, Erdmann's strategy complexes, and hybrid automata.


Decentralized State Estimation via a Hybrid of Consensus and Covariance
  intersection

  This paper presents a new recursive information consensus filter for
decentralized dynamic-state estimation. No structure is assumed about the
topology of the network and local estimators are assumed to have access only to
local information. The network need not be connected at all times. Consensus
over priors which might become correlated is performed through Covariance
Intersection (CI) and consensus over new information is handled using weights
based on a Metropolis Hastings Markov Chains. We establish bounds for
estimation performance and show that our method produces unbiased conservative
estimates that are better than CI. The performance of the proposed method is
evaluated and compared with competing algorithms on an atmospheric dispersion
problem.


Finding plans subject to stipulations on what information they divulge

  Motivated by applications where privacy is important, we consider planning
problems for robots acting in the presence of an observer. We first formulate
and then solve planning problems subject to stipulations on the information
divulged during plan execution---the appropriate solution concept being both a
plan and an information disclosure policy. We pose this class of problem under
a worst-case model within the framework of procrustean graphs, formulating the
disclosure policy as a particular type of map on edge labels. We devise
algorithms that, given a planning problem supplemented with an information
stipulation, can find a plan, associated disclosure policy, or both if some
exists. Both the plan and associated disclosure policy may depend subtlety on
additional information available to the observer, such as whether the observer
knows the robot's plan (e.g., leaked via a side-channel). Our implementation
finds a plan and a suitable disclosure policy, jointly, when any such pair
exists, albeit for small problem instances.


What does my knowing your plans tell me?

  For robots acting in the presence of observers, we examine the information
that is divulged if the observer is party to the robot's plan. Privacy
constraints are specified as the stipulations on what can be inferred during
plan execution. We imagine a case in which the robot's plan is divulged
beforehand, so that the observer can use this {\em a priori} information along
with the disclosed executions. The divulged plan, which can be represented by a
procrustean graph, is shown to undermine privacy precisely to the extent that
it can eliminate action-observation sequences that will never appear in the
plan. Future work will consider how the divulged plan might be sought as the
output of a planning procedure.


Non-Uniform Robot Densities in Vibration Driven Swarms Using Phase
  Separation Theory

  In robot swarms operating under highly restrictive sensing and communication
constraints, individuals may need to use direct physical proximity to
facilitate information exchange. However, in certain task-related scenarios,
this requirement might conflict with the need for robots to spread out in the
environment, e.g., for distributed sensing or surveillance applications. This
paper demonstrates how a swarm of minimally-equipped robots can form
high-density robot aggregates which coexist with lower robot densities in the
domain. We envision a scenario where a swarm of vibration-driven robots---which
sit atop bristles and achieve directed motion by vibrating them---move somewhat
randomly in an environment while colliding with each other. Theoretical
techniques from the study of far-from-equilibrium collectives and statistical
mechanics clarify the mechanisms underlying the formation of these high and low
density regions. Specifically, we capitalize on a transformation that connects
the collective properties of a system of self-propelled particles with that of
a well-studied molecular fluid system, thereby inheriting the rich theory of
equilibrium thermodynamics. This connection is a formal one and is a relatively
recent result in studies of motility induced phase separation; it is previously
unexplored in the context of robotics. Real robot experiments as well as
simulations illustrate how inter-robot collisions can precipitate the formation
of non-uniform robot densities in a closed and bounded region.


Complete characterization of a class of privacy-preserving tracking
  problems

  We examine the problem of target tracking whilst simultaneously preserving
the target's privacy as epitomized by the robotic panda tracking scenario,
which O'Kane introduced at the 2008 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of
Robotics in order to elegantly illustrate the utility of ignorance. The present
paper reconsiders his formulation and the tracking strategy he proposed, along
with its completeness. We explore how the capabilities of the robot and panda
affect the feasibility of tracking with a privacy stipulation, uncovering
intrinsic limits, no matter the strategy employed. This paper begins with a
one-dimensional setting and, putting the trivially infeasible problems aside,
analyzes the strategy space as a function of problem parameters. We show that
it is not possible to actively track the target as well as protect its privacy
for every nontrivial pair of tracking and privacy stipulations. Secondly,
feasibility can be sensitive, in several cases, to the information available to
the robot initially. Quite naturally in the one-dimensional model, one may
quantify sensing power by the number of perceptual (or output) classes
available to the robot. The robot's power to achieve privacy-preserving
tracking is bounded, converging asymptotically with increasing sensing power.
We analyze the entire space of possible tracking problems, characterizing every
instance as either achievable, constructively by giving a policy where one
exists (some of which depend on the initial information), or proving the
instance impossible. Finally, to relate some of the impossibility results in
one dimension to their higher-dimensional counterparts, including the planar
panda tracking problem studied by O'Kane, we establish a connection between
tracking dimensionality and the sensing power of a one-dimensional robot.


A New Method to Quantify Environment and Model Ram-Pressure Stripping in
  N-Body Simulations

  We introduce a Local Background Environment (LBE) estimator that can be
measured in and around every galaxy or its dark matter subhalo in
high-resolution cosmological simulations. The LBE is designed to capture the
influence of environmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping on the
formation and evolution of galaxies in semi-analytical models. We define the
LBE directly from the particle data within an adaptive spherical shell, and
devise a Gaussian mixture estimator to separate background particles from
previously unidentified subhalo particles. Analyzing the LBE properties, we
find that the LBE of satellite galaxies is not at rest with respect to their
host halo, in contrast to typical assumptions. The orientations of the
velocities of a subhalo and its LBE are well aligned in the outer infall
regions of haloes, but decorrelated near halo center. Significantly, there is
no abrupt change in LBE velocity or density at the halo virial radius. This
suggests that stripping should also happen beyond this radius. Therefore, we
use the time-evolving LBE of galaxies to develop a method to better account for
ram-pressure stripping within the Munich semi-analytical model, L-Galaxies.
Overall, our new approach results in a significant increase in gas stripping
across cosmic time. Central galaxies, as well as satellites beyond the virial
radius, can lose a significant fraction of their hot halo gas. As a result, the
gas fractions and star formation rates of satellite galaxies are suppressed
relative to the fiducial model, although the stellar masses and global stellar
mass functions are largely unchanged.


Line-driven ablation of circumstellar disks: I. Optically thin decretion
  disks of classical Oe/Be stars

  The extreme luminosities of hot, massive stars drive strong stellar winds
through UV line-scattering. For OB stars with an orbiting circumstellar disk,
we explore the effect of such line-scattering in ablating disk material,
initially focusing on the marginally optically thin decretion disks of
classical Oe and Be stars. For this we apply a multi-dimensional
radiation-hydrodynamics code, assuming optically thin ray tracing for the
stellar continuum and a multi-ray Sobolev treatment of the line transfer. This
accounts for desaturation of line-absorption by Keplerian shear in the disk,
and associated driving by non-radial photons. Results show dense,
intermediate-speed surface ablation, consistent with the strong, blue-shifted
absorption seen in UV wind lines of Be shell stars. The asymptotic ablation
rate is typically an order-unity factor times the stellar wind mass loss rate,
leading to disk destruction times of order months to years for Be disks,
consistent with observations. The much stronger radiative forces of O stars
reduce this time to order days, making sustaining a disk difficult, and so
providing a natural explanation for the rarity of Galactic Oe stars.
Additionally, the weakened line-driving at lower metallicity implies both a
reduction in the winds that help spin-down stars from near-critical rotation,
and in the ablation of decretion disks, thus providing a natural explanation
for the higher fraction of Classical Be stars, and the presence of Oe stars, in
the Magellanic Clouds. We conclude with a discussion of future extensions to
study line-driven ablation of denser, optically thick, accretion disks around
pre-main-sequence massive stars.


Robot Design: Formalisms, Representations, and the Role of the Designer

  The objective of this paper is to distill the following essential idea from
the RSS 2016 Workshop on Minimality and Design Automation and the RSS 2017
Workshop on Minimality and Trade-offs in Automated Robot Design:
  The information abstractions popular within robotics, designed as they were
to address insulated sub-problems, are currently inadequate for design
automation.
  This paper's first aim is to draw together multiple threads---specifically
those of formalization, minimality, automation, and integration---and to argue
that robot design questions involve some of the most interesting and
fundamental challenges for the discipline. While most efforts in automating
robot design have focused on optimization of hardware, robot design is also
inextricably linked to the design of the internal state of the robot, how that
internal state interacts with sensors and actuators, and how task
specifications are designed within this context. Focusing attention on those
considerations is worthwhile for the study of robot design because they are
currently in a critical intellectual sweet spot, being out of reach
technically, but only just.
  The second ingredient of this paper forms a roadmap. It emphasizes two
aspects: (1) the role of models in robot design, a reprise of the old chestnut
about representation in robotics (namely, that "the world is its own best
model"); (2) a consideration of the human-element within the envisioned scheme.
