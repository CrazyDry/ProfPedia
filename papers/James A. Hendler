A likely planet-induced gap in the disk around T Cha

  We present high resolution ($0.11"\times0.06"$) 3mm ALMA observations of the
highly inclined transition disk around the star T Cha. Our continuum image
reveals multiple dust structures: an inner disk, a spatially resolved dust gap,
and an outer ring. When fitting sky-brightness models to the real component of
the 3mm visibilities, we infer that the inner emission is compact ($\le1$au in
radius), the gap width is between 18-28 au, and the emission from the outer
ring peaks at $\sim36$ au. We compare our ALMA image with previously published
1.6$\mu$m VLT/SPHERE imagery. This comparison reveals that the location of the
outer ring is wavelength dependent. More specifically, the peak emission of the
3mm ring is at a larger radial distance than that of the 1.6$\mu$m ring,
suggesting that millimeter-sized grains in the outer disk are located further
away from the central star than micron-sized grains. We discuss different
scenarios to explain our findings, including dead zones, star-driven
photoevaporation, and planet-disk interactions. We find that the most likely
origin of the dust gap is from an embedded planet, and estimate --- for a
single planet scenario --- that T Cha's gap is carved by a $1.2M_{jup}$ planet.


Graph Analytics for anomaly detection in homogeneous wireless networks -
  A Simulation Approach

  In the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are exposed to various kinds of
attacks when connected to the Internet. An attack detection mechanism that
understands the limitations of these severely resource-constrained devices is
necessary. This is important since current approaches are either customized for
wireless networks or for the conventional Internet with heavy data
transmission. Also, the detection mechanism need not always be as
sophisticated. Simply signaling that an attack is taking place may be enough in
some situations, for example in NIDS using anomaly detection. In graph
networks, central nodes are the nodes that bear the most influence in the
network. The purpose of this research is to explore experimentally the
relationship between the behavior of central nodes and anomaly detection when
an attack spreads through a network. As a result, we propose a novel anomaly
detection approach using this unique methodology which has been unexplored so
far in communication networks. Also, in the experiment, we identify presence of
an attack originating and propagating throughout a network of IoT using our
methodology.


Exploiting Class Learnability in Noisy Data

  In many domains, collecting sufficient labeled training data for supervised
machine learning requires easily accessible but noisy sources, such as
crowdsourcing services or tagged Web data. Noisy labels occur frequently in
data sets harvested via these means, sometimes resulting in entire classes of
data on which learned classifiers generalize poorly. For real world
applications, we argue that it can be beneficial to avoid training on such
classes entirely. In this work, we aim to explore the classes in a given data
set, and guide supervised training to spend time on a class proportional to its
learnability. By focusing the training process, we aim to improve model
generalization on classes with a strong signal. To that end, we develop an
online algorithm that works in conjunction with classifier and training
algorithm, iteratively selecting training data for the classifier based on how
well it appears to generalize on each class. Testing our approach on a variety
of data sets, we show our algorithm learns to focus on classes for which the
model has low generalization error relative to strong baselines, yielding a
classifier with good performance on learnable classes.


Knowledge Integration for Disease Characterization: A Breast Cancer
  Example

  With the rapid advancements in cancer research, the information that is
useful for characterizing disease, staging tumors, and creating treatment and
survivorship plans has been changing at a pace that creates challenges when
physicians try to remain current. One example involves increasing usage of
biomarkers when characterizing the pathologic prognostic stage of a breast
tumor. We present our semantic technology approach to support cancer
characterization and demonstrate it in our end-to-end prototype system that
collects the newest breast cancer staging criteria from authoritative oncology
manuals to construct an ontology for breast cancer. Using a tool we developed
that utilizes this ontology, physician-facing applications can be used to
quickly stage a new patient to support identifying risks, treatment options,
and monitoring plans based on authoritative and best practice guidelines.
Physicians can also re-stage existing patients or patient populations, allowing
them to find patients whose stage has changed in a given patient cohort. As new
guidelines emerge, using our proposed mechanism, which is grounded by semantic
technologies for ingesting new data from staging manuals, we have created an
enriched cancer staging ontology that integrates relevant data from several
sources with very little human intervention.


Feature-based reformulation of entities in triple pattern queries

  Knowledge graphs encode uniquely identifiable entities to other entities or
literal values by means of relationships, thus enabling semantically rich
querying over the stored data. Typically, the semantics of such queries are
often crisp thereby resulting in crisp answers. Query log statistics show that
a majority of the queries issued to knowledge graphs are often entity centric
queries. When a user needs additional answers the state-of-the-art in assisting
users is to rewrite the original query resulting in a set of approximations.
Several strategies have been proposed in past to address this. They typically
move up the taxonomy to relax a specific element to a more generic element.
Entities don't have a taxonomy and they end up being generalized. To address
this issue, in this paper, we propose an entity centric reformulation strategy
that utilizes schema information and entity features present in the graph to
suggest rewrites. Once the features are identified, the entity in concern is
reformulated as a set of features. Since entities can have a large number of
features, we introduce strategies that select the top-k most relevant and
{informative ranked features and augment them to the original query to create a
valid reformulation. We then evaluate our approach by showing that our
reformulation strategy produces results that are more informative when compared
with state-of-the-art


Security and Privacy of performing Data Analytics in the cloud - A
  three-way handshake of Technology, Policy, and Management

  Cloud platform came into existence primarily to accelerate IT delivery and to
promote innovation. To this point, it has performed largely well to the
expectations of technologists, businesses and customers. The service aspect of
this technology has paved the road for a faster set up of infrastructure and
related goals for both startups and established organizations. This has further
led to quicker delivery of many user-friendly applications to the market while
proving to be a commercially viable option to companies with limited resources.
On the technology front, the creation and adoption of this ecosystem has
allowed easy collection of massive data from various sources at one place,
where the place is sometimes referred as just the cloud. Efficient data mining
can be performed on raw data to extract potentially useful information, which
was not possible at this scale before. Targeted advertising is a common example
that can help businesses. Despite these promising offerings, concerns around
security and privacy of user information suppressed wider acceptance and an
all-encompassing deployment of the cloud platform. In this paper, we discuss
security and privacy concerns that occur due to data exchanging hands between a
cloud servicer provider (CSP) and the primary cloud user - the data collector,
from the content generator. We offer solutions that encompass technology,
policy and sound management of the cloud service asserting that this approach
has the potential to provide a holistic solution.


WhatsApp security and role of metadata in preserving privacy

  WhatsApp messenger is arguably the most popular mobile app available on all
smart-phones. Over one billion people worldwide for free messaging, calling,
and media sharing use it. In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a default
end-to-end encrypted service. This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls,
videos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read by
any unauthorized entity since WhatsApp. In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp
messaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on
its privacy preservation mechanisms. We report that the Signal Protocol, which
forms the basis of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption, does offer protection
against forward secrecy, and MITM to a large extent. Finally, we argue that
simply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy. The metadata
can reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their
patterns, and personal information. This paper elaborates on the security
architecture of WhatsApp and performs an analysis on the various protocols
used. This enlightens us on the status quo of the app security and what further
measures can be used to fill existing gaps without compromising the usability.
We start by describing the following (i) important concepts that need to be
understood to properly understand security, (ii) the security architecture,
(iii) security evaluation, (iv) followed by a summary of our work. Some of the
important concepts that we cover in this paper before evaluating the
architecture are - end-to-end encryption (E2EE), signal protocol, and
curve25519. The description of the security architecture covers key management,
end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp, Authentication Mechanism, Message Exchange,
and finally the security evaluation. We then cover importance of metadata and
role it plays in conserving privacy with respect to whatsapp.
