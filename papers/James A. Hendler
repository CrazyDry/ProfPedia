A likely planet-induced gap in the disk around T Cha

  We present high resolution ($0.11"\times0.06"$) 3mm ALMA observations of thehighly inclined transition disk around the star T Cha. Our continuum imagereveals multiple dust structures: an inner disk, a spatially resolved dust gap,and an outer ring. When fitting sky-brightness models to the real component ofthe 3mm visibilities, we infer that the inner emission is compact ($\le1$au inradius), the gap width is between 18-28 au, and the emission from the outerring peaks at $\sim36$ au. We compare our ALMA image with previously published1.6$\mu$m VLT/SPHERE imagery. This comparison reveals that the location of theouter ring is wavelength dependent. More specifically, the peak emission of the3mm ring is at a larger radial distance than that of the 1.6$\mu$m ring,suggesting that millimeter-sized grains in the outer disk are located furtheraway from the central star than micron-sized grains. We discuss differentscenarios to explain our findings, including dead zones, star-drivenphotoevaporation, and planet-disk interactions. We find that the most likelyorigin of the dust gap is from an embedded planet, and estimate --- for asingle planet scenario --- that T Cha's gap is carved by a $1.2M_{jup}$ planet.

Graph Analytics for anomaly detection in homogeneous wireless networks -  A Simulation Approach

  In the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are exposed to various kinds ofattacks when connected to the Internet. An attack detection mechanism thatunderstands the limitations of these severely resource-constrained devices isnecessary. This is important since current approaches are either customized forwireless networks or for the conventional Internet with heavy datatransmission. Also, the detection mechanism need not always be assophisticated. Simply signaling that an attack is taking place may be enough insome situations, for example in NIDS using anomaly detection. In graphnetworks, central nodes are the nodes that bear the most influence in thenetwork. The purpose of this research is to explore experimentally therelationship between the behavior of central nodes and anomaly detection whenan attack spreads through a network. As a result, we propose a novel anomalydetection approach using this unique methodology which has been unexplored sofar in communication networks. Also, in the experiment, we identify presence ofan attack originating and propagating throughout a network of IoT using ourmethodology.

Exploiting Class Learnability in Noisy Data

  In many domains, collecting sufficient labeled training data for supervisedmachine learning requires easily accessible but noisy sources, such ascrowdsourcing services or tagged Web data. Noisy labels occur frequently indata sets harvested via these means, sometimes resulting in entire classes ofdata on which learned classifiers generalize poorly. For real worldapplications, we argue that it can be beneficial to avoid training on suchclasses entirely. In this work, we aim to explore the classes in a given dataset, and guide supervised training to spend time on a class proportional to itslearnability. By focusing the training process, we aim to improve modelgeneralization on classes with a strong signal. To that end, we develop anonline algorithm that works in conjunction with classifier and trainingalgorithm, iteratively selecting training data for the classifier based on howwell it appears to generalize on each class. Testing our approach on a varietyof data sets, we show our algorithm learns to focus on classes for which themodel has low generalization error relative to strong baselines, yielding aclassifier with good performance on learnable classes.

Knowledge Integration for Disease Characterization: A Breast Cancer  Example

  With the rapid advancements in cancer research, the information that isuseful for characterizing disease, staging tumors, and creating treatment andsurvivorship plans has been changing at a pace that creates challenges whenphysicians try to remain current. One example involves increasing usage ofbiomarkers when characterizing the pathologic prognostic stage of a breasttumor. We present our semantic technology approach to support cancercharacterization and demonstrate it in our end-to-end prototype system thatcollects the newest breast cancer staging criteria from authoritative oncologymanuals to construct an ontology for breast cancer. Using a tool we developedthat utilizes this ontology, physician-facing applications can be used toquickly stage a new patient to support identifying risks, treatment options,and monitoring plans based on authoritative and best practice guidelines.Physicians can also re-stage existing patients or patient populations, allowingthem to find patients whose stage has changed in a given patient cohort. As newguidelines emerge, using our proposed mechanism, which is grounded by semantictechnologies for ingesting new data from staging manuals, we have created anenriched cancer staging ontology that integrates relevant data from severalsources with very little human intervention.

Feature-based reformulation of entities in triple pattern queries

  Knowledge graphs encode uniquely identifiable entities to other entities orliteral values by means of relationships, thus enabling semantically richquerying over the stored data. Typically, the semantics of such queries areoften crisp thereby resulting in crisp answers. Query log statistics show thata majority of the queries issued to knowledge graphs are often entity centricqueries. When a user needs additional answers the state-of-the-art in assistingusers is to rewrite the original query resulting in a set of approximations.Several strategies have been proposed in past to address this. They typicallymove up the taxonomy to relax a specific element to a more generic element.Entities don't have a taxonomy and they end up being generalized. To addressthis issue, in this paper, we propose an entity centric reformulation strategythat utilizes schema information and entity features present in the graph tosuggest rewrites. Once the features are identified, the entity in concern isreformulated as a set of features. Since entities can have a large number offeatures, we introduce strategies that select the top-k most relevant and{informative ranked features and augment them to the original query to create avalid reformulation. We then evaluate our approach by showing that ourreformulation strategy produces results that are more informative when comparedwith state-of-the-art

Security and Privacy of performing Data Analytics in the cloud - A  three-way handshake of Technology, Policy, and Management

  Cloud platform came into existence primarily to accelerate IT delivery and topromote innovation. To this point, it has performed largely well to theexpectations of technologists, businesses and customers. The service aspect ofthis technology has paved the road for a faster set up of infrastructure andrelated goals for both startups and established organizations. This has furtherled to quicker delivery of many user-friendly applications to the market whileproving to be a commercially viable option to companies with limited resources.On the technology front, the creation and adoption of this ecosystem hasallowed easy collection of massive data from various sources at one place,where the place is sometimes referred as just the cloud. Efficient data miningcan be performed on raw data to extract potentially useful information, whichwas not possible at this scale before. Targeted advertising is a common examplethat can help businesses. Despite these promising offerings, concerns aroundsecurity and privacy of user information suppressed wider acceptance and anall-encompassing deployment of the cloud platform. In this paper, we discusssecurity and privacy concerns that occur due to data exchanging hands between acloud servicer provider (CSP) and the primary cloud user - the data collector,from the content generator. We offer solutions that encompass technology,policy and sound management of the cloud service asserting that this approachhas the potential to provide a holistic solution.

WhatsApp security and role of metadata in preserving privacy

  WhatsApp messenger is arguably the most popular mobile app available on allsmart-phones. Over one billion people worldwide for free messaging, calling,and media sharing use it. In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a defaultend-to-end encrypted service. This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls,videos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read byany unauthorized entity since WhatsApp. In this paper we analyze the WhatsAppmessaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus onits privacy preservation mechanisms. We report that the Signal Protocol, whichforms the basis of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption, does offer protectionagainst forward secrecy, and MITM to a large extent. Finally, we argue thatsimply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy. The metadatacan reveal just enough information to show connections between people, theirpatterns, and personal information. This paper elaborates on the securityarchitecture of WhatsApp and performs an analysis on the various protocolsused. This enlightens us on the status quo of the app security and what furthermeasures can be used to fill existing gaps without compromising the usability.We start by describing the following (i) important concepts that need to beunderstood to properly understand security, (ii) the security architecture,(iii) security evaluation, (iv) followed by a summary of our work. Some of theimportant concepts that we cover in this paper before evaluating thearchitecture are - end-to-end encryption (E2EE), signal protocol, andcurve25519. The description of the security architecture covers key management,end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp, Authentication Mechanism, Message Exchange,and finally the security evaluation. We then cover importance of metadata androle it plays in conserving privacy with respect to whatsapp.
