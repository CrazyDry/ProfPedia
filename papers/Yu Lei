On Conditional Correlations

  The Pearson correlation, correlation ratio, and maximal correlation have beenwell-studied in the literature. In this paper, we studied the conditionalversions of these quantities. We extend the most important properties of theunconditional versions to the conditional versions, and also derive some newproperties.

Bounds on the Average Distance and Distance Enumerator with Applications  to Non-Interactive Simulation

  We leverage proof techniques in coding theory and Fourier analysis to derivenew bounds for the problem of non-interactive simulation of random variables.Previous bounds in the literature were derived by applying data processinginequalities concerning maximal correlation or hypercontractivity. We show thatour bounds are sharp in some regimes, and are also tighter than the existingones in some other regimes. Furthermore, as by-products of our analyses,various new properties of the average distance and distance enumerator ofbinary block codes are established.

Strong magneto-optical response enabled by quantum two level systems

  The magneto-optical effect breaks time-reversal symmetry, a unique propertythat makes it indispensable in nonreciprocal optics and topological photonics.Unfortunately, all natural materials have a rather weak magneto-opticalresponse in the optical frequency range, posing a significant challenge to thepractical application of many emerging device concepts. Here we theoreticallypropose a composite material system that exhibits an intrinsic magneto-opticalresponse orders of magnitude stronger than most magneto-optical materials usedtoday. This is achieved by tailoring the resonant interplay between the quantumelectrodynamics of electronic transitions in two-level systems and theclassical electromagnetic response of local plasmon resonance.

Strategy for designing broadband epsilon-near-zero metamaterial with  loss compensation by gain media

  A strategy is proposed to design the broadband gain-doped epsilon-near-zero(GENZ) metamaterial. Based on the Milton representation of effectivepermittivity, the strategy starts in a dimensionless spectral space, where theeffective permittivity of GENZ metamaterial is simply determined by a pole-zerostructure corresponding to the operating frequency range. The physicalstructure of GENZ metamaterial is retrieved from the pole-zero structure via atractable inverse problem. The strategy is of great advantage in practicalapplications and also theoretically reveals the cancellation mechanismdominating the broadband near-zero permittivity phenomenon in the spectralspace.

Experimental evidence of optical analogue of electromagnetically induced  transparency in graphene

  We demonstrate the first experimental observation of coherent populationoscillation, an optical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency,in graphene based on phase sensitive pump-probe system. Degeneratefour-wave-mixing between pump and probe modifies the dispersion and absorptionof the population oscillation process in graphene, and leads to enhance anddepression of modulation instability with asymmetry in frequency. Theanalytically predicted asymmetrical burning hole fully consists with theexperiments.

Analysis of Spreading Speeds with an Application to Cellular Neural  Networks

  In this paper, we focus on some properties of the spreading speeds which canbe estimated by linear operators approach, such as the sign, the continuity anda limiting case which admits no spreading phenomenon. These theoretical resultsare well applied to study the effect of templates on propagation speeds forcellular neural networks (CNNs), which admit three kinds of propagatingphenomenon.

Integrated optical devices based on broadband epsilon-near-zero  meta-atoms

  We verify the feasibility of the proposed theoretical strategy for designingthe broadband near-zero permittivity (ENZ) metamaterial at optical frequencyrange with numerical simulations. In addition, the designed broadband ENZ stackare used as meta-atoms to build functional nanophotonic devices withextraordinary properties, including an ultranarrow electromagnetic energytunneling channel and an ENZ concave focusing lens.

Electric control of spin in monolayer WSe2 field effect transistors

  We report a first principles theoretical investigation of quantum transportin monolayer WSe2 field effect transistor (FET). Due to a strong spin-orbitinteraction (SOI) and the atomic structure of the two-dimensional (2D) lattice,monolayer WSe2 has an interesting electronic structure that exhibitsZeeman-like up-down spin texture near the K and K' points of the Brillouinzone. In a FET, the gate electric field induces an extra, externally tunableSOI that re-orients the spins into a Rashba-like texture thereby realizingelectric control of the spin. Quantum transport is modulated by the spintexture, namely by if the spin orientation of the carrier after the gatedchannel region, matches or miss-matches that of the FET drain electrode. Thecarrier current in the FET is labelled both the spin index and the valleyindex, realizing spintronics and valleytronics in the same device.

Fiber based source of photon pairs at telecom band with high temporal  coherence and brightness for quantum information processing

  We experimentally demonstrate a bright pulsed source of correlated photonpairs at 1550 nm telecom band by pumping 300 m dispersion shifted fiber with a4 ps pulse train. We investigate the coherence property of the source bymeasuring the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}$ ofindividual signal (idler) photons. A preliminary Hong-Ou-Mandel type two-photoninterference experiment with two such sources confirms the high temporal andspatial coherence of the source. The source is suitable for multi-photonquantum interference of independent sources, required in quantum informationprocessing.

Existence of global weak solutions for the  Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Boltzmann equations

  A moderately thick spray can be described by a coupled system of equationsconsisting of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and theVlasov-Boltzmann equation. We investigate this kind of mathematical model inthis paper. In particular, we study the initial value problem for theNavier-Stokes-Vlasov-Boltzmann equations. The existence of global weaksolutions is established by a weak convergence method.  The interesting point of our main result is to handle the model with somebreakup effects while the velocity of particles is in the whole space.

On mean field limit for Brownian particles with Coulomb interaction in  3D

  In this paper, we consider the mean field limit of Brownian particles withCoulomb interaction in 3D space. In particular, using a symmetrizationtechnique, we show that the limit measure almost surely is a weak solution tothe limiting nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. By proving that the energyalmost surely is bounded by the initial energy, we improve the regularity ofthe weak solutions. Moreover, by a natural assumption, we establish the weakstrong uniqueness principle, which is closely related to the propagation ofchaos.

On Singularity Formation of a Nonlinear Nonlocal System

  We investigate the singularity formation of a nonlinear nonlocal system. Thisnonlocal system is a simplified one-dimensional system of the 3D model that wasrecently proposed by Hou and Lei in [13] for axisymmetric 3D incompressibleNavier-Stokes equations with swirl. The main difference between the 3D model ofHou and Lei and the reformulated 3D Navier-Stokes equations is that theconvection term is neglected in the 3D model. In the nonlocal system weconsider in this paper, we replace the Riesz operator in the 3D model by theHilbert transform. One of the main results of this paper is that we proverigorously the finite time singularity formation of the nonlocal system for alarge class of smooth initial data with finite energy. We also prove the globalregularity for a class of smooth initial data. Numerical results will bepresented to demonstrate the asymptotically self-similar blow-up of thesolution. The blowup rate of the self-similar singularity of the nonlocalsystem is similar to that of the 3D model.

SBV-like regularity for general hyperbolic systems of conservation laws

  We prove the SBV regularity of the characteristic speed of the scalarhyperbolic conservation law and SBV-like regularity of the eigenvalue functionsof the Jacobian matrix of flux function for general systems of conservationlaws.  More precisely, for the equation u_t + f(u)_x = 0, \quad u : \R^+ \times \R\to \Omega \subset \R^N, we only assume the flux $f$ is $C^2$ function in thescalar case (N=1) and Jacobian matrix $Df$ has distinct real eigenvalues in thesystem case $(N\geq 2)$. Using the modification of the main decay estimate inLau and localization method applied in \cite{R}, we show that for the scalarequation $f'(u)$ belongs to SBV, and for system of conservation laws the scalarmeasure \[\big(D_u \lambda_i(u) \cdot r_i(u) \big) \big(l_i(u) \cdot u_x \big)]has no Cantor part, where $\lambda_i$, $r_i$, $l_i$ are the $i$-th eigenvalue,$i$-th right eigenvector and $i$-th left eigenvector of the matrix $Df$.

Liquid marbles as thermally robust droplets: coating-assisted  Leidenfrost-like effect

  The Leidenfrost effect-prolonged evaporation of droplets on a superheatedsurface-happens only when the surface temperature is above a certaintransitional value. Here, we show that specially engineered droplets - liquidmarbles - can exhibit similar effect at any superheated temperatures (up to 465oC tested in our experiment) without a transition. Very possibly, thisphenomenon is due to the fact that liquid marbles are droplets coated withmicroparticles and these microparticles help levitate the liquid core andmaintain an insulation layer between the liquid and the superheated surface.

Global structure of admissible BV solutions to piecewise genuinely  nonlinear, strictly hyperbolic conservation laws in one space dimension

  The paper gives an accurate description of the qualitative structure of anadmissible BV solution to a strictly hyperbolic, piecewise genuinely nonlinearsystem of conservation laws. We prove that there are a countable set $\Theta$which contains all interaction points and a family of countably many Lipschitzcurves $\T$ such that outside $\T\cup \Theta$ $u$ is continuous, and along thecurves in $\T$, u has left and right limit except for points in $\Theta$. Thisextends the corresponding structural result in \cite{BL,Liu1} for admissiblesolutions.  The proof is based on approximate wave-front tracking solutions and a properselection of discontinuity curves in the approximate solutions, which convergeto curves covering the discontinuities in the exact solution $u$.

Deep Learning for Answer Sentence Selection

  Answer sentence selection is the task of identifying sentences that containthe answer to a given question. This is an important problem in its own rightas well as in the larger context of open domain question answering. We proposea novel approach to solving this task via means of distributed representations,and learn to match questions with answers by considering their semanticencoding. This contrasts prior work on this task, which typically relies onclassifiers with large numbers of hand-crafted syntactic and semantic featuresand various external resources. Our approach does not require any featureengineering nor does it involve specialist linguistic data, making this modeleasily applicable to a wide range of domains and languages. Experimentalresults on a standard benchmark dataset from TREC demonstrate that---despiteits simplicity---our model matches state of the art performance on the answersentence selection task.

Distortion Bounds for Source Broadcast Problems

  This paper investigates the joint source-channel coding problem of sending amemoryless source over a memoryless broadcast channel. An inner bound andseveral outer bounds on the admissible distortion region are derived, whichrespectively generalize and unify several existing bounds. As a consequence, wealso obtain an inner bound and an outer bound for the degraded broadcastchannel case. When specialized to the Gaussian or binary source broadcast, theinner bound and outer bound not only recover the best known inner bound andouter bound in the literature, but also generate some new results. Besides, wealso extend the inner bound and outer bounds to the Wyner-Ziv source broadcastproblem, i.e., source broadcast with side information available at decoders.Some new bounds are obtained when specialized to the Wyner-Ziv Gaussian andWyner-Ziv binary cases.

Distortion Bounds for Transmitting Correlated Sources with Common Part  over MAC

  This paper investigates the joint source-channel coding problem of sendingtwo correlated memoryless sources with common part over a memoryless multipleaccess channel (MAC). An inner bound and two outer bounds on the achievabledistortion region are derived. In particular, they respectively recover theexisting bounds for several special cases, such as communication without commonpart, lossless communication, and noiseless communication. When specialized toquadratic Gaussian communication case, transmitting Gaussian sources withGaussian common part over Gaussian MAC, the inner bound and outer bound areused to generate two new bounds. Numerical result shows that common partimproves the distortion of such distributed source-channel coding problem.

Local exact boundary controllability of entropy solutions to a class of  hyperbolic systems of conservation laws

  In this paper, we study the local exact boundary controllability of entropysolutions to a class linearly degenerate hyperbolic systems of conservationlaws with constant multiplicity. The authors prove the two-sided boundarycontrollability, one-sided boundary controllability and two-sidedcontrollability with less controls, by applying the strategy used originallyfor classical solutions with essential modifications. Our constructive methodis based on the well-posedness of semi-global solutions constructed by thelimit of $ \e $-approximate front tracking solutions to the mixedinitial-boundary value problem with general nonlinear boundary conditions andsome further properties on both $ \e $-approximate front tracking solutions andentropy solutions.

Comments on "Approximate Characterizations for the Gaussian Source  Broadcast Distortion Region"

  Recently, Tian et al. [1] considered joint source-channel coding oftransmitting a Gaussian source over $K$-user Gaussian broadcast channel, andderived an outer bound on the admissible distortion region. In [1], they stated"due to its nonlinear form, it appears difficult to determine whether it isalways looser than the trivial outer bound in all distortion regimes withbandwidth compression". However, in this correspondence we solve this problemand prove that for the bandwidth expansion case ($K\geq2$), this outer bound isstrictly tighter than the trivial outer bound with each user being optimal inthe point-to-point setting; while for the bandwidth compression or bandwidthmatch case, this outer bound actually degenerates to the trivial outer bound.Therefore, our results imply that on one hand, the outer bound given in [1] isnontrivial only for Gaussian broadcast communication ($K\geq2$) with bandwidthexpansion; on the other hand, unfortunately, no nontrivial outer bound existsso far for Gaussian broadcast communication ($K\geq2$) with bandwidthcompression.

Online Segment to Segment Neural Transduction

  We introduce an online neural sequence to sequence model that learns toalternate between encoding and decoding segments of the input as it is read. Byindependently tracking the encoding and decoding representations our algorithmpermits exact polynomial marginalization of the latent segmentation duringtraining, and during decoding beam search is employed to find the bestalignment path together with the predicted output sequence. Our model tacklesthe bottleneck of vanilla encoder-decoders that have to read and memorize theentire input sequence in their fixed-length hidden states before producing anyoutput. It is different from previous attentive models in that, instead oftreating the attention weights as output of a deterministic function, our modelassigns attention weights to a sequential latent variable which can bemarginalized out and permits online generation. Experiments on abstractivesentence summarization and morphological inflection show significantperformance gains over the baseline encoder-decoders.

Generalized Common Informations: Measuring Commonness by the Conditional  Maximal Correlation

  In literature, different common informations were defined by G\'acs andK\"orner, by Wyner, and by Kumar, Li, and Gamal, respectively. In this paper,we define two generalized versions of common informations, named approximateand exact information-correlation functions, by exploiting the conditionalmaximal correlation as a commonness or privacy measure. These two generalizedcommon informations encompass the notions of G\'acs-K\"orner's, Wyner's, andKumar-Li-Gamal's common informations as special cases. Furthermore, to giveoperational characterizations of these two generalized common informations, wealso study the problems of private sources synthesis and common informationextraction, and show that the information-correlation functions are equal tothe minimum rates of commonness needed to ensure that some conditional maximalcorrelation constraints are satisfied for the centralized setting versions ofthese problems. As a byproduct, the conditional maximal correlation has beenstudied as well.

The Neural Noisy Channel

  We formulate sequence to sequence transduction as a noisy channel decodingproblem and use recurrent neural networks to parameterise the source andchannel models. Unlike direct models which can suffer from explaining-awayeffects during training, noisy channel models must produce outputs that explaintheir inputs, and their component models can be trained with not only pairedtraining samples but also unpaired samples from the marginal outputdistribution. Using a latent variable to control how much of the conditioningsequence the channel model needs to read in order to generate a subsequentsymbol, we obtain a tractable and effective beam search decoder. Experimentalresults on abstractive sentence summarisation, morphological inflection, andmachine translation show that noisy channel models outperform direct models,and that they significantly benefit from increased amounts of unpaired outputdata that direct models cannot easily use.

Optical puff mediated laminar-turbulent polarization transition

  Various physical structures exhibit a fundamentally probabilistic nature overdiverse scales in space and time, to the point that the demarcation linebetween quantum and classic laws gets blurred. Here, we characterize theprobability of intermittency in the laminar-turbulence transition of apartially mode-locked fiber laser system, whose degree of coherence isdeteriorated by multiple mode mixing. Two competing processes, namely theproliferation and the decay of an optical turbulent puff, determine a criticalbehavior for the onset of turbulence in such a nonlinear dissipative system. Anew kind of optical rogue waves, polarization rogue waves, is introduced at thepoint of transition to polarization turbulence. The probabilistic descriptionof the puff-mediated laminar-turbulence polarization transition provides anadditional degree of freedom for our understanding of the complex physics oflasers.

Wyner's Common Information under RÃ©nyi Divergence Measures

  We study a generalized version of Wyner's common information problem (alsocoined the distributed sources simulation problem). The original commoninformation problem consists in understanding the minimum rate of the commoninput to independent processors to generate an approximation of a jointdistribution when the distance measure used to quantify the discrepancy betweenthe synthesized and target distributions is the normalized relative entropy.Our generalization involves changing the distance measure to the unnormalizedand normalized R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha=1+s\in[0,2]$. We show thatthe minimum rate needed to ensure the R\'enyi divergences between thedistribution induced by a code and the target distribution vanishes remains thesame as the one in Wyner's setting, except when the order $\alpha=1+s=0$. Thisimplies that Wyner's common information is rather robust to the choice ofdistance measure employed. As a by product of the proofs used to the establishthe above results, the exponential strong converse for the common informationproblem under the total variation distance measure is established.

Local exact one-sided boundary null controllability of entropy solutions  to a class of hyperbolic systems of balance laws

  We consider nxn hyperbolic systems of balance laws in one-space dimensionunder the assumption that all negative (resp. positive) characteristics arelinearly degenerate. We prove the local exact one-sided boundary nullcontrollability of entropy solutions to this class of systems, whichgeneralizes the corresponding results from the case without source terms tothat with source terms. In order to apply the strategy used for conservationlaw, we essentially modify the constructive method by introducing two differentkinds of approximate solutions to system in the forward sense and to the systemin the rightward (resp. leftward) sense, respectively, and we prove that theirlimit solutions are equivalent to some extend.

Beyond the Central Limit Theorem: Universal and Non-universal  Simulations of Random Variables by General Mappings

  Motivated by the Central Limit Theorem, in this paper, we study bothuniversal and non-universal simulations of random variables with an arbitrarytarget distribution $Q_{Y}$ by general mappings, not limited to linear ones (asin the Central Limit Theorem). We derive the fastest convergence rate of theapproximation errors for such problems. Interestingly, we show that fordiscontinuous or absolutely continuous $P_{X}$, the approximation error for theuniversal simulation is almost as small as that for the non-universal one; andmoreover, for both universal and non-universal simulations, the approximationerrors by general mappings are strictly smaller than those by linear mappings.Furthermore, we also generalize these results to simulation from Markovprocesses, and simulation of random elements (or general random variables).

Sentence Encoding with Tree-constrained Relation Networks

  The meaning of a sentence is a function of the relations that hold betweenits words. We instantiate this relational view of semantics in a series ofneural models based on variants of relation networks (RNs) which represent aset of objects (for us, words forming a sentence) in terms of representationsof pairs of objects. We propose two extensions to the basic RN model fornatural language. First, building on the intuition that not all word pairs areequally informative about the meaning of a sentence, we use constraints basedon both supervised and unsupervised dependency syntax to control whichrelations influence the representation. Second, since higher-order relationsare poorly captured by a sum of pairwise relations, we use a recurrentextension of RNs to propagate information so as to form representations ofhigher order relations. Experiments on sentence classification, sentence pairclassification, and machine translation reveal that, while basic RNs are onlymodestly effective for sentence representation, recurrent RNs with latentsyntax are a reliably powerful representational device.

When Collaborative Filtering Meets Reinforcement Learning

  In this paper, we study a multi-step interactive recommendation problem,where the item recommended at current step may affect the quality of futurerecommendations. To address the problem, we develop a novel and effectiveapproach, named CFRL, which seamlessly integrates the ideas of bothcollaborative filtering (CF) and reinforcement learning (RL). Morespecifically, we first model the recommender-user interactive recommendationproblem as an agent-environment RL task, which is mathematically described by aMarkov decision process (MDP). Further, to achieve collaborativerecommendations for the entire user community, we propose a novel CF-based MDPby encoding the states of all users into a shared latent vector space. Finally,we propose an effective Q-network learning method to learn the agent's optimalpolicy based on the CF-based MDP. The capability of CFRL is demonstrated bycomparing its performance against a variety of existing methods on real-worlddatasets.

Differentially Private Model Publishing for Deep Learning

  Deep learning techniques based on neural networks have shown significantsuccess in a wide range of AI tasks. Large-scale training datasets are one ofthe critical factors for their success. However, when the training datasets arecrowdsourced from individuals and contain sensitive information, the modelparameters may encode private information and bear the risks of privacyleakage. The recent growing trend of the sharing and publishing of pre-trainedmodels further aggravates such privacy risks. To tackle this problem, wepropose a differentially private approach for training neural networks. Ourapproach includes several new techniques for optimizing both privacy loss andmodel accuracy. We employ a generalization of differential privacy calledconcentrated differential privacy(CDP), with both a formal and refined privacyloss analysis on two different data batching methods. We implement a dynamicprivacy budget allocator over the course of training to improve model accuracy.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively improvesprivacy loss accounting, training efficiency and model quality under a givenprivacy budget.

The First Pulsar Discovered by FAST

  To assist with the commissioning (Jiang et al. 2019) of theFive-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we performed apulsar search, with the primary goal of developing and testing the pulsar dataacquisition and processing pipelines. We tested and used three pipelines, two(P1 and P2 hereafter) searched for the periodic signature of pulsars whereasthe other one was used to search for bright single pulses (P3 hereafter). Apulsar candidate was discovered in the observation on the 22nd August, 2017,and later confirmed by the Parkes radio telescope on the 10th September, 2017.This pulsar, named PSR J1900-0134, was the first pulsar discovered by FAST. Thepulsar has a pulse period of 1.8 s and a dispersion measure (DM) of188\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$.

Some new progress on the light absorption properties of linear alkyl  benzene solvent

  Linear alkyl benzene (LAB) will be used as the solvent of a liquidscintillator mixture for the JUNO antineutrino experiment in the near future.Its light absorption property should therefore be understood prior to itseffective use in the experiment. Attenuation length measurements at a lightwavelength of 430 nm have been performed on samples of LAB prepared for thepurpose of the JUNO experiment. Inorganic impurities in LAB have also beenstudied for their possibilities of light absorption in our wavelength ofinterest. In view of a tentative plan by the JUNO collaboration to utilizeneutron capture with hydrogen in the detector, we have also presented in thiswork, a study on the carbon-hydrogen ratio and the relationship thereof withthe attenuation length of the samples.

The radiation mechanism of fast radio bursts

  Fast radio bursts are radio transients observed mainly around 1.5 GHz. Theirpeak frequency decreases at a rate of 100 ~ 500 MHz/s and some of them have abroader pulse with an exponentially decaying tail. Common assumptions for fastradio bursts include a dispersion effect resulting in the peak frequencydrifting and a scattering effect resulting in pulse broadening. Theseassumptions attribute the abnormally large dispersion measure and scatteringmeasure to the environmental medium of the host galaxy. Here we show that theradiation of fast radio bursts can be explained as an undulator radiation andthe large dispersion measure can be due to a motion effect mainly from therotation of the source which is probably variable stars. In our scenario, thepulse broadening is near-field effects and the pulse itself represents aFresnel diffraction pattern sweeping the observer. Our work is the firstanalysis of properties of fast radio bursts in the context of a specialmechanism of the radiation instead of a special propagation environment of theradiation.

Phase-resolved spectral analysis of 4U 1901+03 during its outburst

  The high mass X-ray binary 4U 1901+03 was reported to have the pulse profileevolving with the X-ray luminosity and energy during its outburst inFebruary-July 2003: the pulse peak changed from double to single along with thedecreasing luminosity. We have carried out a detailed analysis on thecontemporary phase-resolved energy spectrum of 4U 1901+03 as observed by RossiX-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We find that, both the continuum and the pulsespectra are phase dependent. The optical depth derived from the pulse spectrumis in general larger than that from the continuum. Fe Ka emission line is onlydetected in the spectrum of the continuum and is missing in the pulse spectrum.This suggests an origin of Fe emission from the accretion disk but not thesurface of the neutron star.

Quantum phase transitions for two coupled sites with dipole-coupled  effective Jaynes-Cummings model

  The nature of the ground states for a system composed of two coupled cavitieswith each containing a pair of dipole-coupled two-level atoms are studied overa wide range of detunings and dipole coupling strengths. The cases for threelimits of exact resonance, large positive and negative detunings are discussed,and four types of the ground states are revealed. Then the phase diagrams ofthe ground state are plotted by choosing three different "order parameters". Wefind that the phase space, determined by the combinative action of detuning andthe dipole coupling strength, is divided into four regions. This is differentfrom the general Bose-Hubbard model and more richer physics are presented inthe two-site coupled cavities system. That is, the insulator region may bepolaritonic or atomic and the superfluid region may be polaritonic or photonicin nature.

On the Capacity of the K-User Cyclic Gaussian Interference Channel

  This paper studies the capacity region of a $K$-user cyclic Gaussianinterference channel, where the $k$th user interferes with only the $(k-1)$thuser (mod $K$) in the network. Inspired by the work of Etkin, Tse and Wang,which derived a capacity region outer bound for the two-user Gaussianinterference channel and proved that a simple Han-Kobayashi power splittingscheme can achieve to within one bit of the capacity region for all values ofchannel parameters, this paper shows that a similar strategy also achieves thecapacity region for the $K$-user cyclic interference channel to within aconstant gap in the weak interference regime. Specifically, a compactrepresentation of the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region usingFourier-Motzkin elimination is first derived, a capacity region outer bound isthen established. It is shown that the Etkin-Tse-Wang power splitting strategygives a constant gap of at most two bits (or one bit per dimension) in the weakinterference regime. Finally, the capacity result of the $K$-user cyclicGaussian interference channel in the strong interference regime is also given.

Ultra-Thin Double-Walled Carbon Nanotubes A Novel Nanocontainer for  Preparing Atomic Wires

  Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) with high graphitization have beensynthesized by hydrogen arc discharge. The obtained DWCNTs have a narrowdistribution of diameters of both the inner and outer tubes, and more than halfof the DWCNTs have inner diameters in the range 0.6-1.0 nm. Field electronemission from a DWCNT cathode to an anode has been measured, and the emissioncurrent density of DWCNTs reached 1 A/cm2 at an applied field of about 4.3V/{\mu}m. After high-temperature treatment of DWCNTs, long linear carbon chains(C-chains) can be grown inside the ultra-thin DWCNTs to form a novelC-chain@DWCNT nanostructure, showing that these ultra-thin DWCNTs are anappropriate nanocontainer for preparing truly one-dimensional nanostructureswith one-atom-diameter.

Capacity of the Gaussian Relay Channel with Correlated Noises to Within  a Constant Gap

  This paper studies the relaying strategies and the approximate capacity ofthe classic three-node Gaussian relay channel, but where the noises at therelay and at the destination are correlated. It is shown that the capacity ofsuch a relay channel can be achieved to within a constant gap of $\hf \log_2 3=0.7925$ bits using a modified version of the noisy network coding strategy,where the quantization level at the relay is set in a correlation dependentway. As a corollary, this result establishes that the conventionalcompress-and-forward scheme also achieves to within a constant gap to thecapacity. In contrast, the decode-and-forward and the single-tapamplify-and-forward relaying strategies can have an infinite gap to capacity inthe regime where the noises at the relay and at the destination are highlycorrelated, and the gain of the relay-to-destination link goes to infinity.

On Noisy Network Coding for a Gaussian Relay Chain Network with  Correlated Noises

  Noisy network coding, which elegantly combines the conventionalcompress-and-forward relaying strategy and ideas from network coding, hasrecently drawn much attention for its simplicity and optimality in achieving towithin constant gap of the capacity of the multisource multicast Gaussiannetwork. The constant-gap result, however, applies only to Gaussian relaynetworks with independent noises. This paper investigates the application ofnoisy network coding to networks with correlated noises. By focusing on afour-node Gaussian relay chain network with a particular noise correlationstructure, it is shown that noisy network coding can no longer achieve towithin constant gap to capacity with the choice of Gaussian inputs and Gaussianquantization. The cut-set bound of the relay chain network in this particularcase, however, can be achieved to within half a bit by a simple concatenationof a correlation-aware noisy network coding strategy and a decode-and-forwardscheme.

QCD NLO and EW NLO corrections to $t\bar{t}H$ production with top quark  decays at hadron collider

  Higgs boson production associated with a top quark pair is an importantprocess in studying the nature of the newly discovered Higgs boson at the LHC.In this letter, we report on our calculations including the next-to-leadingorder (NLO) QCD and NLO electroweak corrections to the $pp\to t\bar{t}H$process in the standard model. We present the integrated cross sections at the$14~{\rm TeV}$ LHC and even at the future proton-proton colliders with$\sqrt{s}=33$ and $100~{\rm TeV}$. Our calculation includes the top quarksubsequent decays by adopting the narrow width approximation. The kinematicdistributions of Higgs boson and top quark decay products at the LHC areprovided. We find that the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2\alpha_{ew}^2)$ corrections arequantitatively comparable with the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3\alpha_{ew})$corrections in some kinematic region.

The Fundamental Plane Relation of Early-Type Galaxies: Environmental  Dependence

  Using a sample of 70,793 early-type galaxies from SDSS DR7, we study theenvironmental dependence of the fundamental plane relation. With the help ofthe galaxy group catalogue based on SDSS DR7, we calculate the fundamentalplanes in different dark matter halo mass bins for central and satellitegalaxies respectively. We find the environmental dependence of the fundamentalplane coefficients are similar in $g$, $r$, $i$ and $z$ bands. Theenvironmental dependence for central and satellite galaxies is significantlydifferent. While the fundamental plane coefficients of centrals varysystematically with the halo mass, those of satellites are similar in differenthalo mass bins. The discrepancy between centrals and satellites are significantin small halos, but negligible in the largest halo mass bins. These resultsremain the same when we only keep red galaxies, or galaxies with $b/a>0.6$, orgalaxies in a specific radius range in the sample. After the correction of thesky background, results are still similar. We suggest that the differentenvironmental effects of the halo mass on centrals and satellites may arisefrom the different quenching processes of them.

Electroweak radiative corrections to $W^+W^-Î³$ production at the  ILC

  We provide and discuss the precision predictions for the $W^+W^-\gamma$production at the ILC including the full electroweak (EW) one-loop correctionsand high order initial state radiation (ISR) contributions in the StandardModel. The dependence of the leading order (LO) and EW corrected cross sectionson the colliding energy is investigated. We find that the EW correctionsuppresses the LO cross section significantly, and the ISR effect beyond ${\calO}(\alpha)$ is important near the threshold, but is negligible in the highenergy region. We provide the LO and EW corrected distributions of thetransverse momenta and rapidities of final $W^-$-boson and photon as well asthe $W$-pair invariant mass. From the various kinematic distributions, we findthat EW correction strongly depends on the final state phase space. Weinvestigate the leptonic decays of the final W-boson pair by adopting thenarrow width approximation (NWA), and find that the final produced photon andleptons can be well separated from each other.

Joint Deep Modeling of Users and Items Using Reviews for Recommendation

  A large amount of information exists in reviews written by users. This sourceof information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systemswhile it can potentially alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the qualityof recommendations. In this paper, we present a deep model to learn itemproperties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model,named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallelneural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses onlearning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the otherone learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A sharedlayer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. Theshared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interactwith each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques.Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms allbaseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.

Unusual magnetic structure of high-pressure synthesized perovskites  ACrO3(A=Sc, In, Tl)

  Magnetic structures of metastable perovskites ScCrO3, InCrO3 and TlCrO3,stabilized under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, have beenstudied by neutron powder diffraction. Similar to the other orthochromitesLnCrO3 (Ln=lanthanide or Y), these materials crystallize into the orthorhombicstructure with Pnma10 symmetry. The spin configuration of the metastableperovskites has been found to be C-type, contrasting with the G-type structureusually observed in LnCrO3. First-principles calculations demonstrate that theCtype structure found in ScCrO3 and InCrO3 is attributed to a ferromagnetic(FM) nearest-neighbor interaction, while in TlCrO3, this type of magneticordering is stabilized by a strong next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic(AFM) exchange. The spins in the C-type magnetic structure line up along theorthorhombic b-axis, yielding the Pnma magnetic symmetry. The dominantmechanism controlling this spin direction has been concluded to be the singleion anisotropy imposed by a uniaxial distortion of CrO6 octahedra.

Topological semimetal state and field-induced Fermi surface  reconstruction in antiferromagnetic monopnictide NdSb

  We report the experimental realization of Dirac semimetal state in NdSb, amaterial with antiferromagnetic ground state. The occurrence of topologicalsemimetal state has been well supported by our band structure calculations andthe experimental observation of chiral anomaly induced negativemagnetoresistance. A field-induced Fermi surface reconstruction is observed, inresponse to the change of spin polarization. The observation of topologicalsemimetal state in a magnetic material provides an opportunity to investigatethe magneto-topological phenomena.

Minimum Enclosing Circle of a Set of Static Points with Dynamic Weight  from One Free Point

  Given a set $S$ of $n$ static points and a free point $p$ in the Euclideanplane, we study a new variation of the minimum enclosing circle problem, inwhich a dynamic weight that equals to the reciprocal of the distance from thefree point $p$ to the undetermined circle center is included. In this work, weprove the optimal solution of the new problem is unique and lies on theboundary of the farthest-point Voronoi diagram of $S$, once $p$ does notcoincide with any vertex of the convex hull of $S$. We propose a tree structureconstructed from the boundary of the farthest-point Voronoi diagram and use thehierarchical relationship between edges to locate the optimal solution. Theplane could be divide into at most $3n-4$ non-overlapping regions. When $p$lies in one of the regions, the optimal solution locates at one node or lies onthe interior of one edge in the boundary of the farthest-point Voronoi diagram.Moreover, we apply the new variation to calculate the maximum displacement ofone point $p$ under the condition that the displacements of points in $S$ arerestricted in 2D rigid motion.

Empirical Evaluation of Parallel Training Algorithms on Acoustic  Modeling

  Deep learning models (DLMs) are state-of-the-art techniques in speechrecognition. However, training good DLMs can be time consuming especially forproduction-size models and corpora. Although several parallel trainingalgorithms have been proposed to improve training efficiency, there is no clearguidance on which one to choose for the task in hand due to lack of systematicand fair comparison among them. In this paper we aim at filling this gap bycomparing four popular parallel training algorithms in speech recognition,namely asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD), blockwise model-updatefiltering (BMUF), bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) and elastic averagingstochastic gradient descent (EASGD), on 1000-hour LibriSpeech corpora usingfeed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional, long short-termmemory, DNNs (CLDNNs). Based on our experiments, we recommend using BMUF as thetop choice to train acoustic models since it is most stable, scales well withnumber of GPUs, can achieve reproducible results, and in many cases evenoutperforms single-GPU SGD. ASGD can be used as a substitute in some cases.

Extreme anisotropy and anomalous transport properties of heavily  electron doped Lix(NH3)yFe2Se2 single crystals

  The missing hole packets near the Brillouin zone center render uniqueelectronic structures to the heavily electron doped FeSe-based superconductorswith Tc above 40 K. It challenges the existing scenario accounting for thenature of superconductivity in the iron-based family. Yet, one hurdle that hasto be overcome is the materials complexity in the rather limited number ofcompounds. Here we report the growth of heavily electron doped Li-NH3intercalated FeSe single crystals that are free of such complexities and allowaccess to the intrinsic superconducting properties. Our results show extremelylarge electronic anisotropy in both normal and superconducting states.Moreover, the anomalous transport properties appear in normal state, which arebelieved related to the anisotropy of relaxation time and/or temperaturedependent electron carrier concentration. In view of the great chemicalflexibility of intercalants, our findings provide novel platform tounderstanding of superconductivity origin of FeSe-related superconductors.

Electromagnetic Scattering Laws in Weyl Systems

  Wavelength determines the length scale of the cross section whenelectromagnetic waves are scattered by an electrically small object. The crosssection diverges for resonant scattering, and diminishes for non-resonantscattering, when wavelength approaches infinity. This scattering law explainsthe color of the sky as well as the strength of a mobile phone signal. We showthat such wavelength scaling comes from free space's conical dispersion at zerofrequency. Emerging Weyl systems, offering similar dispersion at non-zerofrequencies, lead to new laws of electromagnetic scattering that allow crosssections to be decoupled from the wavelength limit. Diverging and diminishingcross sections can be realized at any target wavelength in a Weyl system,providing unprecedented ability to tailor the strength of wave-matterinteractions for radio-frequency and optical applications.
